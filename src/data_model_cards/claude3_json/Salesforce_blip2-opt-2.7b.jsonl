The Q-Former bridges the gap between the frozen image encoder and LLM. It has two transformer submodules that share the same self-attention layers: (1) an image transformer that interacts with the frozen image encoder for visual feature extraction, and (2) a text transformer that can function as both a text encoder and a text decoder.\n\nThe Q-Former extracts a fixed number of output features (queries) from the image encoder, independent of input image resolution. In the experiments, 32 queries are used, where each query has a dimension of 768 (same as the hidden dimension of the Q-Former). The output query representation (denoted as Z) has a size of 32 \u00d7 768, which is much smaller than the size of frozen image features.\n\nObjectives:\nBLIP-2 is pre-trained using image-text pairs with three objectives that share the same input format and model parameters:\n\n1. Image-Text Contrastive Learning (ITC): Computes the pairwise similarity between each query output and the text representation, and selects the highest one as the image-text similarity. A unimodal self-attention mask is employed to avoid information leak between queries and text.\n\n2. Image-Text Matching (ITM): A binary classification task that predicts whether an image-text pair is positive (matched) or negative (unmatched). A bi-directional self-attention mask is used where all queries and texts can attend to each other. Each output query embedding is fed into a two-class linear classifier to obtain a logit.\n\n3.

    "answer": "Here is the compute infrastructure information for the Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b model based on the provided references:\n\nPre-training:\n- Used AdamW optimizer with \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.98, weight decay of 0.05\n- Cosine learning rate decay with peak learning rate of 1e-4 and linear warmup of 2k steps\n- Minimum learning rate at second stage is 5e-5\n- Used image size of 224x224 with random resized cropping and horizontal flipping augmentation\n- Pre-trained for 250k steps in first stage, 80k steps in second stage\n- Batch size of 2320/1680 for ViT-L/ViT-g in first stage, 1920/1520 for OPT/FlanT5 in second stage\n- Converted frozen ViTs' and LLMs' parameters to FP16, except FlanT5 which used BFloat16\n\n[More Information Needed] on the exact compute hardware (GPU/TPU types and counts) used for pre-training.\n\nInference:\nThe model can be run on GPU if available, otherwise falls back to CPU:\n\n```\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\") if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\n```\n\nTo load the model in 8-bit and automatically map to available devices:\n\n```\nmodel = Blip2ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b\", load_in_8bit=True, device_map=\"auto\")\n```\n\n[More Information Needed] on recommended GPU hardware for optimal inference performance and throughput."
