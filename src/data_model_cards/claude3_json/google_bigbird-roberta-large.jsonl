This data may contain biases, misinformation, and problematic content that could be reflected in the model's outputs. [More Information Needed] on specific risks.\n- As a large language model, BigBird may be misused to generate fake news, spam, hateful/offensive text if prompted. Appropriate safeguards are needed.\n\nTechnical limitations: \n- BigBird uses sparse attention to scale to longer sequences (4096 tokens), but theoretical analysis shows sparse attention cannot universally replace dense attention. Some tasks provably require \u03a9(n) layers with sparse attention vs O(1) with dense (full) attention.\n- Scaling limitations still exist beyond 4096 tokens. BigBird enables 8x longer context than previous models on similar hardware, but further efficiency improvements are needed.\n\nSociotechnical limitations:\n- BigBird was evaluated on academic NLP benchmarks like GLUE, but real-world use cases may reveal additional robustness and fairness issues. [More Information Needed] \n- As a large pretrained model, BigBird has high compute costs for finetuning and inference. This could lead to inequitable access. Responsible deployment practices are important to consider.\n\nIn summary, key limitations seem to be: scaling limits of sparse attention, potential biases from pretraining data, robustness to misuse, and compute-related access barriers.

    "chain": "generation",
    "answer": "Based on the provided references about the BIGBIRD model, here are some recommendations regarding foreseeable issues with google/bigbird-roberta-large:\n\n1. Sparse attention mechanisms like those used in BIGBIRD cannot universally replace dense attention mechanisms without tradeoffs. There are certain tasks that require \u03a9(n) layers for sparse attention with \u00d5(n) edges to solve, while full attention can solve in O(1) layers. This suggests BIGBIRD may require more layers and computation for certain problem types compared to dense attention.\n\n2. [More Information Needed] on the specific downstream tasks and datasets google/bigbird-roberta-large was evaluated on. The references mention GLUE benchmark results for a BIGBIRD-base model, but not the -large variant. More information is needed on the large model's performance.\n\n3. The ability for BIGBIRD to handle longer sequence lengths up to 8x previous limits is noted as a benefit that improves various NLP task performance. However, [More Information Needed] on any potential negative consequences or failure modes that may arise from significantly increasing the context window.\n\n4. [More Information Needed] on the pretraining data and methodology used for google/bigbird-roberta-large specifically. The references mention pretraining datasets and procedures for BIGBIRD models in general, but not the exact setup for this particular large variant.\n\nIn summary, while BIGBIRD enables longer context and shows promising results, the use of sparse attention may require more layers for certain tasks compared to dense attention. More specific information is needed on the large model variant's pretraining setup, downstream evaluation, and potential issues that may arise from its extended sequence length.
