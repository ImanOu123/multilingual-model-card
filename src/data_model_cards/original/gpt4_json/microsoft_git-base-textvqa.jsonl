    "answer": "Model Card for microsoft/git-base-textvqa\n\n## Model Details\nThe model, named Generative Image-to-text Transformer (GIT), is designed to unify vision-language tasks such as image/video captioning and question answering. The architecture of GIT is simplified compared to existing models, which often rely on complex structures and external modules. Our model consists of a single image encoder and a single text decoder, both of which are trained under a unified language modeling task.\n\n## Architecture\nThe image encoder is based on a contrastive pre-trained model that outputs a compact 2D feature map from raw images. This feature map is then flattened and projected into D dimensions using a linear layer and a layernorm layer. The text decoder is a transformer module with multiple blocks, each containing a self-attention layer and a feed-forward layer. The text is tokenized, embedded, and combined with positional encoding and a layernorm layer. The image features and text embeddings are concatenated and fed into the transformer module. The text is decoded in an auto-regressive manner, starting with a [BOS] token and ending with an [EOS] token or when the maximum steps are reached.\n\n## Training Procedures\nThe model is pre-trained and fine-tuned on various vision-language tasks. During fine-tuning for visual question answering (VQA), the question and ground-truth answer are concatenated, but the language modeling loss is only applied to the answer and [EOS] tokens. For image classification, the model is fine-tuned to predict class names in an auto-regressive way, treating them as image captions. The model has been scaled up in terms of pre-training data and model size to enhance performance.\n\n## Parameters\nThe model uses a shared set of projections for both image tokens and text tokens. The exact number of parameters is not specified in the provided references, so [More Information Needed] for the exact count.\n\n## Important Disclaimers\nWhile the GIT model has shown new state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, it is noted that the generative approach may result in slightly worse performance on VQAv2 compared to discriminative models. Additionally, the model's generative nature imposes more challenges as it has to predict at least two correct tokens: the answer and the [EOS] token. Furthermore, the model's performance on scene-text related VQA tasks and the new generation-based scheme for ImageNet classification and scene text recognition are highlighted as significant contributions.\n\nFor any updates or inquiries regarding the model card, please contact the project organizer responsible for overseeing the model's development and documentation."

    "answer": "The model `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` can be used for inference on images to perform tasks such as captioning and question answering. The inference can be done on a single image or multiple images without the need for fine-tuning, post-processing, or integrating into a pipeline. The model has been pre-trained and can generate text based on the input image and an optional text prefix.\n\nHere is an example code snippet for using the model to perform question answering on a single image without any additional fine-tuning or post-processing:\n\n```shell\nAZFUSE_TSV_USE_FUSE=1 python -m generativeimage2text.inference -p \"{'type': 'test_git_inference_single_image', \\\n      'image_path': 'aux_data/images/1.jpg', \\\n      'model_name': 'GIT_BASE', \\\n      'prefix': 'What is in the image?', \\\n}\"\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, the `image_path` parameter should be set to the path of the image you want to analyze, and the `prefix` parameter can be used to specify a question or a prompt for the model. The `model_name` is set to `GIT_BASE`, which refers to the base variant of the GIT model.\n\nFor multiple images, you can pass a list of image paths to the `image_path` parameter, as shown in the following code snippet for question answering:\n\n```shell\nAZFUSE_TSV_USE_FUSE=1 python -m generativeimage2text.inference -p \"{'type': 'test_git_inference_single_image', \\\n      'image_path': ['aux_data/images/1.jpg', 'aux_data/images/2.jpg', 'aux_data/images/3.jpg'], \\\n      'model_name': 'GIT_BASE_MSRVTT_QA', \\\n      'prefix': 'What is it?', \\\n}\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `image_path` parameter contains a list of image file paths, and the `model_name` is set to a specific variant of the GIT model that is suitable for the question answering task on multiple images.\n\nPlease note that the `AZFUSE_TSV_USE_FUSE=1` environment variable is set before running the Python command, which may be related to the specific setup or configuration required by the model's inference script.\n\nIf you need to perform inference on TSV files containing image data and associated questions, you can use the following code snippet:\n\n```shell\nAZFUSE_TSV_USE_FUSE=1 python -m generativeimage2text.inference -p \"{'type': 'test_git_inference_single_tsv', \\\n      'image_tsv': 'data/TaxVQAv2/test.tsv', \\\n      'model_name': 'GIT_BASE_VQAv2', \\\n      'question_tsv': 'data/TaxVQAv2/test.caption.tsv', \\\n      'out_tsv': 'inference/GIT_BASE_VQAv2/snapshot/vqav2.tsv', \\\n}\"\n```\n\nIn this case, the `image_tsv` parameter points to a TSV file containing the image data, `question_tsv` points to a TSV file containing the questions, and `out_tsv` specifies the output file for the inference results. The `model_name` is set to `GIT_BASE_VQAv2`, indicating the model variant designed for the VQA task.\n\nThese code snippets are based on the provided references and demonstrate how to use the `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` model for inference without additional fine-tuning or post-processing steps."

    "question": "downstream_use",
    "chain": "generation",
    "answer": "The `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` model is a versatile deep learning model that can be fine-tuned for various tasks related to visual language understanding, such as image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). When fine-tuned on a specific task, the model leverages its generative capabilities to produce free-form text that corresponds to the visual input it receives.\n\nFor image captioning, the model can be fine-tuned using a dataset where images are paired with descriptive captions. During fine-tuning, the model learns to generate captions that accurately describe the content of the images. The training data format for image captioning is the same as that used in pre-training, which allows the model to apply the same language modeling (LM) task for fine-tuning.\n\nFor visual question answering, the model is fine-tuned by concatenating the question with the ground-truth answer to form a special caption. The LM loss is applied only to the answer and the end-of-sentence (EOS) tokens. During inference, the model generates an answer to the visual question by interpreting the question as a caption prefix and completing the answer.\n\nThe model can also be used for image classification tasks by interpreting class names as image captions and predicting the class in an auto-regressive manner. This approach is beneficial when dealing with datasets that frequently introduce new data and categories, as the model does not rely on a predefined vocabulary or a softmax layer for classification.\n\nWhen integrating `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` into a larger ecosystem or app, the model can serve as a component that provides visual understanding capabilities. For instance, in a mobile app that assists visually impaired users, the model can generate descriptions of images or answer questions about the visual content captured by the user's camera.\n\nBelow is an example code snippet for fine-tuning the model on a captioning task, as referenced in the provided materials. Note that this is a simplified example for illustrative purposes, and the actual implementation may require additional context and setup:\n\n```python\n# Example code snippet for fine-tuning the GIT model on a captioning task\n# Note: This is a simplified example and may not run as-is.\n\nfrom generativeimage2text import train\n\n# Define the training parameters (simplified for the example)\ntraining_params = {\n    'type': 'forward_backward_example',\n    'image_files': ['aux_data/images/1.jpg', 'aux_data/images/2.jpg'],\n    # Additional parameters would be needed here\n}\n\n# Run the training script with the specified parameters\ntrain.main(training_params)\n```\n\nFor other tasks such as visual question answering, the code would be similar but with different parameters to specify the task type and input data format. The actual code for fine-tuning would depend on the specific task and dataset being used.\n\nIn summary, the `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` model is a flexible tool for various visual language tasks and can be easily integrated into applications that require understanding and generating text based on visual input."

    "question": "out_of_scope_use",
    "chain": "generation",
    "answer": "Given the capabilities and limitations of the microsoft/git-base-textvqa model as described in the references, there are several ways in which the model could potentially be misused:\n\n1. **Propagation of Biased Outputs**: As indicated in the references, the model has been evaluated for bias using the normalized performance difference (NPD) metric, and while the bias ranges are relatively low (0.7% to 5.3%), they are not zero. Users should not use the model in applications where even a small amount of bias could lead to significant negative consequences, such as in law enforcement, hiring, or any other decision-making processes that could affect people's lives based on gender or skin type.\n\n2. **Use in Safety-Critical Systems**: The model has shown impressive performance in understanding and describing visual content. However, it should not be used in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous driving or medical diagnosis, where errors or misinterpretations could lead to harm or injury, as the model's performance, while state-of-the-art, is not infallible.\n\n3. **Dissemination of Toxic Content**: The pre-training data for the model is not guaranteed to be free of toxic language, which could potentially be reflected in the model's outputs. Users should not use the model in contexts where it could generate harmful, offensive, or toxic content, especially without proper safeguards or filtering mechanisms in place.\n\n4. **Infringement of Privacy and Rights**: The model's strong capability to recognize and describe scene text and other elements could be misused for surveillance or other privacy-invasive activities. Users should not employ the model to analyze or share content that could infringe on individuals' privacy rights or intellectual property rights, such as extracting text from private documents or copyrighted materials without consent.\n\n5. **Unfair Representation and Stereotyping**: Even though the model surpasses human performance on certain benchmarks, it may still perpetuate or amplify stereotypes present in the training data. Users should avoid using the model in contexts where it could contribute to the unfair representation of individuals or groups.\n\nIn summary, users of the microsoft/git-base-textvqa model should be cautious not to use it in ways that could amplify biases, infringe on privacy, propagate toxic content, or be relied upon in safety-critical applications. It is important to consider the ethical and societal implications of deploying this model and to implement appropriate safeguards to prevent misuse."

    "question": "bias_risks_limitations",
    "chain": "generation",
    "answer": "The known or foreseeable issues stemming from the model `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` can be categorized into technical limitations and sociotechnical concerns:\n\n**Technical Limitations:**\n\n1. **Scaling Challenges:** As per the references, scaling the image encoder has shown benefits, but scaling the text decoder has not yielded improvements (Reference 3). This suggests that there might be a limit to how much the performance can be enhanced by simply increasing the model size, particularly the text decoder.\n\n2. **Data Quality and Model Capacity:** The model's performance does not always improve with the addition of more pre-training data. Specifically, the base model's performance drops when trained with 0.8 billion data points, likely due to the noisiness of the data and the limited capacity of the base model to leverage such large-scale data effectively (Reference 2).\n\n3. **Generative Model Challenges:** The generative approach chosen for the model imposes more challenges, as it requires the model to predict at least two correct tokens, including the end-of-sentence (EOS) token, which can lead to slightly worse performance on certain tasks like VQAv2 compared to discriminative approaches (References 9 and 10).\n\n**Sociotechnical Concerns:**\n\n1. **Bias and Fairness:** The model has been evaluated for bias using the normalized performance difference (NPD) metric, and while the bias ranges are relatively low (0.7% to 5.3%), there is still a presence of bias in the model's performance across different gender and skin types (References 5 and 6). This indicates that the model may not perform equally well for all demographic groups, which could lead to unequal experiences and reinforce existing stereotypes.\n\n2. **Societal Impact and Toxicity:** The model has the potential to assist visually-impaired individuals by improving performance on tasks such as image captioning and question answering. However, since the pre-training data are not guaranteed to be free of toxic language, there is a risk that the model could generate harmful or inappropriate content (Reference 8). This necessitates careful deployment and further research to mitigate the risk of propagating toxic language.\n\n3. **Misunderstandings and Misuse:** Users may misunderstand the capabilities of the model or misuse it in applications for which it was not intended or where its limitations could lead to harm. For example, over-reliance on the model for critical decision-making without understanding its limitations could lead to negative outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, while the `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` model shows state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, it is important to consider these technical and sociotechnical limitations when deploying the model in real-world applications. Continuous monitoring, evaluation, and updates to the model are necessary to address these issues and ensure responsible usage."

    "answer": "Based on the provided references, here are the recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model `microsoft/git-base-textvqa`:\n\n1. **Data and Model Monitoring**: Since the model is pre-trained on large-scale data that are not guaranteed to be free of toxic language, it is crucial to implement continuous monitoring to detect and mitigate any instances where the model might produce harmful or inappropriate content. This includes setting up automated flagging systems and human-in-the-loop review processes to ensure the outputs remain safe and respectful.\n\n2. **Inclusivity and Fairness**: Given the model's potential to assist visually-impaired individuals, it is important to ensure that the model performs equitably across diverse demographics. This involves evaluating the model's performance on datasets representing a wide range of languages, ethnicities, and cultural contexts, and making necessary adjustments to avoid biases.\n\n3. **Transparency and Documentation**: Clear documentation should be provided to users regarding the model's capabilities, limitations, and the nature of the pre-training data. This transparency can help users understand when and how to use the model effectively and ethically.\n\n4. **User Education and Guidelines**: Provide comprehensive guidelines and best practices for fine-tuning and deploying the model in various applications. This should include instructions on how to handle potential ethical issues and recommendations for responsible usage.\n\n5. **Research on Output Control**: Encourage and conduct further research on methods to control the output of the model to prevent the generation of toxic or harmful content. This could involve exploring techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), adversarial training, or controlled text generation methods.\n\n6. **Accessibility and Usability**: Ensure that the model and its associated tools, such as the fine-tuning guide, are accessible to a broad range of users, including those with disabilities. This aligns with the model's potential to aid visually-impaired individuals and reinforces the commitment to inclusivity.\n\n7. **Performance Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate the model's performance on relevant benchmarks, especially when scaling up the pre-training data or model size. Be cautious of performance drops that may occur due to data quality issues or model capacity limitations, as observed in the reference to the COCO dataset and the base model's performance with 0.8B data.\n\n8. **Ethical Review and Compliance**: Conduct an ethical review of the model's applications, especially in sensitive areas, and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory standards. This may involve consulting with lawyers, ethicists, and rights advocates to anticipate and address potential legal and ethical challenges.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, the team can help ensure that the deployment of `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` is responsible, ethical, and beneficial to society."

The images in the pre-training dataset were preprocessed to maintain an aspect ratio with the shorter side no larger than 384 pixels and the longer side no larger than 640 pixels, and saved in JPEG format with a quality of 90, resulting in a total size of 39 terabytes.

    "chain": "generation",
    "answer": "For the preprocessing of the data used in the `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` model, the following steps were taken:\n\n1. Image Preprocessing:\n   - The images were resized to ensure that the shorter side was no larger than 384 pixels and the longer side no larger than 640 pixels, while maintaining the aspect ratio. This was done to standardize the input image size and potentially reduce computational requirements during training.\n   - All images were re-saved with a JPEG quality of 90 to maintain a balance between image quality and file size. This likely helped in reducing the overall dataset size for efficient storage and processing.\n   - It is important to note that no such preprocessing was applied to the fine-tuning dataset, which implies that the fine-tuning data was used in its original form without any resizing or quality adjustments.\n\n2. Text Preprocessing:\n   - The text data was tokenized into tokens and then embedded into D dimensions. This process converts the raw text into a format that can be processed by the model, with each token being represented by a vector in a high-dimensional space.\n   - Positional encoding was added to the text embeddings, followed by a layer normalization step. This is a standard practice in transformer models to give the model information about the order of the tokens.\n   - The text begins with a [BOS] (Beginning of Sentence) token and is decoded in an auto-regressive manner until an [EOS] (End of Sentence) token is reached or the maximum number of steps is achieved. This ensures that the model generates coherent sequences of text.\n\n3. Data Format:\n   - For inference on TSV files, the data format includes an image TSV with each row containing two columns: the image key and a base64-encoded jpg or png bit string.\n   - The caption or question TSV also contains two columns per row: the image key and a list of dictionaries in JSON format for captions.\n\n4. Model Input:\n   - The image features are concatenated with the text embeddings to serve as input to the transformer module. This allows the model to consider both visual and textual information when making predictions.\n\n5. Attention Mask:\n   - A seq2seq attention mask is applied such that the text token only depends on the preceding tokens and all image tokens. This is a crucial part of the transformer architecture that enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating each token in the output sequence.\n\nFor any specific details regarding the tokenization method, vocabulary constraints (such as the use of a trie structure to limit candidate tokens), or other preprocessing steps not explicitly mentioned in the provided references, [More Information Needed]."

    "answer": "The performance and behavior of the model `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` are influenced by several characteristics, including the domain and context of the data, the model's architecture, and the population subgroups represented in the training data. Based on the provided references, the following points can be highlighted:\n\n1. **Pre-training Data Scale and Quality**: The model benefits from pre-training on a large dataset (0.8B image-text pairs), which includes diverse sources such as COCO, Conceptual Captions, SBU, Visual Genome, and others. However, the quality of the data is crucial, as performance drops were observed with the 0.8B data compared to the more curated 14M dataset, which is more similar to COCO. This suggests that the model may perform better on data similar to the higher-quality subsets of its pre-training data.\n\n2. **Model Capacity**: The base model has limited capacity and may not effectively benefit from large-scale, noisy data. This indicates that the model might perform better on tasks that are closer to the data it was effectively trained on, and it may struggle with very large and diverse datasets.\n\n3. **Bias and Fairness**: The normalized performance difference (NPD) was used to measure bias across gender in the dataset, with biases ranging from 0.7% to 5.3%. This suggests that while the model does exhibit some bias, it is relatively low. However, it is important to consider other demographic and intersectional factors that were not mentioned in the references to fully understand the model's fairness.\n\n4. **Task Complexity**: The model's text decoder has a more challenging task of organizing object terms in natural language, which might follow similar patterns and thus may not show improvement with a larger decoder. This could mean that the model is better suited for tasks with structured language patterns and may struggle with more complex or varied linguistic expressions.\n\n5. **Domain-Specific Performance**: The model has demonstrated strong capabilities in recognizing and describing scene text, indicating that it has encoded rich multi-modal knowledge about the visual world. However, its performance on specific domains like scene text recognition, image classification, and other benchmarks may vary, and it has established new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks like TextCaps.\n\n6. **Generalization and Adaptation**: The model's ability to adapt to specific tasks like scene text recognition suggests that it can generalize well to related tasks, but the performance on unrelated tasks or domains not represented in the training data may be less predictable.\n\nIn conclusion, the `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` model's behavior will be influenced by the quality and domain of its pre-training data, its capacity limitations, potential biases in the data, the complexity of the tasks it is applied to, and its ability to generalize and adapt to specific domains. Evaluation disaggregated across factors such as data quality, task complexity, and population subgroups is necessary to uncover disparities in performance and ensure the model's equitable application across different contexts."

    "answer": "For the evaluation of the model `microsoft/git-base-textvqa`, the following metrics will be used:\n\n1. **Accuracy**: As mentioned in reference 8, accuracy is a key metric, with the TextCaps-fine-tuned captioning model achieving an 89.9% accuracy rate. This metric is straightforward and will be used to measure the percentage of correct answers the model provides.\n\n2. **CIDEr Score**: Reference 5 indicates that CIDEr (Consensus-based Image Description Evaluation) is used for evaluating the performance of the model on datasets like TextCaps. The CIDEr score measures the consensus between a candidate's image description and a set of reference descriptions written by humans. Our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) and even human performance on TextCaps as per the CIDEr score.\n\n3. **Zero/Few-Shot Evaluation**: As per reference 5, the model's ability to perform with zero or few examples (shots) is also evaluated. This is important for understanding how well the model can generalize to new data or tasks with minimal additional training.\n\nThe tradeoffs between different errors are acknowledged in reference 7, where it is mentioned that the generative approach requires the model to predict at least two correct tokens (the answer and [EOS]), which can be more challenging than the discriminative approach that only requires one correct prediction. This might lead to slightly worse performance on some benchmarks like VQAv2, but the generative approach is chosen for its benefit of free-form answers.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation of `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` will focus on accuracy, CIDEr score, and zero/few-shot learning capabilities, while also considering the tradeoffs inherent in using a generative model for free-form answer prediction."

    "answer": "The evaluation results for the model `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` indicate that it has achieved impressive performance across various benchmarks. The model has been fine-tuned on TextCaps and demonstrates a strong capability in recognizing and describing scene text, as well as other visual elements such as tables, charts, food, banknotes, logos, landmarks, characters, celebrities, and products. This suggests that the model has encoded a rich multi-modal knowledge about the visual world.\n\nSpecifically, the model has outperformed the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) on TextCaps by a significant margin, achieving a CIDEr score of 138.2, which surpasses human performance (125.5 in CIDEr). Additionally, the model benefits from scaling up the pre-training data and model size, which has led to new state-of-the-art results on numerous challenging benchmarks.\n\nThe model utilizes a generative approach, which may contribute to its strong performance, as it requires at least two correct predictions (the answer and [EOS]) for each correct answer, compared to only one correct prediction for discriminative models. The use of RoBERTa as the text encoder is also mentioned as a factor that could implicitly improve performance by leveraging text-only data.\n\nVisual samples with the model fine-tuned on TextCaps (GIT TextCaps) show that it can recognize scene text almost as well as when fine-tuned on MJ+ST (GIT MJSJ), but in a natural language form. The model's simple approach, combined with the scaled-up pre-training data and model size, has led to surprisingly impressive performance without the need for complex techniques or ensembles.\n\nIn summary, the `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` model has established new state-of-the-art performance on TextCaps and other benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generative visual question answering tasks and scene text recognition."

    "answer": "### Model Card for microsoft/git-base-textvqa\n\n#### Explainability/Interpretability\n\nOur model, `microsoft/git-base-textvqa`, has been designed to tackle the challenges of Text-based Visual Question Answering (TextVQA) by leveraging rich multi-modal knowledge about the visual world. The model's architecture is informed by the empirical findings that scaling up the pre-training data and the model size can lead to significant improvements in performance.\n\n**Scaling and Performance:**\nWe observed that scaling the image encoder positively impacts the model's ability to recognize and describe various elements within an image, such as scene text, tables, charts, and other objects (Reference 1). However, scaling the text decoder did not show a similar improvement, which might be due to the limited amount of text available for language modeling and the nature of the task, which often involves organizing object terms in a patterned natural language way (Reference 2).\n\n**Bias and Fairness:**\nIn our efforts to understand and mitigate bias within our model, we followed the approach outlined by Zhao et al. (2021) to evaluate the model's performance across different gender and skin types. By calculating the Normalized Performance Difference (NPD), we found that the bias in our model ranges from 0.7% to 5.3% across all metrics, indicating a relatively low level of bias (Reference 5).\n\n**Generative Capabilities:**\nFor visual question answering, our model adopts a generative approach, concatenating the question and the ground-truth answer as a special caption during fine-tuning. The model is trained to generate answers without pre-defining candidate answers, which poses additional challenges but also allows for more flexible and natural responses (Reference 7).\n\n**Visualizations and Interpretability:**\nWe provide visual samples demonstrating the model's capabilities, such as the recognition of scene text in various contexts. These visualizations help in understanding how the model processes and interprets visual information to generate accurate and contextually relevant captions and answers (Reference 8).\n\nIn conclusion, the `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` model represents a step forward in TextVQA tasks, with a focus on scaling, bias mitigation, generative answering, and interpretability. While the model shows impressive capabilities, we acknowledge that there is always room for improvement, particularly in terms of explainability and reducing bias further. We are committed to ongoing research in these areas to enhance the model's performance and fairness.\n\n[More Information Needed] on specific methods or techniques used for explainability/interpretability beyond what has been discussed, as they are not detailed in the provided references."

    "answer": "The model `microsoft/git-base-textvqa` is a Generative Image-to-text Transformer (GIT) designed to unify vision-language tasks such as image/video captioning and question answering. The architecture of GIT simplifies the network by using one image encoder and one text decoder under a single language modeling task, as opposed to existing work that often relies on complex structures and external modules like object detectors and OCR.\n\nThe image encoder is based on a contrastive pre-trained model, specifically CLIP/ViT-B/16, which takes raw images as input and outputs a compact 2D feature map. This feature map is then flattened into a list of features, which are projected into D dimensions through an additional linear layer and a layernorm layer, to serve as input to the text decoder.\n\nThe text decoder is a transformer network, enlarged to 0.3B parameters, with hyperparameters following BERT-Large. It is responsible for generating text in an auto-regressive manner, starting with a [BOS] token and continuing until an [EOS] token is produced or a maximum step count is reached. The text is tokenized and embedded into D dimensions, with positional encoding and a layernorm layer added before being concatenated with the image features for input into the transformer module.\n\nThe model is pre-trained on image-text pairs and is capable of handling both image and video tasks without the need for task-specific encoders. For video tasks, features from multiple sampled frames are concatenated to form the video representation. In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA), the input question is treated as a text prefix, and the model generates the answer auto-regressively.\n\nThe pre-training of GIT involves a warm-up of the learning rate in the first 500 iterations, followed by a cosine decay to zero. The learning rate is set at 1e-5 for the image encoder and is multiplied by 5 for the text decoder, which is randomly initialized.\n\nOverall, the GIT model aims to establish new state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, including surpassing human performance on the TextCaps dataset, and introduces a new generation-based scheme for tasks like image classification and scene text recognition."
