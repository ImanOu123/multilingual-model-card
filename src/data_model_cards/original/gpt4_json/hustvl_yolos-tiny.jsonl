The parameters are initialized with a truncated normal distribution and optimized using AdamW. The learning rate is set to 1x10^-3, and the batch size is 1024, with cosine learning rate decay and a weight decay of 0.05. Data augmentation techniques such as Rand-Augment and random erasing are employed.\n- Fine-tuning: The model is fine-tuned on the COCO object detection benchmark. All parameters are initialized from ImageNet-1k pre-trained weights except for the MLP heads and [DET] tokens, which are randomly initialized. Training is performed on a single node with 8x12G GPUs, with a learning rate of 2.5x10^-5, a batch size of 8, cosine learning rate decay, and weight decay.\n\n### Parameters:\n- The model uses ImageNet-1k pre-trained weights for initialization, except for the newly introduced components for object detection, which are randomly initialized.\n- The input resolution for tiny models during inference is 512 for the shorter side.\n\n### Important Disclaimers:\n- The YOLOS design is not aimed at achieving the best detection performance but rather to explore the capabilities of Transformers in object detection with minimal biases.\n- The tiny-sized YOLOS model demonstrates impressive performance compared to tiny-sized CNN detectors, showing promise as a starting point for model scaling.\n- The model's versatility and transferability from image recognition to object detection are highlighted, with minimal knowledge about the input spatial structure.\n- [More Information Needed] for any additional disclaimers not covered by the provided references.\n\n### Contact Information:\n- For updates or inquiries regarding the model card, please contact the project organizer (the role you are assuming in this scenario).\n\n(Note: The above model card description is based on the provided references and may require additional details or updates based on the latest information available on the Huggingface model repository or from the model development team.)"

The references provided do not include explicit instructions for using the `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model without fine-tuning, post-processing, or plugging it into a pipeline. However, they do provide general information about how YOLOS models are trained and evaluated.\n\nTo use `hustvl/yolos-tiny` without fine-tuning, you would typically load the pre-trained model and run inference directly on your images. Since there is no direct code snippet provided for `hustvl/yolos-tiny` in the references, and the references focus on fine-tuning and evaluation, I cannot provide a specific code snippet for using `hustvl/yolos-tiny` without fine-tuning.\n\nHowever, if the model is available on HuggingFace Transformers as mentioned in the TL;DR section, you would generally use the Transformers library to load the model and perform inference. The code would look something like this:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForObjectDetection, AutoFeatureExtractor\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\n# Load the feature extractor and model from HuggingFace\nfeature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"hustvl/yolos-tiny\")\nmodel = AutoModelForObjectDetection.from_pretrained(\"hustvl/yolos-tiny\")\n\n# Load an image from the web\nurl = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\n# Preprocess the image and make predictions\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# The model outputs raw logits, which you would typically post-process to obtain bounding boxes and labels\n# However, since the question specifies no post-processing, we stop here\n# [More Information Needed] for details on how to interpret the raw logits without post-processing\n```\n\nPlease note that the above code is a general example of how you might use a model from the HuggingFace Transformers library for inference.

When fine-tuned on the COCO object detection benchmark, this model can be used for detecting and localizing objects within images across a wide range of categories.\n\nIn a larger ecosystem or application, `hustvl/yolos-tiny` can serve as a component for various tasks that require object detection capabilities. For instance, it can be integrated into surveillance systems for real-time object tracking, used in retail to analyze customer interactions with products, or implemented in autonomous vehicles for obstacle detection.\n\nThe model's small size makes it suitable for applications where computational resources are limited, such as on mobile devices or edge computing platforms.

    "question": "bias_risks_limitations",
    "chain": "generation",
    "answer": "The known or foreseeable issues stemming from the model hustvl/yolos-tiny can be categorized into technical limitations and sociotechnical considerations:\n\n**Technical Limitations:**\n\n1. **Transfer Learning Efficiency**: As mentioned in reference 1, YOLOS requires 150 epochs of transfer learning to adapt a pre-trained ViT for object detection, which indicates a significant computational cost and time investment for fine-tuning the model to specific tasks.\n\n2. **Model Size and Positional Encodings (PEs)**: Reference 2 highlights that about one-third of the model weights are dedicated to providing positional information, which may be seen as inefficient. Although the randomly initialized intermediate PEs do not introduce additional inductive biases, they do require learning positional relations from scratch, which could be computationally expensive.\n\n3. **Lack of Few-shot or Zero-shot Learning**: Unlike state-of-the-art language models that can adapt to new scenarios with little to no labeled data, as stated in reference 3, YOLOS still requires substantial supervision to transfer to downstream tasks, limiting its flexibility and ease of deployment in new domains.\n\n4. **PEs in Tiny-sized Models**: Reference 4 suggests that using a large enough PE in the first layer might make intermediate PEs redundant. This is an area that requires further research, and the current instantiation may not be optimal.\n\n5. **Model Scaling and Parameter Efficiency**: Reference 5 discusses the trade-offs in controlling model size and parameter efficiency, indicating that there may be a balance to strike between model complexity and computational resources.\n\n**Sociotechnical Considerations:**\n\n1. **Potential for Misunderstanding**: Reference 11 indicates that the performance of YOLOS may seem discouraging, but it is designed to reveal the transferability of ViT in object detection. Users may misunderstand the purpose of the model, expecting state-of-the-art performance rather than a demonstration of ViT's adaptability.\n\n2. **Bias and Fairness**: [More Information Needed] - The references do not provide explicit information on biases in the dataset or model fairness, but it is a common issue in deep learning models that must be considered, especially in object detection tasks.\n\n3. **Ethical Use and Misuse**: [More Information Needed] - The references do not discuss the ethical implications of using the model. However, as with any object detection technology, there is potential for misuse, such as surveillance without consent or in violation of privacy rights.\n\n4. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: [More Information Needed] - There is no information provided on how accessible the model is for users with varying levels of expertise or how inclusive it is in terms of recognizing diverse objects and scenarios.\n\n5. **Environmental Impact**: The computational cost mentioned in reference 1 implies a significant energy expenditure for training and fine-tuning the model, which has environmental implications.\n\nIn summary, while the hustvl/yolos-tiny model demonstrates the potential of Transformer-based models in object detection, it comes with technical limitations that affect its efficiency and adaptability. Additionally, there are broader sociotechnical issues that need to be addressed, such as potential misuse, bias, and environmental impact, for which more information is needed to fully assess."

    "question": "bias_recommendations",
    "chain": "generation",
    "answer": "Based on the provided references, here are the recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model hustvl/yolos-tiny:\n\n1. **Transfer Learning Efficiency**: The YOLOS model requires 150 epochs of transfer learning to adapt a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to perform object detection (Ref. 1). This indicates a significant computational cost for adaptation. It is recommended to explore methods to reduce the number of epochs required for transfer learning, possibly by investigating more efficient fine-tuning techniques or by leveraging more targeted pre-training.\n\n2. **Supervision Requirement**: Unlike state-of-the-art language models that can perform few-shot or zero-shot learning, YOLOS and other pre-trained computer vision models still require substantial supervision to transfer to downstream tasks (Ref. 2). It is recommended to investigate strategies to reduce the supervision needed, such as semi-supervised or unsupervised learning approaches that could leverage unlabeled data more effectively.\n\n3. **Positional Encoding (PE) Optimization**: The model uses a large PE in the first layer, which is a promising setting that will be studied more in the future (Ref. 3). It is recommended to continue research on optimizing PEs, especially considering the trade-off between model size and the ability to handle multi-scale inputs or inputs with varying sizes and aspect ratios (Ref. 5).\n\n4. **Model Size and Efficiency**: The YOLOS-Ti model is competitive in terms of average precision (AP), floating-point operations per second (FLOPs), and frames per second (FPS) when compared to tiny-sized CNN detectors (Ref. 6). However, it is noted that about one-third of the model weights are dedicated to providing positional information (Ref. 5). It is recommended to explore ways to reduce the model size without compromising performance, possibly by investigating more parameter-efficient positional encoding methods or model pruning techniques.\n\n5. **Interpretation of Results**: The YOLOS model is not designed for peak performance but rather to reveal the characteristics of the Transformer family in object detection (Ref. 7, 8). It is important to communicate this clearly to potential users, emphasizing that the model serves as a research tool to understand transferability and that there may be better-performing models for practical applications.\n\n6. **Ethical and Societal Considerations**: As a sociotechnic, it is crucial to consider the broader implications of deploying object detection models like YOLOS-Ti. This includes addressing potential biases in the training data, ensuring privacy and ethical use of the technology, and being transparent about the model's limitations. It is recommended to conduct thorough bias and fairness assessments and to provide clear guidelines for ethical usage.\n\nIn summary, while the YOLOS-Ti model shows promise, there are several areas for improvement, particularly in terms of transfer learning efficiency, supervision requirements, model size optimization, and ethical considerations. Further research and development are needed to address these issues."

    "answer": "The preprocessing steps for the data used in the `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model involve several key stages, as can be inferred from the provided references:\n\n1. **Image Resizing and Patch Extraction**: As per reference 5 and 7, input images are first resized such that the shortest side is at least 480 pixels and at most 800 pixels, while the longest side is at most 1333 pixels. The images are then reshaped into a sequence of flattened 2D image patches (`x_PATCH`). The resolution of each image patch is `(P, P)`, and the number of patches `N` is determined by the formula `N = HW / P^2`, where `H` and `W` are the height and width of the resized image, and `C` is the number of input channels.\n\n2. **Tokenization**: Reference 1 describes the tokenization process where the image patches are projected to `D` dimensions with a trainable linear projection (`E`). These projected patches are referred to as `[PATCH]` tokens. Additionally, one hundred randomly initialized learnable `[DET]` tokens are appended to the `[PATCH]` tokens to serve as proxies for object representations.\n\n3. **Position Embeddings**: Position embeddings are added to all input tokens to retain positional information, following the standard learnable 1D position embeddings as mentioned in reference 1.\n\n4. **Data Augmentation**: During training, random crop augmentations are applied as stated in reference 7. Additionally, reference 8 mentions the use of Rand-Augment and random erasing for data augmentation during the pre-training phase on the ImageNet-1k dataset.\n\n5. **Normalization and Other Preprocessing Steps**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided references, it is common practice in deep learning models to normalize the image data before feeding it into the network.

    "question": "testing_factors",
    "chain": "generation",
    "answer": "The foreseeable characteristics that will influence how the model hustvl/yolos-tiny behaves are as follows:\n\n1. **Model Design and Architecture**: YOLOS-Ti closely follows the original Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture and is optimized for object detection. The design is intentionally simple and not aimed at achieving the best detection performance but to reveal the characteristics of the Transformer family in object detection (Reference 6). This means that the model's behavior is influenced by the inherent properties of Transformers, such as their ability to handle sequential data and their requirement for large amounts of data to generalize well.\n\n2. **Performance Sensitivity**: The model's object detection results are sensitive to the pre-training scheme, indicating that the choice of pre-training strategy can significantly influence the model's performance (Reference 7). This suggests that the domain and context in which the model is pre-trained will affect its subsequent behavior in object detection tasks.\n\n3. **Detection Token Specialization**: The [DET] tokens used by YOLOS-Ti to represent detected objects are sensitive to object locations and sizes but are insensitive to object categories (Reference 2). This characteristic implies that the model may behave differently across various population subgroups that are defined by the size and location of objects within images.\n\n4. **Transferability of ViT**: The model is designed to reveal the transferability of ViT in object detection, which was originally developed for NLP tasks (Reference 3). The transferability aspect may influence the model's behavior when detecting objects that do not align well with the patterns learned from NLP-focused architectures.\n\n5. **Fine-Tuning on COCO Benchmark**: The model is fine-tuned on the COCO object detection benchmark, which means its behavior will be influenced by the distribution of objects and scenarios present in this dataset (Reference 8). If the COCO dataset has biases or lacks representation for certain subgroups or scenarios, this will likely be reflected in the model's performance.\n\n6. **Comparison with Other Models**: YOLOS-Ti is competitive in terms of average precision (AP), FLOPs, and frames per second (FPS) when compared with other tiny-sized CNN detectors, suggesting that it can serve as a promising model scaling start point (Reference 1). However, disparities in performance may still exist when compared to more complex or differently optimized models.\n\n7. **Hardware and Inference Speed**: The FPS data is measured on a single 1080Ti GPU, which indicates that the model's behavior in terms of inference speed is influenced by the hardware used (Reference 4). This could lead to disparities in performance across different deployment environments with varying hardware capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the behavior of hustvl/yolos-tiny is influenced by its Transformer-based design, pre-training schemes, specialization of detection tokens, the COCO benchmark dataset, and the hardware used for inference. To uncover disparities in performance, evaluation should be disaggregated across factors such as object size and location, pre-training data domains, and hardware environments."

AP provides a balance between precision and recall, and it is particularly relevant for the COCO benchmark which is mentioned in the references.\n\nAdditionally, the model will be evaluated based on its computational efficiency, which includes FLOPs (Floating Point Operations Per Second) and FPS (Frames Per Second). These metrics are important for understanding the trade-offs between the model's accuracy and its speed or resource consumption. FLOPs give an indication of the computational complexity of the model, while FPS measures how fast the model can process images, which is crucial for real-time applications.\n\nThe references also suggest that the model's design is not optimized for performance but rather to reveal the transferability of the Vision Transformer (ViT) to object detection tasks.

Pre-training and Fine-tuning: The model was pre-trained for 300 epochs on ImageNet-1k and fine-tuned on COCO for 150 epochs. During inference, the input shorter size is set to 512 for tiny models like `hustvl/yolos-tiny`.\n\n2.

    "answer": "## Model Card for hustvl/yolos-tiny\n\n### Experimental Section: Explainability/Interpretability\n\nThe hustvl/yolos-tiny model is a compact version of the YOLOS (You Only Look One-level Series) model family, which is designed to adapt the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for object detection tasks. In this section, we delve into the explainability and interpretability aspects of the YOLOS-Tiny model.\n\n#### Attention Visualization\n\nTo understand how the model makes predictions, we have studied the self-attention mechanisms within the YOLOS-Tiny model. By visualizing the attention maps, we can observe that different self-attention heads focus on various patterns and locations across the input image. These visualizations can be both interpretable and non-interpretable, providing insights into the model's focus areas during detection.\n\nFor instance, we have compared the attention maps of two YOLOS models pre-trained on ImageNet-1k for different epochs but achieving the same average precision (AP). The visualizations suggest that even with the same AP, the models may attend to different features or regions for a given predicted object.\n\n#### Self-Attention of [DET] Tokens\n\nThe [DET] tokens, which are crucial for object detection in YOLOS models, have been specifically inspected for their self-attention patterns. By following the visualization pipeline from Caron et al., we have generated visual results that help us conclude the behavior of these tokens in the context of object detection.\n\n#### Correlation Study\n\nWe have conducted a study to measure the linear correlation between the proximity of [DET] tokens (in terms of cosine similarity) and their corresponding predictions' proximity (in terms of Euclidean distance). The result, with a correlation coefficient of \u03c1 X,Y = \u22120.80, indicates a strong inverse relationship, suggesting that [DET] tokens closer to each other tend to predict objects that are also nearby in the image.\n\n#### Model Design and Performance\n\nThe YOLOS-Tiny model is intentionally designed to be simple, closely following the original ViT architecture. This design choice is not aimed at optimizing detection performance but rather at revealing the characteristics and transferability of Transformer models in object detection tasks. Despite this, YOLOS-Tiny demonstrates impressive performance when compared to tiny-sized CNN detectors, being strong in AP and competitive in terms of FLOPs and FPS.\n\n#### Interpreting the Results\n\nThe results obtained from YOLOS-Tiny should be interpreted with the understanding that the model is not optimized for peak performance. Instead, it serves as a proof of concept for the application of ViT in object detection and as a starting point for model scaling within the Transformer family.\n\nIn summary, the YOLOS-Tiny model provides valuable insights into the application of Transformer architectures in computer vision, particularly in object detection. Its design allows for the study of explainability and interpretability within this domain, contributing to the broader understanding of how such models perceive and process visual information."

    "answer": "The model architecture of `hustvl/yolos-tiny` (YOLOS-Ti) is based on the vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with minimal modifications to adapt it for the task of object detection. The key characteristics of the YOLOS-Ti architecture are as follows:\n\n1. **Detector Heads**: YOLOS-Ti simplifies the detector head compared to traditional object detection models. It uses a single multilayer perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers and ReLU activation functions for both classification and bounding box regression tasks.\n\n2. **Inductive Bias**: The architecture is designed with minimal additional inductive biases. The inductive biases that are inherent from ViT include patch extraction at the network stem and resolution adjustment for position embeddings. YOLOS-Ti does not add any non-degenerate convolutions (e.g., 3x3) on top of the ViT architecture.\n\n3. **[DET] Tokens**: Instead of using a [CLS] token as in image classification tasks, YOLOS-Ti uses one hundred [DET] tokens for object detection. These tokens serve as proxies for object representations, following a similar approach to DETR (DEtection TRansformer).\n\n4. **Position Embedding (PE)**: Due to variations in image resolutions and aspect ratios in object detection tasks, YOLOS-Ti adapts the position embedding from ViT to accommodate these changes, which could affect the model size and performance.\n\n5. **Model Design**: YOLOS-Ti closely follows the original ViT architecture and is optimized for object detection. It is designed to be easily adapted to various Transformer architectures and to reveal the characteristics of the Transformer family in object detection tasks.\n\n6. **Objective**: The objective of YOLOS-Ti is to perform 2D object detection from a pure sequence-to-sequence perspective with minimal knowledge about the 2D spatial structure. It uses a bipartite matching loss for set prediction, following the approach by Carion et al., to perform object detection without manually injecting heuristics or prior knowledge of object spatial structure.\n\n7. **Performance**: Despite not being designed to optimize for detection performance, YOLOS-Ti achieves impressive performance compared to tiny-sized CNN detectors, being strong in average precision (AP) and competitive in FLOPs & FPS.\n\nIn summary, `hustvl/yolos-tiny` is a compact and efficient object detection model that leverages the strengths of the Vision Transformer architecture with a focus on simplicity and minimal inductive biases. It demonstrates the potential of Transformers in computer vision tasks, particularly object detection, without relying on complex and task-specific architectural modifications."
