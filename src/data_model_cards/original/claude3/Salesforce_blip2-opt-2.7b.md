## Model Details

### Model Description

Model Card for Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b

Model Architecture:
- BLIP-2 is a vision-language pre-training method that bootstraps from frozen pre-trained unimodal models.
- It uses a Querying Transformer (Q-Former) to bridge the modality gap between vision and language.
- Q-Former is connected to a frozen image encoder (e.g., ViT-L/14) and a frozen language model (e.g., OPT-2.7B).
- The Q-Former uses 32 queries, each with a dimension of 768, to extract visual information relevant to the text.

Training Procedures:
- BLIP-2 is pre-trained in two stages:
  1. Vision-language representation learning stage with a frozen image encoder.
  2. Vision-to-language generative learning stage with a frozen language model.
- In the first stage, the model is trained from scratch using the following command:
  ```bash run_scripts/blip2/train/pretrain_stage1.sh```
- In the second stage, the model is further pre-trained using the following command:
  ```bash run_scripts/blip2/train/pretrain_stage2.sh```
- The model is fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as image captioning, using task-specific scripts (e.g., ```bash run_scripts/blip2/train/train_caption_coco.sh```).
- The pre-training uses AdamW optimizer with specific hyperparameters, a cosine learning rate decay, and data augmentation techniques.

Parameters:
- BLIP-2 has significantly fewer trainable parameters compared to existing methods.
- The exact number of parameters for the Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b variant is [More Information Needed].
- During pre-training, the frozen models' parameters are converted to FP16 or BFloat16 for computational efficiency.

#### Factors

Based on the provided references about the Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b model, here are some foreseeable characteristics that may influence the model's behavior:

1. Domain and context: The model's performance may vary across different image domains and contexts. For example, the model may have better accuracy on common objects and scenes it was trained on, compared to rare or novel visual concepts. The model's knowledge cutoff date can also impact its ability to reason about new image content.

2. Population subgroups: As mentioned in reference 1, the model inherits risks of the underlying language model, which could propagate social biases. This suggests the model's outputs may exhibit disparities or biases when analyzing images depicting different demographic groups. Disaggregated evaluation across population subgroups would be needed to uncover such biases.

## Model Examination

Here is my attempt at an experimental section on explainability/interpretability for the Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b model:

The BLIP-2 model achieves strong zero-shot performance on various vision-language tasks by effectively combining a frozen image encoder with a frozen language model. This allows the model to understand images while preserving its capability to follow text prompts and instructions.

However, the model can still produce unsatisfactory or inaccurate image-to-text generation in some cases. This may be due to:
- The language model outputting incorrect knowledge 
- Activating an incorrect reasoning path for the given image
- Lacking up-to-date information about new visual concepts

Furthermore, by using frozen pretrained components, BLIP-2 inherits some risks of large language models, such as potentially generating offensive language, propagating social biases, or leaking private information.

[More Information Needed] on specific techniques to analyze what features or reasoning paths the BLIP-2 model uses to generate text for a given image. Visualizing the model's attention weights or most activated neurons could provide insights into its decision process.

Potential remediation approaches to improve the model's outputs include:
- Using instructions to better guide the model's generation 
- [More Information Needed] on other techniques

In summary, while BLIP-2 demonstrates impressive zero-shot capabilities, more work is needed to fully understand and explain its reasoning process from image to generated text. Improved interpretability could help identify failure modes and mitigate risks inherited from the underlying frozen models.

## Environmental Impact

## Technical Specification

### Model Architecture and Objective

Model Architecture:
BLIP-2 consists of a frozen image encoder, a trainable Q-Former module, and a frozen language model (LLM). The Q-Former bridges the gap between the frozen image encoder and LLM. It has two transformer submodules that share the same self-attention layers: (1) an image transformer that interacts with the frozen image encoder for visual feature extraction, and (2) a text transformer that can function as both a text encoder and a text decoder.

The Q-Former extracts a fixed number of output features (queries) from the image encoder, independent of input image resolution. In the experiments, 32 queries are used, where each query has a dimension of 768 (same as the hidden dimension of the Q-Former). The output query representation (denoted as Z) has a size of 32 Ã— 768, which is much smaller than the size of frozen image features.

Objectives:
BLIP-2 is pre-trained using image-text pairs with three objectives that share the same input format and model parameters:

1. Image-Text Contrastive Learning (ITC): Computes the pairwise similarity between each query output and the text representation, and selects the highest one as the image-text similarity. A unimodal self-attention mask is employed to avoid information leak between queries and text.

2. Image-Text Matching (ITM): A binary classification task that predicts whether an image-text pair is positive (matched) or negative (unmatched). A bi-directional self-attention mask is used where all queries and texts can attend to each other. Each output query embedding is fed into a two-class linear classifier to obtain a logit.

3. [More Information Needed]

These objectives work together to force the queries to extract visual information that is most relevant to the text. The pre-training aims to train the Q-Former such that the queries can learn to extract visual representation that is most informative of the text.

Sample Code:
```python
processor = Blip2Processor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b")
model = Blip2ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b", load_in_8bit=True, device_map="auto")
```
