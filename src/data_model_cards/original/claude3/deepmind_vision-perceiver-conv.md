### Out-of-Scope Use

Based on the provided references about the deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model, here are some potential ways the model could foreseeably be misused and what users ought not do:

The model should not be used for surveillance, tracking or identifying individuals without consent, as this would be unethical and likely illegal in many jurisdictions. The powerful visual understanding capabilities could enable invasive monitoring if misused.

Users should not rely solely on the model's outputs for high-stakes decisions that impact people's lives, rights or access to opportunities. More human oversight and additional decision support tools are needed, as the model may have biases or make mistakes.

The model should not be applied for deepfakes, misinformation generation, or other deceptive and misleading content creation. Synthesizing realistic video, images or audio has risks of enabling fraud and manipulation.

[More Information Needed] on specific technical ways the model architecture or training data could be exploited by bad actors to cause harm. The references do not go into enough detail to assess this.

In general, the transformative AI capabilities of large general-purpose perception models like this require proactively considering misuse risks and providing clear usage guidelines to mitigate potential societal harms. Ongoing monitoring and refinement of these guidelines is prudent as the technology evolves.

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations

Based on the provided references about the deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model, here are some potential issues and limitations:

This could lead to the model exhibiting biases or performing poorly on underrepresented data. [More Information Needed] on the exact biases and failure modes.
- Deploying the model in high-stakes domains like healthcare, security, etc. without extensive testing and human oversight could lead to harmful outcomes if the model makes mistakes. The limitations and failure modes need to be thoroughly characterized first.

Technical limitations: 
- The references mention the model was evaluated on several domains like language, vision, multi-modal and multi-task settings. However, [More Information Needed] on the exact performance metrics, generalization ability, robustness to distribution shift, compute efficiency, etc. More extensive benchmarking is required.
- [More Information Needed] on how the model compares to state-of-the-art models in each domain. The tradeoffs and benefits of using Perceiver IO architecture over specialized architectures for each modality is unclear.

Sociotechnical limitations:
- Deploying large general-purpose models like Perceiver IO could have unintended societal consequences in terms of fairness, privacy, energy usage, etc. that need to be studied further. [More Information Needed]
- The model card and documentation should clearly convey the intended use cases, limitations, potential failure modes and other considerations to help users make informed decisions. [More Information Needed] on these aspects currently.

In summary, while Perceiver IO is a promising general-purpose architecture, much more analysis is needed on its capabilities, limitations, potential harms and sociotechnical implications before responsibly deploying it in real-world applications. I would recommend conducting extensive studies to address the [More Information Needed] points mentioned above.

Video and Audio Preprocessing (for multimodal autoencoding experiments):
- Both video and audio inputs are patched
- Video patch size: 1 × 4 × 4
- Audio patch size: 16
- Audio is sampled at 48kHz (1920 samples per frame)
- Labels are embedded as one-hot vectors

Position Embeddings:
- For each input video patch, a 387-dimensional 3D Fourier position embedding is used
- For each audio patch, a 385-dimensional 1D Fourier position embedding is used
- Modality-specific learned vectors are padded to the input elements to represent the modality

Decoder Queries:
- Constructed from Fourier position embeddings for video (387 features) and audio (385 features)
- A learned positional embedding (1024 features) is used for the label
- Modality-specific learned vectors are padded to the queries, resulting in a final feature size of 1026

Other Factors:

#### Summary

Based on the provided references about the deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model, here is a summary of the evaluation results:

- Perceiver IO performs well on real-world data despite being trained only on synthetic imagery, as verified on a small number of real videos from Getty Images. It is able to capture the structure of both video and audio inputs. [Reference 1, 6]

- Perceiver IO was evaluated on several domains including language understanding (Wikipedia+C4 masked language modeling), visual understanding (Sintel/KITTI optical flow and ImageNet classification), multi-modal (Kinetics autoencoding and AudioSet classification) & multi-task settings (multi-task GLUE), and symbolic representations for games (StarCraft II). [Reference 2]

- On the Sintel optical flow benchmark, concatenating frames led to performance improvements, especially on the more difficult Sintel.final and KITTI Flow 2015 datasets. Convolutional downsampling and RAFT upsampling provide more spatial context. [Reference 7] 

- On ImageNet, Perceiver IO surpasses 80% top-1 accuracy (84.5% top-1) without using 2D convolutions after pretraining on JFT. It is competitive with members of the Vision Transformer (ViT) family. [Reference 4, 8]

## Model Examination

Based on the provided references about the deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model, here is what I can say about the model's explainability and interpretability:

The model uses convolutional pre-processing to inject information about the 2D structure of images into the architecture (Reference 3). This helps the model better understand and process visual inputs compared to the original Perceiver model.

To visualize what the model has learned, a Colab notebook is provided to run a pre-trained video autoencoding Perceiver IO model and visualize the video reconstructions (Reference 1). This gives some insight into the model's learned representations for video data.

[More Information Needed] on other specific techniques used to analyze or visualize the learned features of the deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model. Reference 5 mentions "analysis and visualization of the learnt features" for a language model variant, but no code or details are provided here that are directly relevant to deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv.

In summary, the convolutional processing and ability to visualize reconstructions provide some tools for understanding what the model has learned, but [More Information Needed] to give a more complete picture of the explainability and interpretability of deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv specifically. The provided references focus more on describing the model architecture and capabilities rather than interpretability.

## Technical Specification

### Model Architecture and Objective

Model Architecture:
The Perceiver IO architecture consists of an encoder, latent processing layers, and a decoder. The encoder maps input arrays to a latent space using attention. The latent arrays are then processed by a series of modules that apply attention and MLPs. Finally, the decoder maps the processed latents to output arrays using attention.

The encoder and decoder attention modules use query-key-value (QKV) attention followed by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Linear projection layers ensure inputs and outputs of the QKV attention and MLPs have the desired sizes.

For vision tasks, the model incorporates convolutional pre-processing to inject information about the 2D structure of images into the architecture. This can involve using a convolutional layer to downsample the input before feeding it into the Perceiver IO architecture.

Model Objective:
The objective of the deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model is to demonstrate the generality and flexibility of the Perceiver IO architecture across various domains, including visual understanding tasks like optical flow estimation and image classification.

By serving as a drop-in replacement for specialist networks in challenging domains while improving performance on tasks like classification, the model aims to showcase Perceiver IO's ability to handle diverse input and output representations with unprecedented levels of generality.
