## Training Details

### Training Data

The training data for the model facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic consists of high-resolution urban street-view images from the Cityscapes dataset, which includes 2975 images for training. The images are annotated with a total of 19 classes for semantic segmentation tasks. For detailed training settings and data preprocessing steps, please refer to the provided documentation on [Preparing Datasets for Mask2Former](datasets/README.md).

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps for the data used in the model `facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic` are not explicitly detailed in the provided references. However, we can infer some general practices typically involved in preparing data for semantic segmentation tasks, which may apply to this model:

1. **Tokenization**: This step is generally not applicable to semantic segmentation tasks as they deal with images, not text data. Semantic segmentation involves processing pixel data rather than tokens, which are units of text.

2. **Resizing/Rewriting**: For image data, resizing is a common preprocessing step. The references mention that the model operates on feature maps with resolutions of 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32 of the original image size, and there is an upsampling layer that generates a feature map of resolution 1/4 as the per-pixel embedding. This suggests that the input images are likely resized to create multi-scale feature maps that the model processes. However, the exact resizing dimensions or methods (e.g., bilinear, nearest-neighbor) are not specified in the references provided.

3. **Additional Preprocessing**: The model may include other preprocessing steps such as normalization of the pixel values, data augmentation (e.g., random cropping, flipping, scaling), and conversion of the image data into a format suitable for the model. These steps are standard in deep learning for computer vision but are not explicitly mentioned in the references.

4. **Post-processing**: Reference [4] mentions that the same post-processing as [14] is used to acquire the expected output format for panoptic and semantic segmentation from pairs of binary masks and class predictions. This indicates that after the model generates predictions, there is a post-processing step to format the output correctly, but the details of this step are not provided in the references.

Since the specific details of the preprocessing steps such as the exact resizing dimensions, normalization constants, or data augmentation techniques are not provided in the references, we would need more information to give a precise description of the preprocessing pipeline for the `facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic` model.

## Evaluation

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

The model facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic evaluates on the following benchmarks or datasets:

1. Cityscapes [16]
2. ADE20K [65]
3. Mapillary Vistas [42]
4. COCO [35] (for instance segmentation)
5. COCO panoptic [28] (for panoptic segmentation)

#### Factors

The model facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic is designed to be a universal image segmentation model, as suggested by its competitive performance on various datasets including Cityscapes, ADE20K, and Mapillary Vistas. However, there are several characteristics that could influence its behavior:

1. **Domain and Context**: The model has been trained on datasets that contain urban street scenes (Cityscapes), diverse everyday scenes (ADE20K), and street-level imagery across different cities (Mapillary Vistas). Its performance may be optimized for these types of images, and it might not generalize as well to domains with significantly different characteristics, such as rural landscapes, indoor scenes, or medical imagery.

2. **Population Subgroups**: The datasets used for training include a variety of "things" and "stuff" categories. However, if certain subgroups or categories are underrepresented in the training data, the model may perform worse on those. For instance, if the training data lacks diversity in weather conditions, the model might not perform as well on images with snow or fog compared to clear weather conditions.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The model's performance is measured using PQ (panoptic quality), AP (average precision), and mIoU (mean Intersection-over-Union). These metrics provide a general sense of the model's performance but may not capture all aspects of segmentation quality, such as fine-grained details or segmentation consistency across similar objects.

4. **Training Specificity**: According to the references, Mask2Former trained on panoptic segmentation only performs slightly worse than the same model trained with the corresponding annotations for instance and semantic segmentation tasks. This suggests that while the model can generalize across tasks, there is still a benefit to task-specific training. Therefore, the model's behavior may be influenced by the specificity of its training in relation to the task it is being applied to.

5. **Performance Disparities**: The evaluation of the model should ideally be disaggregated across factors such as object size, object density, and scene complexity to uncover any disparities in performance. Without this detailed evaluation, it is difficult to fully understand the model's behavior across different conditions and subgroups.

In summary, while the model shows promise as a universal image segmentation model, its behavior will likely be influenced by the domain and context of the images, the representation of population subgroups in the training data, the evaluation metrics used, the specificity of its training, and potential performance disparities that have not been fully uncovered due to a lack of disaggregated evaluation. Further analysis and testing would be required to identify and mitigate any biases or limitations in the model's performance.

#### Metrics

For the evaluation of the model `facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic`, the following metrics will be used:

1. **mIoU (mean Intersection-over-Union)**: This metric will be used for semantic segmentation. It measures the average overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth across all categories.

2. **AP (Average Precision)**: For instance segmentation, the standard AP metric will be used, which evaluates the precision of the model in detecting and delineating individual object instances.

3. **PQ (Panoptic Quality)**: Although not explicitly mentioned for the `facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic` model, PQ is generally used for panoptic segmentation, which combines both instance and semantic segmentation tasks. It is a comprehensive metric that takes into account both segmentation and detection performance.

The references indicate that the model is designed to work well across different segmentation tasks, and the metrics chosen reflect the tradeoffs between different errors in these tasks. For instance, while AP focuses on the precision of instance detection, mIoU assesses the overall accuracy of the semantic segmentation. PQ provides a holistic measure of performance across both tasks. The model's universality and performance across these metrics are highlighted, suggesting that it is capable of handling the tradeoffs between different types of segmentation errors effectively.

### Results

The Mask2Former model with a Swin-Large (Swin-L) backbone, specifically trained for the Cityscapes dataset, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image segmentation tasks. The evaluation results for the `facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic` model are based on several key metrics:

1. **Panoptic Segmentation**: The model uses the standard Panoptic Quality (PQ) metric for evaluation. The Mask2Former with Swin-L backbone outperforms the previous state-of-the-art Panoptic-DeepLab with SWideRnet using single-scale inference. However, the exact PQ score is not provided in the references.

2. **Semantic Segmentation**: For semantic segmentation, the model uses the mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) metric. The references indicate that the Mask2Former with a Swin-B backbone outperforms the state-of-the-art SegFormer. Although the exact mIoU score for the Swin-L backbone on the Cityscapes dataset is not explicitly mentioned, it is implied that the model achieves high performance in this task as well.

3. **Instance Segmentation**: The model's performance for instance segmentation is evaluated using the Average Precision (AP) metric. Specifically, the AP evaluated on the "thing" categories is reported as AP_Th_pan. However, the exact AP scores are not provided in the references.

4. **Model Generalization**: The Mask2Former model generalizes well beyond standard benchmarks, obtaining state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including Cityscapes. This suggests that the model is robust and versatile across different segmentation tasks.

5. **Training Settings**: For the Cityscapes dataset, the model uses 200 queries for panoptic and instance segmentation models with the Swin-L backbone. This is in contrast to other backbones or semantic segmentation models, which use 100 queries.

6. **Runtime Performance**: The runtime performance on a V100 GPU with a batch size of 1, including post-processing time, is reported. However, the exact runtime figures are not provided in the references.

In summary, the `facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic` model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cityscapes dataset across panoptic, semantic, and instance segmentation tasks. The model outperforms existing methods in panoptic and semantic segmentation without using extra data. However, for specific numerical evaluation results such as PQ, mIoU, and AP scores, [More Information Needed] as they are not detailed in the provided references.

#### Summary

The Mask2Former model with a Swin-Large (Swin-L) backbone, when evaluated on the Cityscapes dataset for semantic segmentation, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance. It outperforms previous leading methods, including Panoptic-DeepLab with SWideRnet backbone and SegFormer, across various metrics without the need for extra data.

Specifically, for panoptic segmentation, the Mask2Former with Swin-L backbone surpasses the Panoptic-DeepLab model using single-scale inference. In terms of semantic segmentation, the Mask2Former with Swin-B backbone exceeds the performance of the SegFormer model.

The model also shows high performance on two additional metrics: AP Th pan and mIoU pan. AP Th pan is the average precision evaluated on the "thing" categories using instance segmentation annotations, and mIoU pan is the mean Intersection-over-Union evaluated on the combined categories for semantic segmentation converted from panoptic segmentation annotations.

These results highlight the versatility of the Mask2Former model, as it is trained solely with panoptic segmentation annotations but can be effectively used for both instance and semantic segmentation tasks. This universality is a significant advantage of the Mask2Former architecture.

This model leverages the Mask2Former architecture with a Swin-L (Swin Large) backbone, which has shown exceptional performance across various segmentation tasks without the need for extra data.

## Explainability/Interpretability

Our team acknowledges the growing importance of model explainability and interpretability, especially in the context of complex tasks such as image segmentation. The Mask2Former model incorporates several design choices that contribute to its effectiveness and generalizability:

1. **Masked Attention**: The model utilizes a masked attention mechanism that has been validated to provide significant improvements across all segmentation tasks, particularly for instance and panoptic segmentation. This attention mechanism helps the model focus on relevant parts of the image, which can be crucial for understanding the model's decision-making process.

2. **Feature Resolution**: High-resolution features are beneficial for the Transformer decoder in Mask2Former, enhancing the model's ability to capture fine details. Our efficient multi-scale strategy allows the model to maintain high performance while reducing computational overhead, which can be a point of analysis for understanding the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.

3. **Pixel Decoder Compatibility**: Mask2Former's compatibility with various pixel decoders indicates its flexibility and adaptability. Different pixel decoders may specialize in different tasks, and understanding their specialization can provide insights into the model's performance on specific segmentation challenges.

4. **Generalization Across Tasks**: While Mask2Former excels in panoptic segmentation, it also performs competitively in instance and semantic segmentation tasks. This suggests that the model has learned a generalizable representation of image segmentation, which could be further explored to understand how it adapts to different segmentation contexts.

5. **Backbone and Query Configuration**: The choice of Swin-L backbone and the use of 200 queries for panoptic and instance segmentation models (compared to 100 for semantic segmentation models) are decisions that likely influence the model's performance. Investigating the impact of these configurations could shed light on the model's behavior and its ability to handle various segmentation tasks.

In future work, we aim to enhance the interpretability of the Mask2Former model by developing methods that can provide more granular insights into the model's decision-making process.

## Technical Specification

### Model Architecture and Objective

The model architecture for `facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic` is based on the Maskedattention Mask Transformer (Mask2Former) framework, which is designed to handle various image segmentation tasks, including panoptic, instance, and semantic segmentation. The key components of this architecture include:

1. **Pixel Decoder**: The model uses a multi-scale deformable attention Transformer (MSDeformAttn) as the default pixel decoder. It applies 6 MSDeformAttn layers to feature maps with resolutions of 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32. Additionally, it employs a simple upsampling layer with lateral connections on the final 1/8 feature map to generate a feature map of resolution 1/4 as the per-pixel embedding. This pixel decoder has been shown to provide the best results across different segmentation tasks.

2. **Transformer Decoder**: The Transformer decoder used in this model is a custom design with L = 3 (i.e., 9 layers in total) and 100 queries by default. An auxiliary loss is added to every intermediate Transformer decoder layer to improve training and performance.

3. **Masked Attention**: The architecture utilizes masked attention to extract localized features by constraining cross-attention within predicted mask regions. This approach is key to better convergence and results.

4. **Post-Processing**: The model follows the same post-processing steps as previous work to acquire the expected output format for panoptic and semantic segmentation from pairs of binary masks and class predictions. For instance segmentation, it requires additional confidence scores for each prediction, which are computed by multiplying class confidence and mask confidence.

5. **Loss Function**: The loss function used is a combination of binary cross-entropy loss and dice loss for the mask loss, with weights Î»_ce = 5.0 and Î»_dice = 5.0. The final loss is a combination of mask loss and classification loss, with Î»_cls = 2.0 for predictions matched with ground truth and 0.1 for "no object" predictions.

The objective of the `facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic` model is to perform semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset. Semantic segmentation involves grouping pixels with different semantics, such as category membership. The model aims to achieve high performance on this task, leveraging the advanced architecture of Mask2Former and the Swin-L backbone. It has been evaluated on multiple datasets and has set new state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling image segmentation tasks.

### Compute Infrastructure

The compute infrastructure used for training the model `facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic` involved the following specifications:

1. A V100 GPU was used for inference, with a batch size of 1, to measure the average runtime on the entire validation set, including post-processing time for semantic segmentation tasks.

2. For training, the models were trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 16.

3. The training utilized large-scale jittering (LSJ) augmentation with a random scale sampled from the range 0.1 to 2.0, followed by a fixed-size crop to 1024Ã—1024.

4. The inference settings followed the standard Mask R-CNN approach, where an image is resized with the shorter side to 800 and the longer side up to 1333.

5. The model's FLOPs were averaged over 100 validation images, and frames-per-second (fps) were measured, but the specific hardware used for this measurement is not mentioned in the provided references.

6. The model uses a Swin-L backbone for panoptic and instance segmentation models, which suggests that the training infrastructure needed to support the large memory consumption associated with high-resolution mask prediction.

7. The exact details of the training infrastructure, such as the number of GPUs used, the total memory available, or the distributed training setup (if any), are not provided in the references.

In summary, the model utilized a V100 GPU for inference and was trained with a batch size of 16 for 50 epochs using LSJ augmentation. However, more specific details about the complete training infrastructure are not provided in the references.
