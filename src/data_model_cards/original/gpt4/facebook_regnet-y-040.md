The model facebook/regnet-y-040 is a part of the RegNet family, which consists of simple, regular networks designed through a low-dimensional design space that emphasizes the importance of network width and depth. It outperforms models like EfficientNet in terms of accuracy and is significantly faster on GPUs, making it a powerful choice for visual recognition tasks.

## Model Details

### Model Description

Model Architecture:
The facebook/regnet-y-040 model is part of the RegNet family, which is designed to provide simple and fast networks that work well across a wide range of flop regimes. The architecture of RegNet models is characterized by a quantized linear function that explains the widths and depths of good networks. The RegNetY variant incorporates the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) operation, which has been shown to yield good performance gains. The model has a stable optimal depth of approximately 20 blocks (60 layers) across different flop regimes, and it uses a bottleneck ratio (b) of 1.0, effectively removing the bottleneck commonly used in practice. The width multiplier (w_m) is also an important parameter in the design of RegNet models.

Training Procedures:
The training of the facebook/regnet-y-040 model follows basic settings from prior work, with a learning rate (lr) of 0.1 and weight decay (wd) of 5•10^-5. The model is trained on the ImageNet dataset, and the training is conducted in a low-compute, low-epoch regime to maintain efficiency. The model is trained for 100 epochs on 8 GPUs with a specific batch size, and the learning rate is adjusted using the linear scaling rule with a 5 epoch gradual warmup.

Parameters:
The RegNet design space is defined by six parameters: depth (d), initial width (w_0), width slope (w_a), width multiplier (w_m), bottleneck ratio (b), and group width (g). For the facebook/regnet-y-040 model, these parameters are set to create a network structure that fits within the design space constraints, with d < 64, w_0, w_a < 256, and 1.5 ≤ w_m ≤ 3. The exact values for the facebook/regnet-y-040 model are not provided in the references, so [More Information Needed] for the specific parameter values.

Important Disclaimers:
The RegNet design space is more interpretable and can lead to insights that differ from current practices in network design. It is important to note that while the RegNet design space has been tested across different compute regimes and network block types, the results and performance may vary depending on the specific application and dataset. Additionally, the efficiency of the model is based on the assumption of standard model families and may not hold true for all possible network structures. Users should be aware of these considerations when applying the model to their specific tasks.

## Uses

### Direct Use

The `facebook/regnet-y-040` model is a pre-trained image classification model that is part of the RegNet family of models, which are designed to provide a good balance between computational efficiency and accuracy. This model has been trained on a large dataset (likely ImageNet, as is common for such models, though the provided references do not explicitly state this) and can be used for classifying images into a predefined set of categories without the need for further fine-tuning or post-processing.

To use the `facebook/regnet-y-040` model for image classification, you would typically load the pre-trained model and pass an image through it to obtain the predicted class probabilities. The model outputs a vector of probabilities, each corresponding to a different class label, and the class with the highest probability is taken as the prediction.

Here's a conceptual code snippet on how you might use the model in PyTorch, assuming that the model is available in the Hugging Face Model Hub or a similar repository. Note that actual code might differ slightly, and you would need to preprocess your input image to match the format expected by the model (e.g., resizing, normalization):

```python
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image
import torch
from huggingface_hub import from_pretrained

# Load the pre-trained RegNet model
model = from_pretrained('facebook/regnet-y-040')
model.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode

# Define the image transformations
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])

# Load an image
img = Image.open('path_to_your_image.jpg')
img = transform(img).unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dimension

# Make a prediction
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(img)
    _, predicted = outputs.max(1)

# The variable 'predicted' now contains the index of the highest probability class
```

Please note that the above code is a general example and might require adjustments to work with the specific `facebook/regnet-y-040` model. The actual model loading function (`from_pretrained`) and preprocessing steps should be consistent with the model's requirements, which are typically provided in the model's documentation or the codebase (`pycls`) mentioned in the references.

If the model is not directly available through a simple API call, you would need to follow the instructions provided in the `pycls` Model Zoo to download the pre-trained weights and load them into the model architecture defined in the `pycls` codebase. However, without a direct code block reference from the provided information, I cannot provide a specific code snippet for this process.

### Downstream Use

The `facebook/regnet-y-040` model is a part of the RegNet family of models, which are designed to be simple, fast, and effective across a wide range of computational regimes. This particular model can be fine-tuned for various visual recognition tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation when adapted to specific datasets.

When fine-tuning `facebook/regnet-y-040` for a specific task, users would typically follow these steps:

1. Load the pre-trained `facebook/regnet-y-040` model.
2. Replace the final classification layer with a new layer tailored to the number of classes in the target dataset.
3. Freeze the weights of the earlier layers to retain the learned features (optional, depending on the task and dataset size).
4. Train the model on the target dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate and weight decay based on the findings in the references, which suggest `lr = 0.1` and `wd = 5•10^-5`.

For integration into a larger ecosystem or app, `facebook/regnet-y-040` can serve as a feature extractor where the representations learned by the model are used as inputs for other machine learning models or systems. This is particularly useful in scenarios where computational resources are limited, as the model has been designed to be efficient.

Here is a conceptual code snippet for fine-tuning the model using PyTorch, assuming the model and the pre-trained weights are available through Huggingface's model hub:

```python
from transformers import RegNetForImageClassification
from transformers import RegNetConfig
import torch

# Load the pre-trained RegNet model
config = RegNetConfig.from_pretrained('facebook/regnet-y-040')
model = RegNetForImageClassification.from_pretrained('facebook/regnet-y-040', config=config)

# Replace the head of the model with a new classifier
num_labels = 100  # Example for a dataset with 100 classes
model.classifier = torch.nn.Linear(model.classifier.in_features, num_labels)

# Fine-tune the model on a new dataset
# Assuming 'train_dataloader' is a PyTorch DataLoader for the target dataset
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1, weight_decay=5e-5)
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        inputs, labels = batch
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

Please note that the actual implementation may vary, and the above code is a high-level example. For actual use, one would need to adapt the code to the specific dataset and task, handle device placement (CPU/GPU), and potentially use a more sophisticated training loop with validation, learning rate scheduling, and other best practices.

[More Information Needed]: There is no direct code block reference provided in the references, so the code snippet above is a conceptual example based on common practices for fine-tuning deep learning models in PyTorch.

### Out-of-Scope Use

As the sociotechnic on the deep learning model development team, it is my responsibility to consider the potential for misuse of the `facebook/regnet-y-040` model and to advise users on practices to avoid. Here are some foreseeable misuses and guidance on what users should not do with the model:

1. **Biased Decision-Making**: The `facebook/regnet-y-040` model, like any machine learning model, may inadvertently encode biases present in the training data. Users should not employ this model in applications where biased outputs could lead to unfair or discriminatory practices, especially in sensitive areas such as hiring, law enforcement, or access to services.

2. **Invasion of Privacy**: Users should not use the `facebook/regnet-y-040` model to process images or data in a way that infringes on individuals' privacy rights without their consent. This includes unauthorized surveillance or data harvesting.

3. **Deepfakes and Misinformation**: The model should not be used to create or propagate deepfakes or any form of misinformation that could deceive individuals or disrupt democratic processes.

4. **Intellectual Property Violations**: Users should respect copyright and intellectual property laws when using the model to generate or modify images or content.

5. **Safety and Security**: The model should not be used in safety-critical systems without thorough validation and testing, as the model has been trained with a basic 100 epoch schedule and may not have the robustness required for such applications.

6. **Lack of Enhancements in Regulation**: As the model uses a simple baseline without enhancements (as mentioned in reference 4), users should not assume it has the same level of regularization or augmentation as other models that may be more suitable for specific tasks.

7. **Misrepresentation of Capabilities**: Users should not misrepresent the capabilities of the `facebook/regnet-y-040` model or use it in contexts where it has not been adequately evaluated, as this could lead to errors or overreliance on the model's outputs.

8. **Compliance with License and Conduct**: Users must adhere to the terms of the MIT license under which **pycls** is released, as well as follow the guidelines in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` documents when contributing or modifying the model.

In summary, users of the `facebook/regnet-y-040` model should exercise caution and ethical judgment to prevent misuse that could harm individuals or society. They should also ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards, and consider the limitations of the model as described in the provided references.

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The model `facebook/regnet-y-040` is a deep learning model designed for visual recognition tasks. Based on the provided references, we can identify several known or foreseeable issues that may arise from the use of this model:

1. **Performance Variation Across Compute Regimes**: Reference 1 and 3 suggest that the performance of the model can vary significantly depending on the number of stages and the depth of the network. While fixed-depth networks can match variable depth networks across different flop regimes, there may be a need for further optimization in low-compute regimes where the model's performance may not be as strong.

2. **Activation Function Sensitivity**: As per Reference 2, the choice of activation function (Swish vs. ReLU) can impact the model's performance differently at low and high flops. This indicates that the model's performance may be sensitive to the choice of activation function, which could lead to misunderstandings or suboptimal performance if not carefully considered.

3. **Interaction with Depthwise Convolution**: Reference 4 highlights an interesting interaction between the Swish activation function and depthwise convolution, suggesting that certain architectural choices can have unexpected effects on performance. This could be a limitation if not properly understood or if the model is applied in contexts where these interactions are not favorable.

4. **Generalization and Robustness**: Reference 11 points out that the REGNET models, including `facebook/regnet-y-040`, use a basic 100 epoch training schedule with minimal regularization. While this provides a strong baseline, it may also mean that the model is less robust to overfitting or may not generalize as well as models trained with more sophisticated regularization techniques and longer schedules.

5. **Sociotechnical Considerations**: While the technical references do not explicitly address sociotechnical issues, we can foresee potential harms such as biases in the model's predictions if the training data is not representative of the diversity of real-world scenarios. Additionally, there may be ethical concerns regarding the use of the model in surveillance or other sensitive applications where automated visual recognition can have significant societal impacts.

6. **Model Scaling and Transferability**: Reference 10 discusses the scaling of models across different complexities, which may present challenges in transferring the model to different domains or tasks that require different levels of complexity.

7. **Citation and Acknowledgment**: Reference 7 emphasizes the importance of proper citation and acknowledgment when using the `pycls` library or the baseline results from the Model Zoo. Failure to do so could lead to ethical issues related to academic integrity and intellectual property.

In summary, while `facebook/regnet-y-040` shows promise as a visual recognition model, there are technical limitations related to performance variation, activation function sensitivity, and interactions with architectural choices. Sociotechnical issues such as potential biases, ethical concerns, and the need for proper citation are also important to consider. Further research and careful application are necessary to address these issues.

### Recommendations

Based on the provided references, here are some recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model `facebook/regnet-y-040`:

1. **Model Complexity and Stages**: Reference 1 suggests that reducing the number of stages in the network to three results in worse performance. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain or explore more than three stages in the network for optimal performance. Future work could investigate if modifications in other parts of the network, such as the stem or head, could compensate for a reduced number of stages.

2. **Inverted Bottleneck**: As per Reference 2, using an inverted bottleneck (where b < 1) degrades performance, especially in a low-compute regime. It is recommended to avoid using inverted bottlenecks in the design of the network, particularly when computational resources are limited.

3. **Activation Functions**: Reference 2 and 4 highlight that the choice of activation function can significantly impact performance. Swish outperforms ReLU at low flops, but ReLU is better at high flops. Additionally, when g is restricted to 1 (depthwise convolution), Swish performs much better than ReLU. It is recommended to carefully choose the activation function based on the computational budget and whether depthwise convolution is used.

4. **Fixed vs. Variable Depth**: Reference 3 indicates that fixed-depth networks can match the performance of variable depth networks across different flop regimes. It is recommended to consider using a fixed depth of around 20 blocks, as this simplifies the network design without compromising performance.

5. **Network Design Paradigm**: Reference 5 suggests that designing network spaces is a promising area for future research. It is recommended to continue exploring and refining network design paradigms to improve performance.

6. **Model Comparisons**: Reference 6 and 8 emphasize that REGNET models, including `facebook/regnet-y-040`, perform well across a wide range of compute regimes and can serve as a strong baseline for future work. It is recommended to highlight the model's performance across different computational budgets when publishing and comparing to other models.

7. **Training Schedule and Regularization**: Reference 7 and 8 note that REGNET models use a basic 100 epoch schedule with no regularization except weight decay. While this setup allows for fair comparisons, it is recommended to explore the effects of longer training schedules and stronger regularization techniques to potentially enhance the model's performance.

In summary, the recommendations for the `facebook/regnet-y-040` model involve maintaining a careful balance between network complexity, activation functions, and depth, as well as considering the impact of training schedules and regularization on performance. Future research should continue to explore network design spaces and the interactions between different network components.

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps for the data used in training the `facebook/regnet-y-040` model are not explicitly detailed in the provided references. However, since the model is compared to other models on the ImageNet dataset and follows standard practices for network architecture evaluation, we can infer some common preprocessing steps typically used for ImageNet classification tasks:

Additional information would be needed to accurately provide these details.

## Evaluation

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

The model `facebook/regnet-y-040` evaluates on the following benchmarks or datasets:

1. ImageNet: The model is developed and tested on the ImageNet dataset, which is a standard benchmark in image classification tasks.
2. ImageNetV2: To study the generalization of the model, it is also evaluated on ImageNetV2, a new test set collected following the original procedure of ImageNet to ensure the model's robustness and performance consistency on a different but related dataset.

#### Factors

The foreseeable characteristics that will influence how the model `facebook/regnet-y-040` behaves are as follows:

1. **Training Schedule and Regularization**: As per reference 1, the REGNET models, including `facebook/regnet-y-040`, use a basic 100 epoch training schedule with minimal regularization (only weight decay). This is in contrast to many mobile networks that employ longer training schedules with various enhancements. Therefore, the performance of `facebook/regnet-y-040` may be influenced by its relatively simpler training regimen, which could affect its generalization capabilities compared to models trained with more complex schedules and regularization techniques.

2. **Model Architecture**: Reference 2 indicates that the number of stages and blocks within those stages can significantly impact performance. `facebook/regnet-y-040` follows a design with a specific number of stages and blocks that have been optimized for performance. Deviations from this design, such as reducing the number of stages, have been shown to result in worse performance, suggesting that the model's architecture is a critical factor in its behavior.

3. **Activation Functions**: According to reference 3, the choice of activation function (Swish vs. ReLU) can influence the model's performance across different computational regimes. While Swish outperforms ReLU at low flops, ReLU is better at high flops. This characteristic will affect `facebook/regnet-y-040`'s performance depending on the computational resources available.

4. **Mobile Regime Performance**: Reference 4 highlights that REGNET models are surprisingly effective in the mobile regime (∼600MF), which suggests that `facebook/regnet-y-040` is likely to perform well in mobile or resource-constrained environments. This is important for applications where the model needs to be deployed on devices with limited computational power.

5. **Depth of the Network**: Reference 5 discusses the observation that fixed-depth networks can match the performance of variable depth networks across different flop regimes. This suggests that the depth of `facebook/regnet-y-040`, which is stable at around 20 blocks, is a key characteristic that enables it to maintain consistent performance across different computational settings.

6. **Compute Regimes**: Reference 6 emphasizes that good REGNET models are available across a wide range of compute regimes, including low-compute regimes. This means that `facebook/regnet-y-040` is expected to be versatile and perform well even in environments with limited computational resources.

7. **Robustness of Error Estimates**: Reference 7 indicates that the top models are re-trained multiple times to obtain robust error estimates. This process likely contributes to the reliability of `facebook/regnet-y-040`'s performance metrics, suggesting that the model's behavior should be consistent across different runs.

8. **Generalization to New Data**: Reference 8 points out that while model ranks are preserved on a new test set (ImageNetV2), absolute errors increase. This implies that `facebook/regnet-y-040`'s performance may degrade on new datasets that differ from the original training data (ImageNet), and its generalization capabilities may be influenced by the domain and context of the data it is applied to.

In terms of population subgroups and disaggregated evaluation, [More Information Needed] as the references do not provide specific insights into how `facebook/regnet-y-040` performs across different demographic or population subgroups. It would be important to conduct further evaluations to uncover any disparities in performance that may exist when the model is applied to diverse datasets representing various population characteristics.

#### Metrics

The evaluation of the model `facebook/regnet-y-040` will focus on several metrics that consider the tradeoffs between different errors and performance aspects:

1. **Accuracy on ImageNet and ImageNetV2**: The model's performance will be evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, as well as on the newer ImageNetV2 test set to study generalization. It is noted that while overall model ranks are preserved on ImageNetV2, absolute errors increase.

2. **Comparison with Other Architectures**: The model will be compared with other architectures such as RESNE(X)T and EFFICIENTNET models. The comparisons will consider both the consistency of model ranks and the gap between them.

3. **Inference and Training Time**: The model's effectiveness will be assessed given a fixed inference or training time budget, which is particularly relevant for real-world use cases where model training and inference time are critical, such as in self-driving cars.

4. **Compute Efficiency**: The model's speed on GPUs will be highlighted, with REGNET models being up to 5× faster than EFFICIENTNET models on GPUs.

5. **Controlled Training Setup**: To ensure fair comparisons, the REGNET and RESNE(X)T models will be compared under the same training setup. This is to emphasize that the architecture's performance is evaluated independently of enhancements to the training setup and regularization scheme.

6. **Robust Error Estimates**: The best model from the RegNetY design space for each flop regime will be re-trained multiple times to obtain robust error estimates.

7. **Impact of Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Operations**: The model will also be evaluated for gains provided by the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) operation, which is indicated by the transition from RegNetX to RegNetY in the naming convention.

In summary, the evaluation of `facebook/regnet-y-040` will consider accuracy, comparisons with other models, inference and training time efficiency, and robustness of error estimates, all under a controlled and fair training setup.

1. The RegNetX models, which share a similar design space with RegNetY models, show considerable improvements over other architectures under various complexity metrics, suggesting that the RegNetY models, including `facebook/regnet-y-040`, may also exhibit these improvements (Reference 1).

2. The training setup for RegNet models, including `facebook/regnet-y-040`, is standardized to enable fair comparisons with other architectures like EfficientNet. This setup involves a 100 epoch schedule with minimal regularization, optimizing only learning rate and weight decay, which is crucial for isolating gains due to network architecture improvements (Reference 2).

3. RegNet models, presumably including `facebook/regnet-y-040`, demonstrate better scaling of activations with flops compared to EfficientNet, leading to faster GPU training and inference times. This suggests that `facebook/regnet-y-040` may also benefit from these efficiency gains (Reference 3).

4. When compared to standard ResNet and ResNeXt models under the same training setup, RegNet models show improved performance, indicating that `facebook/regnet-y-040` may also outperform these baselines when trained under controlled conditions (Reference 4).

5. In terms of performance across different flop regimes, RegNetY models, which would include `facebook/regnet-y-040`, outperform EfficientNet at intermediate flops and perform better or on par at higher flops. This suggests that `facebook/regnet-y-040` is competitive with state-of-the-art models in its flop regime (Reference 5).

6. The best models from the RegNetY design space, which `facebook/regnet-y-040` is a part of, are selected based on robust error estimates from multiple training runs. This indicates that `facebook/regnet-y-040` has been thoroughly evaluated to ensure reliable performance (Reference 6).

7. The generalization of RegNet models, including `facebook/regnet-y-040`, has been tested on the ImageNetV2 test set, with results showing that model ranks are preserved and the performance gap between models decreases. This suggests that `facebook/regnet-y-040` maintains its performance on a newer test set (Reference 7).

8. The focus of the evaluation is on network architecture rather than enhancements to the training setup or regularization scheme. This means that the performance of `facebook/regnet-y-040` is attributed to its architectural design rather than training tricks, providing a fair comparison to classic models (Reference 8).

In summary, `facebook/regnet-y-040` is part of the RegNetY family that shows promising results in terms of efficiency and performance across a range of computational complexities, with competitive advantages in training and inference speed, and robust generalization capabilities.

## Model Examination

Explainability/Interpretability Section for Model Card: facebook/regnet-y-040

The RegNet models, including facebook/regnet-y-040, are designed with the goal of understanding and improving populations of models for visual recognition tasks. Our approach diverges from the traditional method of optimizing a single model for a specific scenario. Instead, we focus on identifying design principles that enhance the performance of an entire class of models. This approach is grounded in the belief that such principles are more likely to generalize across different settings.

In the development of RegNet models, we have simplified the design space to allow for a higher concentration of top-performing models, which also facilitates more straightforward analysis and interpretation. The RegNet design space is characterized by its regularity and simplicity, which contrasts with the more unconstrained AnyNet design space that allows for varying widths and depths across stages.

For the facebook/regnet-y-040 model, we have observed several key trends:

1. The depth of the model is stable across different computational regimes, with an optimal depth of approximately 20 blocks (60 layers). This stability is in contrast to the common practice of increasing depth for models designed for higher computational budgets.
2. The model employs a bottleneck ratio (b) of 1.0, which effectively removes the bottleneck structure commonly used in other architectures. This design choice simplifies the model and may contribute to its performance.
3. The width multiplier (w_m) of the model is chosen based on a trend observed across good models, which suggests a specific scaling factor that differs from the conventional practice of doubling widths across stages.

In terms of complexity analysis, we consider not only the traditional metrics of flops and parameters but also network activations. Activations, defined as the size of the output tensors of all convolutional layers, can significantly impact the computational requirements of the model, although they are not commonly used as a measure of network complexity.

The interpretability of the RegNet design space is enhanced by our ability to plot and analyze various network properties against network error. This analysis is facilitated by visualizations that provide one-dimensional projections of the complex, high-dimensional design space. These visualizations help us gain insights into the relationships between network structure and performance.

In summary, the facebook/regnet-y-040 model embodies the principles of the RegNet design space, with a focus on regularity, simplicity, and performance across a range of computational regimes. Our methodology emphasizes the interpretability of the design choices and their impact on the model's performance, making the RegNet family of models, including facebook/regnet-y-040, a robust choice for visual recognition tasks.

## Technical Specification

### Model Architecture and Objective

The model `facebook/regnet-y-040` is part of the RegNet family of models, which are designed to be simple, regular networks with a focus on exploring network structure parameters such as width, depth, and groups. The architecture of RegNet models is characterized by a quantized linear parameterization of widths and depths, which is a departure from the common practice of varying these freely across stages in other network designs.

The core architecture of `facebook/regnet-y-040` is based on the RegNet design space, which specifies a network structure via six parameters: depth (`d`), initial width (`w0`), width slope (`wa`), width multiplier (`wm`), bottleneck ratio (`b`), and group width (`g`). The model is constructed by generating block widths and depths using specific equations (referred to as Eqn. (2)-(4) in the references), with constraints on these parameters to ensure the model remains efficient in terms of parameters and memory usage without compromising accuracy.

The objective of the `facebook/regnet-y-040` model is to provide a high-performing network structure that is optimized for image classification tasks. It aims to achieve considerable improvements over standard networks like ResNet and ResNeXt across various complexity metrics and compute regimes, including low-compute regimes where good models from other families may not be available.

The RegNet models, including `facebook/regnet-y-040`, are designed to be fast and low in parameters and memory usage, making them suitable for deployment in environments with limited computational resources, such as mobile devices. They serve as strong baselines for future work in network architecture research and are expected to perform well across a wide range of flop regimes.

For the specific details of the `facebook/regnet-y-040` model, such as the exact values of the six parameters that define its architecture, [More Information Needed] as the provided references do not include these specifics.

### Compute Infrastructure

The compute infrastructure used for training the model `facebook/regnet-y-040` involved increasing the number of GPUs to 8 to enable faster training of the final models at 100 epochs, while keeping the number of images per GPU fixed. This is mentioned in reference 1, where it states that to enable faster training at 100 epochs, the number of GPUs was increased to 8. Additionally, when scaling the batch size, the learning rate was adjusted using the linear scaling rule, and a 5 epoch gradual warmup was applied.

However, there is no specific mention of the exact compute infrastructure details such as the type of GPUs used, the memory capacity, or the interconnect bandwidth for the `facebook/regnet-y-040` model in the provided references. Therefore, for more detailed information about the exact compute infrastructure beyond the number of GPUs and training strategy, [More Information Needed].
