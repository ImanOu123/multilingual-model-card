# Model Card for microsoft/trocr-base-printed

The model microsoft/trocr-base-printed is an end-to-end Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model that leverages pre-trained models for both image understanding and text generation, specifically designed for recognizing printed text without relying on conventional CNN or RNN architectures or complex pre/post-processing steps. It achieves state-of-the-art results on printed text recognition tasks.

## Model Details

### Model Description

Model Name: microsoft/trocr-base-printed

### Model Architecture:
The microsoft/trocr-base-printed model is built upon the Transformer architecture, which includes an image Transformer for visual feature extraction and a text Transformer for language modeling. The model adopts a vanilla Transformer encoder-decoder structure. The encoder processes the image as a sequence of patches to obtain a representation of the image, while the decoder generates a wordpiece sequence guided by the visual features and previous predictions. The model does not use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbone, instead, it processes the image in a sequence of 16x16 patches following the Transformer-based approach.

### Training Procedures:
The training of the TrOCR model consists of two stages. In the first stage, a large-scale synthetic dataset of printed textline images is used to pre-train the model. In the second stage, the model is further pre-trained on two smaller datasets specific to printed and handwritten text recognition tasks. The model is then fine-tuned on downstream text recognition tasks using human-labeled datasets. The pre-training leverages the Masked Image Modeling task, where image patches are randomly masked and the model is tasked with recovering the original visual tokens.

### Parameters:
The model utilizes Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and SentencePiece for output generation, which does not rely on any task-specific vocabularies. The exact number of parameters in the base model is not specified in the provided references, so [More Information Needed] for the exact count.

## Uses

### Direct Use

The `microsoft/trocr-base-printed` model is designed to be an end-to-end solution for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks, specifically for recognizing printed text. As an end-to-end model, it can be used directly on textline images without the need for fine-tuning, complex post-processing steps, or integration into a larger pipeline. This is possible because the model has been pre-trained on a large dataset and leverages the power of Transformer-based architectures for both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

To use the `microsoft/trocr-base-printed` model, you would typically load the model using the Hugging Face Transformers library and then pass your input images directly to the model. The model will output the recognized text as wordpiece tokens, which can then be decoded into human-readable text.

Here's a simplified code snippet to demonstrate how you might use the model. Please note that you need to have the `transformers` library installed and possibly other dependencies like `torch`:

```python
from transformers import TrOCRProcessor, VisionEncoderDecoderModel
from PIL import Image
import requests

# Load the processor and model from Hugging Face
processor = TrOCRProcessor.from_pretrained("microsoft/trocr-base-printed")
model = VisionEncoderDecoderModel.from_pretrained("microsoft/trocr-base-printed")

# Load an image from the web or your local system
url = "http://path.to/your/image.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

# Prepare the image for the model
pixel_values = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt").pixel_values

# Perform OCR by passing the image to the model
output = model.generate(pixel_values)

# Decode the model output into readable text
decoded_text = processor.batch_decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]

print(decoded_text)
```

This code snippet assumes that you have an image either hosted online or stored locally. It uses the `PIL` library to open the image and the `requests` library to fetch it if it's online. The `TrOCRProcessor` is used to preprocess the image into the format expected by the model, and the `VisionEncoderDecoderModel` is the actual OCR model that performs the recognition task. The `generate` method is used to get the model's predictions, and `batch_decode` converts the predictions into human-readable text.

Keep in mind that the actual performance of the model without fine-tuning will depend on how similar your data is to the data the model was originally trained on. If your images are significantly different, you may still need to fine-tune the model on your specific dataset for optimal results.

## Training Details

### Training Data

The training data for the model `microsoft/trocr-base-printed` consists of a large-scale synthetic dataset created for the pre-training phase, which includes hundreds of millions of printed textline images. Additionally, for fine-tuning, the model uses two smaller datasets specific to printed text, totaling 3.3 million textlines, which include real-world receipt images recognized by commercial OCR engines and 1 million synthesized textline images using TRDG with receipt and built-in printed fonts. Data augmentation techniques and image transformations were applied to enhance the diversity of the training data. [More Information Needed] on data pre-processing or additional filtering.

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps for the data used in the `microsoft/trocr-base-printed` model involve several key procedures to prepare the input text images for the Transformer-based architecture. Here's a detailed description of the preprocessing steps:

1. **Image Resizing**: As per reference 9, the input text images are resized to a fixed dimension of 384×384 pixels. This standardization is crucial for the model to process the images consistently.

2. **Image Patching**: Following the resizing, the images are split into a sequence of 16×16 patches. This is in line with the approach used by Vision Transformers (ViT) where an image is treated as a sequence of patches for the Transformer model, as mentioned in reference 9.

3. **Tokenization**: The text recognition task in TrOCR involves predicting wordpiece tokens. During training, the sequence of ground truth tokens is appended with an "[EOS]" token to signify the end of a sentence. Additionally, the sequence is shifted backward by one place, and a "[BOS]" token is added at the beginning to indicate the start of generation, as described in reference 2.

4. **Special Tokens**: The model retains the use of the special "[CLS]" token, which aggregates information from all the patch embeddings and represents the entire image. If DeiT pre-trained models are used for encoder initialization, a distillation token is also included in the input sequence, allowing the model to benefit from the teacher model's knowledge, as stated in reference 4.

5. **Data Augmentation**: To enhance the diversity of the training data, six kinds of image transformations are applied to the printed text images, in addition to keeping the original images. This is to simulate various printing and environmental conditions that the OCR system might encounter in real-world scenarios, as mentioned in reference 7.

6. **Synthetic Data Generation**: For pre-training, the model uses a large-scale dataset of synthesized printed textline images. This dataset is created using TRDG to generate 1 million printed textline images with different fonts, including receipt fonts and built-in printed fonts, as described in reference 7.

7. **Normalization**: The receipt images collected from the real world are processed by commercial OCR engines to obtain text coordinates. These textlines are then cropped and rectified into normalized images, ensuring that the model trains on data that closely resembles the format it will encounter during inference, as mentioned in reference 7.

The preprocessing steps are designed to convert the input images into a suitable format for the Transformer model, which includes resizing, patching, tokenization with special tokens, data augmentation, and normalization. These steps are crucial for the model to effectively learn from both visual features and textual context.

## Evaluation

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

The model `microsoft/trocr-base-printed` evaluates on the SROIE dataset, as mentioned in reference 4 and 6. The SROIE dataset is used to benchmark the model's performance using word-level precision, recall, and F1 score.

#### Factors

The model `microsoft/trocr-base-printed` is designed to perform text recognition tasks, specifically on printed text. Based on the references provided, several characteristics can be anticipated to influence the model's behavior:

1. **Domain and Context**: The model has been fine-tuned on downstream text recognition tasks, which likely include datasets with printed text from various sources such as documents, receipts, and forms. The performance of the model may be optimized for the types of text and layouts present in these datasets. If the model encounters text in contexts that significantly deviate from the training data, such as artistic or highly stylized text, its performance may degrade.

2. **Data Quality and Resolution**: The model employs a resolution of 384×384 and a patch size of 16×16 for the encoders. Text images that are of lower resolution or have noise may not be recognized as accurately. Similarly, the model might perform best on text images that align with the resolution and patch size it was trained on.

3. **Character Alignment**: The model addresses character alignment issues using CTC loss during training. This suggests that the model should be robust in aligning characters in a sequence for recognition. However, extreme cases of misalignment or distortion not represented in the training data could challenge the model.

4. **Tokenization**: The outputs of the model are based on Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and SentencePiece, which do not rely on task-specific vocabularies. This indicates that the model should generalize well across different types of printed text. However, the model's performance might be influenced by the languages and scripts represented in the pre-training and fine-tuning datasets.

5. **Population Subgroups**: The references do not provide specific information about the diversity of the datasets used for pre-training and fine-tuning in terms of languages, scripts, or demographic representation of the text sources. [More Information Needed] to assess whether there are disparities in performance across different population subgroups, such as non-native speakers or scripts that are underrepresented in the training data.

6. **Multilingual Capabilities**: The model can be extended for multilingual text recognition with minimal effort by leveraging multilingual pre-trained models in the decoder side and expanding the dictionary. However, the actual performance across different languages would depend on the quality and diversity of the multilingual data used for training.

7. **Hardware Utilization**: The model was pre-trained and fine-tuned using powerful V100 GPUs with 32GB of memory. This suggests that the model may require substantial computational resources to perform optimally, which could influence its deployment in resource-constrained environments.

In summary, the `microsoft/trocr-base-printed` model's behavior will be influenced by the domain and context of the text it encounters, the quality and resolution of the input images, the character alignment, the tokenization method, and potentially the population subgroups represented in the training data. To fully understand the model's performance across different factors and uncover any disparities, a disaggregated evaluation across these characteristics would be necessary.

#### Metrics

For the evaluation of the model `microsoft/trocr-base-printed`, the following metrics will be used:

1. Word-level precision, recall, and F1 score: These metrics are particularly mentioned for the evaluation on the SROIE dataset. Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted words out of all predicted words, recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted words out of all ground truth words, and the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single score that balances both concerns.

2. Character Error Rate (CER): This metric is used for the evaluation on the IAM dataset and is case-sensitive. CER measures the character-level accuracy of the model's predictions, taking into account insertions, deletions, and substitutions.

3. Word Accuracy: This metric is used for scene text datasets and measures the accuracy of the model's predictions at the word level.

The model aims to achieve state-of-the-art results on printed text recognition tasks without complex pre/post-processing steps. The tradeoffs between different errors are not explicitly mentioned in the provided references, but typically, a balance between precision and recall is sought, which is captured by the F1 score. If there are specific tradeoffs between different types of errors (e.g., substitutions vs. insertions/deletions), that information is not provided in the references, and therefore, [More Information Needed].

## Model Examination

Explainability/Interpretability of microsoft/trocr-base-printed:

The TrOCR model, specifically the `microsoft/trocr-base-printed` version, is designed for text recognition tasks and leverages the power of Transformer architectures for both image understanding and wordpiece-level text generation. The model is pre-trained on large-scale synthetic data and fine-tuned on human-labeled datasets, which allows it to achieve state-of-the-art performance without the need for an external language model or convolutional network backbone.

In terms of explainability and interpretability, the TrOCR model's architecture is relatively straightforward, consisting of an encoder-decoder framework that is easy to implement and maintain. The encoder is initialized with image Transformer models such as DeiT and BEiT, which are pre-trained using a Masked Image Modeling task. This task involves tokenizing the original image into visual tokens and then making the model recover the original visual tokens from randomly masked image patches. The decoder is initialized with text Transformer models like RoBERTa and MiniLM, which are pre-trained on large text corpora.

The model's interpretability is further enhanced by the fact that it does not introduce image-specific inductive biases, which means that the learned representations are more general and not tied to specific image features. Additionally, the absence of convolutional layers simplifies the model's internal workings, making it easier to understand how the model processes input images and generates predictions.

For the text recognition pipeline, the model takes textline images and extracts visual features to predict wordpiece tokens based on the image and the previously generated context. The use of "[BOS]" and "[EOS]" tokens at the beginning and end of the ground truth sequence respectively helps in demarcating the start and end of the text generation process, which can aid in understanding the model's predictions.

While the model's design inherently supports some level of interpretability, further work on explainability could involve techniques such as attention visualization, which would allow us to see which parts of the input image the model is focusing on at each step of the prediction. Additionally, ablation studies could be conducted to understand the impact of different components of the model on its performance.

In summary, the TrOCR model's simple yet effective design, along with its Transformer-based architecture, provides a good foundation for interpretability. However, specific methods for enhancing the explainability of the `microsoft/trocr-base-printed` model have not been detailed in the provided references, and further research in this area could be beneficial.

## Technical Specification

### Model Architecture and Objective

The architecture of the model `microsoft/trocr-base-printed` is based on the Transformer architecture, which includes an image Transformer for extracting visual features and a text Transformer for language modeling. The model adopts a vanilla Transformer encoder-decoder structure. The encoder is designed to process the input text image, which is first resized to 384×384 and then split into a sequence of 16×16 patches. These patches are used as input to the image Transformer, which aims to obtain a representation of the image patches. The decoder, on the other hand, generates the wordpiece sequence with the guidance of the visual features obtained from the encoder and the previous predictions. It uses the original Transformer decoder structure, which has a stack of identical layers similar to those in the encoder, with the addition of cross-attention to the previous layer's output.

The objective of the `microsoft/trocr-base-printed` model is to perform end-to-end text recognition. It is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) model that leverages pre-trained computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) models to recognize text in images. Unlike traditional OCR models that rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbone, TrOCR processes the image as a sequence of patches, allowing the model to focus attention variably on different parts of the image. This approach enables the model to achieve state-of-the-art results on printed text image datasets without the need for complex pre- or post-processing steps. Additionally, the model can be easily extended for multilingual text recognition by leveraging multilingual pre-trained models in the decoder and expanding the dictionary.

### Compute Infrastructure

The compute infrastructure used for the pre-training of the TrOCR model included 32 V100 GPUs with 32GBs of memory each. For fine-tuning, 8 V100 GPUs were used. The batch size for all models was set to 2,048, and the learning rate was configured to 5e-5.
