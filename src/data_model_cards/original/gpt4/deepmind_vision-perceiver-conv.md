# Model Card for deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv

The model deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv is a general-purpose deep learning architecture that processes a wide range of input data types, including images, by mapping them to a smaller latent space using Transformer-style attention, and is capable of producing various output forms such as classification labels and optical flow. It extends the original Perceiver model by introducing a convolutional preprocessing step, enhancing its performance on tasks like image classification, and making it competitive with specialized architectures.

## Model Details

### Model Description

Model Card for deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv

## Model Architecture

The deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv is based on the Perceiver IO architecture, which extends the original Perceiver model by Jaegle et al., 2021. The architecture is designed to handle high-dimensional data like images by mapping inputs to a fixed-size latent space using Transformer-style attention mechanisms. The model consists of an encoder that maps input arrays to latent space, a series of processing modules that operate within this latent space, and a decoder that maps the latent arrays to output arrays.

The Perceiver IO uses global query-key-value (QKV) attention operations followed by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), applied independently to each element of the index dimension. The encoder and decoder take in two input arrays, with the first used as input to the key and value networks, and the second used as input to the query network. The output has the same index dimension as the query.

The architecture incorporates GPT-2-style Transformer attention modules, linear projection layers, and 2D Fourier position encodings. It also includes convolutional pre-processing to inject information about the 2D structure of images.

## Training Procedures

The model was trained for ImageNet classification, with hyperparameters set to utilize 2D Fourier position encodings as described in the paper. The training script provided allows replication of the training process. However, certain optimizations, such as using multiple encoder cross-attention layers, were omitted due to their minimal performance improvements and significant impact on training speed.

## Parameters

The model uses hyperparameters N and D, which can be chosen to make computation tractable. The exact values of these hyperparameters are not specified in the provided references and would require additional information. The model's computational complexity, measured in FLOPs, and training step times on 64 TPUv3 cores are detailed in the referenced tables.

## Important Disclaimers

The Perceiver IO architecture is designed to scale to large and multimodal data, but it is important to note that it still faces challenges with compute and memory efficiency compared to traditional Transformers. The model's performance may vary based on the choice of hyperparameters and the specific data modality being processed. Additionally, while the model has been trained on ImageNet, its performance on other datasets or tasks may require further validation.

For full details of the architecture and training procedures, one should refer to Section 4.5, supplemental section H, and Appendix Fig. 7 of the original paper.

## Uses

### Direct Use

The `deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv` model is designed to process inputs directly without the need for domain-specific preprocessing, such as tokenization for language or convolutional preprocessing for images. This is achieved through its Perceiver IO architecture, which maps inputs to a latent space, processes them in that latent space, and then decodes them to an output space. The model's ability to handle inputs and outputs of varying sizes without quadratic dependence on their dimensions makes it versatile and efficient for direct application to tasks.

For image classification tasks, as mentioned in reference 2, the model can be used without fine-tuning by leveraging pre-trained ImageNet classification Perceiver IO models. The model has been pre-trained on a large-scale dataset (JFT), allowing it to generalize well to ImageNet without further training. This means that for standard image classification tasks, the model can be directly used to classify images into the pre-trained categories.

Here's a conceptual code snippet illustrating how you might use the model for image classification without fine-tuning, post-processing, or plugging into a pipeline. Note that this is a conceptual example and not a direct code block from the references provided:

```python
from transformers import PerceiverForImageClassificationLearned

# Load the pre-trained Perceiver model for image classification
model = PerceiverForImageClassificationLearned.from_pretrained('deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv')

# Prepare your image (assuming the image is a PIL image)
from transformers import PerceiverImagePreprocessor

preprocessor = PerceiverImagePreprocessor.from_pretrained('deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv')
inputs = preprocessor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

# Get predictions
outputs = model(**inputs)
logits = outputs.logits

# Convert logits to probabilities
import torch.nn.functional as F

probabilities = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)

# Get the top predicted class
predicted_class = probabilities.argmax(-1).item()
```

This code assumes that the necessary pre-processing steps are included within the model or the preprocessor class, as the Perceiver IO model is designed to minimize the need for domain-specific preprocessing. However, without a direct code block reference from the provided materials, I cannot provide a specific code snippet. If the actual implementation details or usage differ, you would need to refer to the official documentation or the provided Colab notebooks for exact usage instructions.

### Downstream Use

The `deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv` model is a versatile deep learning model that can be fine-tuned for a variety of tasks across different domains. It is based on the Perceiver IO architecture, which allows it to handle arbitrary input and output array sizes, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

When fine-tuning `deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv` for a specific task, such as ImageNet classification, the model can be adapted by replacing the final layer of the decoder to match the number of classes required for the new task. For example, when transferring to ImageNet, which has 1,000 classes, the final linear layer of the decoder would be replaced to output 1,000 classes instead of the 18,000 classes used in pre-training on the JFT dataset.

The model can be integrated into a larger ecosystem or app by using it as a feature extractor or as an end-to-end model for tasks like image classification, optical flow prediction, or even multi-modal tasks like audiovisual autoencoding. The model's ability to process large inputs and outputs efficiently makes it particularly suitable for high-dimensional data like images, which are common in many real-world applications.

Here's a conceptual example of how you might fine-tune the `deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv` model for ImageNet classification:

```python
from transformers import PerceiverForImageClassificationConvProcessing

# Load the pre-trained Perceiver model
model = PerceiverForImageClassificationConvProcessing.from_pretrained('deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv')

# Replace the final layer to match the number of ImageNet classes (1,000)
model.decoder = CustomDecoder(num_classes=1000)

# Fine-tune the model on ImageNet
# Assuming you have a dataloader for ImageNet and a training loop set up
for images, labels in imagenet_dataloader:
    outputs = model(images)
    loss = compute_loss(outputs.logits, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

Please note that the above code is a high-level example and assumes that you have a custom decoder implementation (`CustomDecoder`), a dataloader for ImageNet (`imagenet_dataloader`), a function to compute the loss (`compute_loss`), and an optimizer already set up. The actual fine-tuning process would involve more details, such as setting up the optimizer, learning rate schedule, data augmentations, and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, as mentioned in the references.

[More Information Needed] for the exact code snippet, as the references provided do not include a direct code block for fine-tuning or integration into an app.

### Out-of-Scope Use

As the sociotechnic on the deep learning model development team, it is my responsibility to consider the potential societal impacts and misuse of the `deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv` model. Given the capabilities of the Perceiver IO architecture to handle a wide variety of inputs and tasks, there are several areas where misuse could occur:

1. **Infringement of Intellectual Property**: The model has been trained on datasets that include copyrighted material, such as the THUMOS Challenge datasets and Sintel data. Users should not use the model to generate or manipulate copyrighted content in ways that violate intellectual property laws or the terms of the licenses under which the training data was provided.

2. **Privacy Violations**: Given the model's ability to process and recognize patterns in image and video data, there is a risk that it could be used to analyze personal or sensitive information without consent. Users should not use the model to process data in a manner that infringes upon individuals' privacy rights or in violation of data protection laws.

3. **Deepfakes and Misinformation**: The model's capabilities in video autoencoding and reconstruction could potentially be used to create deepfakes or manipulate media to spread misinformation. Users should not use the model to create or disseminate deceptive content that could undermine trust in digital media.

4. **Bias and Discrimination**: While not explicitly mentioned in the references, any deep learning model can inadvertently learn and perpetuate biases present in the training data. Users should be cautious of using the model in applications where biases could lead to discriminatory outcomes, such as in hiring, law enforcement, or access to services.

5. **Security**: The model could be used to bypass security measures by synthesizing or altering visual data to deceive recognition systems. Users should not use the model for illegal activities, including but not limited to fraud, impersonation, or unauthorized access to secure locations or systems.

6. **Misrepresentation of Performance**: The model has been evaluated on specific tasks and datasets. Users should not overstate or misrepresent the model's capabilities or performance in applications or settings that have not been thoroughly tested.

7. **Commercial Exploitation**: The model is made available under the CC BY 4.0 license, which allows for commercial use. However, users should respect the terms of the license and provide appropriate attribution, and not claim proprietary rights over the model itself.

It is important for users to critically assess the potential impacts of their applications and to seek guidance from multidisciplinary experts when necessary.

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model, as part of the Perceiver IO architecture, is a highly versatile and general-purpose model that has demonstrated good results across a variety of domains. However, there are several known and foreseeable issues that may arise from its deployment and use:

1. **Overfitting**: As mentioned in reference 10, Perceiver models, including the vision-perceiver-conv, have the potential to overfit on datasets like ImageNet without proper regularization. This could lead to poor generalization to unseen data and could result in the model performing suboptimally in real-world applications.

2. **Complex Output Spaces**: Reference 11 highlights that while the Perceiver IO architecture can handle a wide variety of input and output spaces, real-world tasks often have complex output requirements. The model may struggle with tasks that have highly structured outputs or require fine-grained predictions, which could limit its applicability in certain domains.

3. **Data and Representation Bias**: The model's performance is contingent on the data it has been trained on. If the training data contains biases, the model may inadvertently perpetuate or amplify these biases, leading to unfair or unethical outcomes. This is a sociotechnical limitation that requires careful consideration of the datasets used for training and evaluation.

4. **Misunderstandings and Misuse**: Given the model's general-purpose nature, there is a risk that users may apply it to tasks for which it is not well-suited, leading to misunderstandings about its capabilities. Users may also have unrealistic expectations about the model's performance in highly specialized or nuanced tasks.

5. **Licensing and Ethical Use**: As per reference 4, some of the data used to train or demonstrate the model comes with specific licensing terms. Users must ensure they comply with these terms, which may include restrictions on commercial use or requirements to credit the data sources. Ethical considerations must also be taken into account, especially when using the model in sensitive applications.

6. **Technical Limitations**: The model's architecture, while scalable, may still face computational constraints when dealing with extremely large input or output sizes. This could limit its use in resource-constrained environments or require significant computational resources to operate effectively.

7. **Dependency on External Code**: Reference 5 indicates that part of the model's codebase originates from external repositories. Any issues, bugs, or updates in these dependencies could affect the model's performance or security.

8. **Domain Adaptation**: Reference 7 discusses experiments with varying levels of domain adaptation. The model may require additional adaptation to perform optimally in specific domains, which could involve extra preprocessing or fine-tuning steps.

9. **Comparative Performance**: According to reference 9, while Perceiver IO is competitive with other models like the Vision Transformer (ViT) family, it may not always be the best-performing model for image classification tasks. Users should consider the trade-offs between generality and task-specific performance when choosing a model for their application.

In conclusion, while the deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model is a powerful tool, it is important to be aware of its limitations and potential issues. Careful consideration of the model's application, the data it is trained on, and the societal implications of its use is essential to ensure responsible and effective deployment.

### Recommendations

Based on the provided references, here are some recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv:

1. **Data and Licensing**: Ensure that all data used for training and evaluation, such as images from Getty Images and video clips from the THUMOS Challenge datasets, are properly licensed and that the use complies with the terms of those licenses. Users of the model should be informed about the licensing terms of the datasets and any restrictions that might apply to the use of the model's outputs.

2. **Generalization and Regularization**: Given that Perceiver models can overfit on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, it is important to consider regularization techniques when training on new datasets. Users should be cautious about overfitting and may need to adjust regularization parameters when fine-tuning the model on their specific tasks.

3. **Multimodal and Multitask Applications**: While Perceiver IO is designed to handle multimodal and multitask settings, users should be aware that performance can vary across different domains. It is recommended to thoroughly evaluate the model on specific tasks and consider additional fine-tuning or adaptation to optimize performance for particular modalities or tasks.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: As a sociotechnic, it is important to consider the ethical implications of deploying this model. Users should be aware of potential biases in the training data and the impact these biases could have on the model's outputs. It is recommended to conduct bias audits and ensure that the model is used in a manner that is fair and does not perpetuate or amplify existing societal biases.

5. **Intellectual Property**: The code and architecture of Perceiver IO are based on prior works, such as the GPT-2-style Transformer attention modules and the autoaugment.py file from the TensorFlow repository. Users should respect the intellectual property of these works and adhere to the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license under which the Perceiver IO model and associated data are made available.

6. **Transparency and Documentation**: It is recommended to provide comprehensive documentation about the model's capabilities, limitations, and the contexts in which it has been evaluated. This includes providing information about the datasets used for training and evaluation, as well as the performance metrics achieved on those datasets.

7. **Responsible Use**: Users should be informed about the responsible use of the model, including considerations around privacy, consent, and the potential impact on individuals and communities. It is important to use the model in ways that respect individual rights and do not cause harm.

In summary, while the Perceiver IO model offers a promising approach to handling a variety of input and output types, it is important to consider the broader societal and ethical implications of its use, ensure compliance with data licensing, be cautious of overfitting, and provide clear documentation and guidance for users.

## Training Details

### Training Data

The training data for the model deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv includes the ImageNet dataset for image classification tasks, as described in section 4.5 of the paper [2]. Additionally, the model was pretrained on the JFT dataset, a large-scale, multi-labeled dataset with 300 million images spanning approximately 18,000 classes, to improve generalization and prevent overfitting on ImageNet-scale datasets, as mentioned in reference 6. For more detailed information on data pre-processing or additional filtering, please refer to the provided training scripts and documentation.

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing

The preprocessing for the data of the model deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv involves a convolutional preprocessing step to reduce the input dimensionality before feeding the data into the Perceiver IO architecture. Specifically, the input images are first processed by applying a 2D convolution with matched kernel and stride to downsample the inputs. This is referred to as a "linear projection of flattened patches" in the ViT literature. The result of this preprocessing is that the input to the network is a 56 × 56 feature grid instead of the original size of 224 × 224, as mentioned in reference 9.

Additionally, in some experiments, a less expensive input model is used which includes a 7×7 convolution to 64 channels, followed by a max pool operation. This is similar to the preprocessing used in the ImageNet experiments. After this step, the Perceiver IO architecture processes the data, and the output is a feature grid with stride 4 and 64 channels. On top of this, a RAFT upsampling layer is applied, which involves a linear projection from 64 dimensions to 2, as described in reference 10.

No explicit tokenization step is mentioned for image data, as tokenization is typically associated with text data. The preprocessing steps described are specific to image modality and are designed to make the high-dimensional image data manageable for the Perceiver IO model, which can handle inputs of any shape or spatial layout, as stated in reference 5.

In summary, the preprocessing for the deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model includes downsampling the input images through convolutional layers and pooling to create a lower-dimensional feature grid suitable for processing by the Perceiver IO architecture.

#### Training Hyperparameters

The training hyperparameters for the model `deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv` are as follows:

- **Training Duration**: The model is trained for 110 epochs.
- **Batch Size**: A batch size of 1024 is used during training.
- **Hardware**: The model is trained on 64 TPUv3 cores.
- **Optimizer**: The LAMB optimizer is used with a specific learning rate schedule.
- **Learning Rate Schedule**: A flat learning rate of 2 × 10^-3 is used for the first 55 epochs, followed by a cosine decay schedule to 0 over the final 55 epochs.
- **Weight Decay**: A weight decay of 0.1 is applied.
- **Gradient Clipping**: Gradients are clipped to a maximum global norm of 10.
- **Dropout**: No dropout is used in the training process.
- **Architecture**: The model uses an architecture with weight sharing in depth, consisting of 8 blocks with 6 attention modules each, and weights are shared between corresponding modules in each block.
- **Regularization**: To prevent overfitting, the model is pretrained on the JFT dataset, which is a large-scale, multi-labeled internal dataset with 300 million images spanning approximately 18,000 classes. The pretraining uses a base learning rate of 3 × 10^-4 with a cosine decay schedule, decaying to 0 over 14 epochs.

[More Information Needed] on the specific details regarding the use of encoder cross-attention layers and the exact configurations of the QKV attention and MLP within the Transformer attention modules, as these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided references.

#### Speeds, Sizes, Times

The model `deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv` is a state-of-the-art deep learning model that leverages the Perceiver IO architecture for processing visual data. Below are the details regarding the model's throughput, training duration, checkpoint sizes, and other relevant information:

- **Throughput**: The computational complexity for a forward pass on a 368 × 496 image is approximately 987 billion FLOPs. The model uses a latent array with 2048 elements and 512 channels and 24 self-attention modules, each with 16 self-attention heads. The input to the network after preprocessing is 56 × 56 instead of 224 × 224, which leads to a moderate reduction in the number of FLOPs used by the model.

- **Training Duration**: The model was trained on the AutoFlow dataset, which consists of 400,000 image pairs, for 480 epochs using a cosine learning rate schedule starting at a learning rate of 4e-4. The batch size used was 512. For other experiments, models were trained for 100 epochs using 32-frame clips at train time.

- **Checkpoint Sizes**: The model has roughly 27.9 million parameters. However, the exact checkpoint sizes are not provided in the references, so [More Information Needed] regarding the specific sizes of the saved model checkpoints.

- **Start or End Time**: The references do not provide specific start or end times for the training process. Therefore, [More Information Needed] for precise training start or end times.

- **Additional Information**: The model uses the LAMB optimizer and follows the default curriculum for AutoFlow, which gradually increases the severity of the augmentations over time. The model also includes an additional phase in this curriculum to address issues with naïve training on AutoFlow.

For further experimentation and visualization, there are Colab notebooks available:

## Evaluation

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

The model deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv has been evaluated on the following benchmarks or datasets:

1. Wikipedia+C4 for masked language modeling (Reference 1).
2. Sintel and KITTI datasets for optical flow (Reference 1).
3. ImageNet for image classification (Reference 2).
4. Kinetics-700-2020 dataset for multimodal autoencoding, which includes video, audio, and class labels (Reference 6).
5. AudioSet for multimodal video + audio classification (Reference 3).
6. Multi-task GLUE for language understanding (Reference 1).
7. StarCraft II for symbolic representations in games (Reference 2).

#### Factors

The model deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv is designed to be a generalist model capable of handling a variety of domains and tasks, as evidenced by its evaluation across language understanding, visual understanding, multi-modal, multi-task settings, and symbolic representations for games (Reference 1). However, there are several characteristics that can influence its behavior:

1. **Domain and Task Specificity**: The model has been tested on a range of tasks including language modeling, image classification, optical flow prediction, autoencoding, and game playing. Its performance may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the domain or task it is applied to. For instance, it achieves high accuracy on ImageNet classification (Reference 2) and preserves a high win rate in StarCraft II (Reference 3), but its performance on other tasks or datasets not covered in the evaluation may differ.

2. **Data Modality**: The Perceiver IO model is capable of handling different data modalities, such as video, audio, and class labels (Reference 4). The way it combines these modalities through padding and serialization into a single input array (Reference 5) may affect its performance, especially if the model encounters data with modalities or combinations that it was not explicitly trained on.

3. **Data Dimensionality and Scale**: The model is designed to work with data of different dimensions and scales, from 3D (video) to 0D (class labels) (Reference 5). However, performance may be influenced by the dimensionality and scale of the data it processes, particularly if it encounters data that significantly deviates from what it was trained on.

4. **Population Subgroups**: The model card does not provide specific information on the performance of the model across different population subgroups. Without disaggregated evaluation, it is difficult to uncover disparities in performance that may exist across different demographics or subgroups within the population. [More Information Needed]

5. **Pretraining and Regularization**: The model's behavior is also influenced by its pretraining on the JFT dataset, which contains a large number of images and classes (Reference 8). This pretraining helps prevent overfitting on smaller datasets like ImageNet. However, the characteristics of the JFT dataset, including any biases or imbalances it may contain, could influence the model's behavior and generalization to other datasets.

6. **Multimodal Autoencoding**: When used for multimodal autoencoding on the Kinetics-700-2020 dataset, the model's ability to reconstruct multimodal inputs may be influenced by the nature of the bottleneck induced by the architecture (Reference 4). The performance in this context may vary depending on the complexity and nature of the multimodal data it is trained to autoencode.

In summary, while the Perceiver IO model is designed to be a versatile and generalist model, its behavior is influenced by the specific domains and tasks it is applied to, the modalities and dimensionality of the data, the characteristics of the pretraining dataset, and the architecture's handling of multimodal data. Disaggregated evaluation across different factors is necessary to fully understand any disparities in performance, particularly across population subgroups, for which more information is needed.

#### Metrics

Based on the provided references, the evaluation metrics for the model `deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv` will likely include the following:

1. **Classification Accuracy**: Since the model has been evaluated on ImageNet classification (Reference 7), a standard metric for this task is top-1 and top-5 accuracy, which measures the percentage of test images for which the correct label is the model's most confident prediction (top-1) or among the five most confident predictions (top-5).

2. **Optical Flow Accuracy**: For tasks like Sintel/KITTI optical flow (Reference 1), standard metrics include Average Endpoint Error (AEE) and the percentage of pixels where the flow estimate is within a certain threshold of the ground truth (e.g., Fl-all for KITTI).

3. **Multi-modal and Multi-task Performance**: In multi-modal tasks like Kinetics autoencoding and AudioSet classification (Reference 1), metrics could include classification accuracy, mean Average Precision (mAP), and reconstruction loss for autoencoding tasks.

4. **Symbolic Representation Accuracy**: For games like StarCraft II (Reference 1), the evaluation might involve game-specific metrics that measure the model's ability to predict or generate accurate symbolic representations.

5. **Generalization and Efficiency**: The model's ability to generalize across different tasks and its computational efficiency could be evaluated qualitatively or through ablation studies, as suggested by the references to the model's efficiency and decoupling of depth from input/output size (References 3 and 5).

6. **Error Analysis**: The model card might also include an analysis of different types of errors, such as those due to the resolution of input data (Reference 6) or the trade-offs between different types of errors in multi-task settings (Reference 1).

7. **Comparison with Literature**: The model's performance might be compared with other models in the literature, such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) family, to contextualize its performance (Reference 7).

If there are specific metrics for the convolutional aspects of the `vision-perceiver-conv` model, these are not detailed in the provided references, and thus [More Information Needed] for that part. However, the general metrics for evaluating vision models would still apply.

4. Real-World Data: Perceiver IO was applied to a small set of real videos from Getty Images and performed well out-of-domain, effectively handling challenges such as heavy occlusion and textures with little detail.

5. Comparative Performance: Perceiver IO consistently outperformed the original Perceiver architecture and was competitive with models from the Vision Transformer (ViT) family, especially after pretraining on JFT.

6. Decoder Differences: The model's decoder differs from the original Perceiver, with Perceiver IO using a query-based attention decoder, which contributes to its improved performance across tasks.

The model card should also mention that the results are detailed in the Appendix of the referenced paper, with sections dedicated to ImageNet (Sec. A), StarCraft II (Sec. B), and AudioSet (Sec. C) results. However, for a complete understanding of the model's efficiency on image classification and other specific details, [More Information Needed] as the references do not provide exhaustive tuning or comparative efficiency results.

## Model Examination

Explainability/Interpretability of deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv:

The deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model is built upon the Perceiver IO architecture, which is designed to handle arbitrary input arrays and map them to arbitrary output arrays in a domain-agnostic manner. The core idea behind the Perceiver IO is to process information through a latent space that is typically smaller than the size of the inputs and outputs, making the computation tractable even for large-scale data.

The model utilizes Transformer-style attention mechanisms, which are composed of global query-key-value (QKV) attention operations followed by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). This design allows the model to focus on different parts of the input data and understand the relationships between them, which is crucial for tasks such as visual understanding and language processing.

For explainability, one could look into the attention weights used in the QKV attention operations to gain insights into which parts of the input data the model is focusing on during processing. This can provide a form of interpretability, as it highlights the importance of different input elements for the model's predictions or representations.

Additionally, the Perceiver IO's ability to handle different domains and tasks, as demonstrated by its performance on language understanding, visual understanding, multi-modal, multi-task settings, and symbolic representations for games, suggests that the model learns representations that are transferable across various types of data. This generality itself is a form of interpretability, as it implies that the model captures fundamental aspects of the data that are not specific to a particular domain.

For a more detailed look at the model's interpretability, one could refer to visualizations of the output flow (Section 4.2 in [2]) or video reconstructions (Section 4.3 in [2]) provided in the linked Colab notebooks. These visualizations can help users understand how the model processes and reconstructs visual data, which is a step towards explaining the model's internal workings.

In summary, while the Perceiver IO architecture, and by extension the deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model, is not inherently interpretable, the use of attention mechanisms and the ability to visualize the model's outputs provide avenues for gaining insights into the model's decision-making process. Further research and development in the area of explainability could lead to more sophisticated methods for interpreting the model's behavior.

## Technical Specification

### Model Architecture and Objective

The `deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv` model is based on the Perceiver IO architecture, which is designed to handle a wide variety of input modalities and output tasks with a single neural network architecture. The key innovation of the Perceiver IO is its ability to process inputs by mapping them to a latent space, processing within that latent space, and then decoding to an output space, which allows it to scale efficiently and handle complex output spaces.

The architecture of the model consists of the following components:

1. **Input Encoding**: The model first encodes inputs (e.g., images, audio, text) into a latent space. This is achieved by applying an attention module that maps input arrays `x ∈ R^M×C` to latent arrays `z ∈ R^N×D`, where `M` and `C` are properties of the task data, and `N` and `D` are hyperparameters of the model.

2. **Latent Processing**: The latent array `z` is then processed by a series of modules that operate within the latent space. Each module applies a global query-key-value (QKV) attention operation followed by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP is applied independently to each element of the index dimension.

3. **Output Decoding**: Finally, the model decodes the processed latent arrays to output arrays `y ∈ R^O×E` using another attention module. The output arrays correspond to the task-specific outputs, such as class labels for classification tasks or pixel values for image generation tasks.

4. **Convolutional Preprocessing**: For vision tasks, the model incorporates convolutional preprocessing to inject information about the 2D structure of images. This involves using a 7×7 convolution to 64 channels, followed by a max pool operation. The processed features are then fed through the Perceiver IO architecture.

5. **Objective**: The model is trained to produce one output vector per masked input using learnable position-dependent vectors to query the output of the final latent processing layer. A position-wise linear layer is applied on top of these output vectors, and the model is trained using a softmax cross-entropy loss to predict the original non-masked input as the target.

The Perceiver IO architecture, including the `vision-perceiver-conv` model, is highly versatile and can be applied to a range of tasks, from language understanding to dense visual tasks like optical flow. It is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional Transformer architectures by avoiding quadratic dependence on input or output size, thus enabling efficient scaling to large inputs and outputs.

### Compute Infrastructure

The compute infrastructure used for training the `deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv` model for ImageNet experiments involved the following specifications:

- The model was trained for 110 epochs using a batch size of 1024.
- A total of 64 TPUv3 cores were utilized for the training process.
- The training leveraged the LAMB optimizer with a specific learning rate schedule.
- No initial learning rate warm-up period was used, as it was found to prevent models from training effectively when using LAMB.

For additional details on the training infrastructure, such as the exact model training step time on the 64 TPUv3 cores, please refer to Tab. 8 in the provided references. However, since the exact table is not included in the provided references, we would need to say "[More Information Needed]" for those specific details.
