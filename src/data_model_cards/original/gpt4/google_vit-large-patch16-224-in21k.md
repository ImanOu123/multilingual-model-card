## Model Details

### Model Description

Model Card for google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k

## Model Architecture
The google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k is a Vision Transformer (ViT) model that processes images by splitting them into fixed-size patches. Each patch is linearly embedded, combined with position embeddings, and then fed into a standard Transformer encoder as a sequence of vectors. The model architecture is characterized by its use of self-attention layers that are global, as opposed to the local and translationally equivariant layers in CNNs. The model includes a learnable "classification token" similar to BERT's [class] token, which is used to represent the image for classification tasks.

## Training Procedures
The model is typically pre-trained on large datasets and then fine-tuned on smaller downstream tasks. During pre-training, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer is used as the classification head. For fine-tuning, a single linear layer replaces the pre-trained prediction head. The model can be fine-tuned at a higher resolution than it was pre-trained, which increases the effective sequence length due to a larger number of patches.

## Parameters
The model uses a large-scale Transformer with 16x16 patch size and an input resolution of 224x224 pixels. The "large" in the model name indicates a larger capacity model, which typically means more layers and parameters compared to smaller variants. The model is pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which is denoted by "in21k" in the model name.

## Important Disclaimers
- The Vision Transformer has less image-specific inductive bias compared to CNNs, which may affect its performance on certain types of image data.
- The model's performance can vary significantly depending on the size and nature of the dataset it is fine-tuned on.
- Fine-tuning on higher resolution images than those used in pre-training may yield better results but requires more computational resources.
- The model is designed to be fine-tuned with specific configurations provided in the "How to train your ViT? ..." paper, and users should refer to the paper for guidance on selecting checkpoints and fine-tuning procedures.

## Uses

### Direct Use

The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` can be used directly for image classification tasks without fine-tuning if the dataset it was pre-trained on (ImageNet-21k) is closely related to the target task and the classes of interest are among the 21k classes the model was trained on. In such cases, the pre-trained weights already contain valuable information that can be used to make predictions on new images.

Here's how you can use the model directly for classification:

```python
from transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, ViTForImageClassification
from PIL import Image
import requests

# Load the feature extractor and model from Hugging Face
feature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k')
model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained('google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k')

# Load an image from the web or your local system
url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

# Prepare the image for the model
inputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

# Forward pass, get logits and predictions
outputs = model(**inputs)
logits = outputs.logits
predicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()

# Retrieve the class label using the model's config
class_label = model.config.id2label[predicted_class_idx]

print("Predicted class:", class_label)
```

This code snippet assumes that the necessary libraries (`transformers`, `PIL`, `requests`) are installed and that you have an internet connection to download the model and the image. The model is used to predict the class of the image directly, without any fine-tuning or additional post-processing. The `ViTFeatureExtractor` is used to properly preprocess the image to match the input format the model expects.

If the target task involves different classes or requires higher accuracy than what can be achieved with the pre-trained model alone, fine-tuning on a specific dataset would be necessary. In that case, you would follow the fine-tuning procedures outlined in the references provided.

### Downstream Use

The `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model is a Vision Transformer (ViT) that has been pre-trained on the large ImageNet-21k dataset. This model can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks, such as image classification on different datasets. The fine-tuning process involves replacing the pre-trained prediction head with a new feedforward layer that matches the number of classes in the downstream task. It is also common to fine-tune the model at a higher resolution than the pre-training to improve performance.

When integrating this model into a larger ecosystem or application, it can serve as a powerful feature extractor for image-related tasks. For instance, it can be used in an app that requires image recognition, classification, or any other task where understanding the content of an image is crucial.

To fine-tune the `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model on a new dataset, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Remove the pre-trained prediction head.
2. Attach a new feedforward layer with the appropriate number of outputs for your specific task.
3. Fine-tune the model on your dataset, potentially at a higher resolution than the pre-training.

Here is a conceptual code snippet for fine-tuning the model, assuming you have a compatible training script and environment set up. Note that the actual code may vary depending on the specific libraries and frameworks you are using:

```python
from transformers import ViTForImageClassification

# Load the pre-trained ViT model
model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained('google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k')

# Replace the pre-trained head with a new one for your specific task (e.g., 10 classes)
model.classifier = torch.nn.Linear(model.config.hidden_size, 10)

# Fine-tune the model on your dataset
# [Your dataset loading and training code goes here]

# Example of a training loop (pseudocode)
for images, labels in dataloader:
    outputs = model(images)
    loss = loss_function(outputs.logits, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

Please note that the above code is a simplified example and does not include necessary components such as data preprocessing, optimizer initialization, learning rate scheduling, or evaluation. For actual implementation, you would need to refer to the documentation and examples provided by the libraries you are using, such as Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k, as part of the Vision Transformer (ViT) family, has shown promising results in image classification tasks, especially when pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet-21k. However, there are several known and foreseeable issues that stem from the use of this model:

1. **Memory Efficiency vs. Computational Cost**: Reference 1 indicates that large ViT models are more memory-efficient compared to ResNet models. However, the computational cost for fine-tuning these models can be significant. This could limit the accessibility of the model for researchers or practitioners with limited computational resources.

2. **Model Scaling**: Reference 7 suggests that further scaling of ViT could lead to improved performance. However, scaling up models often requires more computational power and larger datasets, which could exacerbate existing biases if the additional data is not carefully curated.

3. **Generalization to Other Tasks**: Reference 6 points out the challenge of applying ViT to other computer vision tasks beyond image classification, such as detection and segmentation. The model may not perform as well on these tasks without significant modifications or additional training.

4. **Self-Supervised Pre-Training**: The same reference also mentions the potential for self-supervised pre-training methods to improve performance. However, there is still a large gap between self-supervised and large-scale supervised pretraining, indicating that the model may rely heavily on large labeled datasets, which can be expensive and time-consuming to produce.

5. **Inductive Biases**: Reference 11 notes that Transformers lack some of the inductive biases present in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can lead to modest accuracies on mid-sized datasets without strong regularization. This could result in the model not performing as well in more practical, resource-constrained scenarios.

6. **Overfitting on Smaller Datasets**: Reference 9 states that Vision Transformers tend to overfit more than ResNets with comparable computational cost on smaller datasets. This suggests that the model may not be suitable for tasks with limited data availability.

7. **Sociotechnical Considerations**: While not explicitly mentioned in the references, as a sociotechnic, it is important to consider the broader implications of deploying such models. For instance, biases in training data can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes when the model is used in real-world applications. Additionally, the environmental impact of training large-scale models should be considered, as well as the potential for misuse of the technology in surveillance or other privacy-invasive applications.

In conclusion, while the google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model represents a significant advancement in image classification tasks, it is important to be aware of its limitations and the potential for harm if not used responsibly. Further research and careful consideration of the sociotechnical impact are necessary to mitigate these issues.

1. **Exploration of Other Computer Vision Tasks**: The model has shown promise in image recognition tasks. However, it is recommended to further apply and test the Vision Transformer (ViT) on a variety of computer vision tasks, such as object detection and segmentation, to fully understand its capabilities and limitations in these areas.

2. **Self-Supervised Pre-Training**: There is an indication that self-supervised pre-training can improve the model's performance. It is recommended to continue exploring and refining self-supervised pre-training methods to potentially narrow the performance gap between self-supervised and large-scale supervised pre-training.

3. **Memory Efficiency**: The large ViT models demonstrate an advantage in memory efficiency over traditional architectures like ResNet models. It is recommended to leverage this strength when scaling to large datasets, which could be beneficial in terms of computational resources and training time.

4. **Scaling the Model**: Further scaling of the ViT model is likely to lead to improved performance. It is recommended to experiment with scaling the model up, considering the trade-offs between performance gains and increased computational requirements.

5. **Compute Trade-offs**: While Axial-ViT models show better performance, they require more compute. It is recommended to carefully consider the trade-offs between performance improvements and the additional computational costs when deploying or further developing the model.

6. **Dataset Considerations**: The model has been trained on large datasets like ImageNet-21k and JFT. It is recommended to ensure that the datasets used for pre-training are de-duplicated with respect to the test sets of downstream tasks to avoid data leakage and ensure the generalizability of the model.

7. **Pre-Training Efficiency**: The architecture choice, training schedule, optimizer, weight decay, and other parameters can affect pre-training efficiency. It is recommended to conduct controlled studies to understand the performance versus compute trade-offs for different architectures and training setups.

8. **Regularization and Overfitting**: Vision Transformers, including ViT, may overfit more than architectures like ResNets when trained on smaller datasets. It is recommended to employ appropriate regularization techniques and consider the use of early stopping to mitigate overfitting.

9. **Resource Utilization**: The ViT-L/16 model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k performs well while taking fewer resources to pre-train. It is recommended to consider resource utilization and efficiency when training or deploying the model, especially in cloud environments.

In summary, while the google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model shows promising results, it is important to consider the challenges of applying it to a broader range of tasks, improving pre-training methods, balancing compute costs, avoiding overfitting, and optimizing resource utilization.

## Training Details

### Training Data

The training data for the model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k consists of the ImageNet-21k dataset, which contains approximately 14 million images spanning 21,000 classes. The model was initially pre-trained on this large dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on the smaller ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset with 1k classes at a resolution of 224x224 pixels. [More Information Needed] on data pre-processing or additional filtering.

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing

The preprocessing for the data of the model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` involves the following steps:

1. **Image Resizing**: Each input image is resized to a fixed resolution of H×W, where H and W are both 224 pixels for this model variant. This is implied by the model name `patch16-224`, where `224` refers to the image resolution.

2. **Patch Extraction**: The resized image is then split into a grid of 2D patches. The resolution of each patch is 16×16 pixels, as indicated by the `patch16` in the model name. This is derived from the reference stating that the image is reshaped into a sequence of flattened 2D patches (P, P), where P is 16 in this case.

3. **Flattening and Linear Embedding**: Each patch is flattened into a 1D vector and then linearly embedded into a D-dimensional space. The dimensionality D is constant throughout the Transformer layers but is not explicitly stated in the provided references. The linear projection is trainable as mentioned in reference 4.

4. **Adding Position Embeddings**: After the patches are embedded, position embeddings are added to the sequence of patch embeddings to retain positional information, as Transformers do not inherently capture the order of the input sequence.

5. **Classification Token**: Similar to BERT's [class] token, a learnable embedding, referred to as the "classification token" or `x_class`, is prepended to the sequence of embedded patches. The state of this token at the output of the Transformer encoder serves as the image representation for classification tasks.

6. **Preprocessing for Different Resolutions**: If the model is fine-tuned on images of higher resolution than the pre-training, the patch size remains the same, resulting in a larger effective sequence length due to more patches being extracted from the larger image.

The preprocessing does not involve traditional tokenization as in NLP tasks because the model operates on images rather than text. Instead, the image is tokenized into patches which are treated analogously to tokens in NLP.

For any specific code implementations or further details on the dimensionality of the embeddings or the exact architecture of the MLP used in the classification head during pre-training, [More Information Needed] would be the appropriate response as these details are not provided in the references.

- **Weight Decay**: A high weight decay of 0.1 was applied, which was found to be useful for transfer of all models.
- **Learning Rate Schedule**: A linear learning rate warmup and decay was used. [More Information Needed] for the specific values or schedule details.
- **Fine-tuning**: For fine-tuning, SGD with momentum was used, with a batch size of 512. [More Information Needed] for the specific momentum value.
- **Regularization**: During pre-training, basic regularization parameters such as weight decay, dropout, and label smoothing were optimized. [More Information Needed] for the specific values of dropout and label smoothing.
- **Early Stopping**: Early stopping was used based on the best validation accuracy achieved during training.
- **Resolution for Fine-tuning**: For fine-tuning, higher resolution images were used compared to pre-training. Specifically, a resolution of 512 was used for ViT-L/16. [More Information Needed] for the exact resolution used for `vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` if different from ViT-L/16.
- **Averaging**: Polyak & Juditsky averaging with a factor of 0.9999 was used during fine-tuning.

## Model Examination

### Model Card - Explainability/Interpretability Section

For the `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model, we have conducted several analyses to understand how the Vision Transformer (ViT) processes and integrates information across the image, which is crucial for explainability and interpretability of the model's decision-making process.

1. **Global Information Integration**: Our findings indicate that the model is capable of integrating information globally across the image, even in the lower layers of the network. This is facilitated by the self-attention mechanism, which allows some attention heads to attend to most of the image from the very beginning, akin to a large receptive field in CNNs (Reference 2).

2. **Attention Distance Analysis**: We have analyzed the average attention distance spanned by attention weights at different layers. The attention distance is highly variable across heads in lower layers, with some heads attending to much of the image, while others focus on small regions. As the network depth increases, the attention distance also increases for all heads, suggesting a hierarchical processing of visual information (Reference 3).

3. **Attention Rollout**: To visualize how the model attends to different parts of the image, we used Attention Rollout. This method involves averaging attention weights across all heads and recursively multiplying the weight matrices of all layers, providing a map of attention from the output token to the input space (Reference 4).

4. **Position Embeddings**: The model learns a learned position embedding that encodes the distance within the image. Closer patches tend to have more similar position embeddings, and there is an apparent row-column structure, indicating that the model learns spatial relationships between patches (Reference 5).

5. **Internal Representation Analysis**: To begin to understand the internal processing of the Vision Transformer, we analyzed the first layer's linear projection of flattened patches into a lower-dimensional space. This analysis helps in understanding the foundational representations the model builds upon (Reference 6).

6. **Scaling and Ablation Studies**: We conducted ablation studies on scaling different dimensions of the Transformer architecture. These studies help in identifying which components contribute most to the model's performance and can guide future efforts in model scaling and design (Reference 8).

In summary, our analyses provide insights into the Vision Transformer's ability to process and integrate visual information, which is essential for interpretability. The model's attention mechanisms and learned embeddings offer a window into its decision-making process, which can be further explored for improved explainability.

## Technical Specification

### Model Architecture and Objective

The architecture of the model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` is based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) design. The model processes images by first splitting them into fixed-size patches. Each image is reshaped from a 2D grid of pixels into a 1D sequence of flattened 2D patches. Specifically, for an image of resolution `H×W` with `C` channels, it is divided into patches of resolution `P×P`. The number of patches `N` is given by `HW/P^2`, which also defines the sequence length for the Transformer.

Each patch is then linearly embedded, and position embeddings are added to retain positional information. This sequence of vectors is then fed into a standard Transformer encoder, similar to the encoders used in NLP for processing sequences of token embeddings.

For the classification objective, the model employs a learnable "classification token" (analogous to BERT's [class] token) that is prepended to the sequence of embedded patches. The state of this classification token at the output of the Transformer encoder serves as the image representation for classification tasks. During pre-training, a classification head with one hidden layer is attached to this token, and during fine-tuning, a single linear layer is used.

The model is pre-trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned on various mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks. When fine-tuning on higher resolution images, the patch size remains the same, resulting in a longer effective sequence length for the Transformer to process.

The `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model specifically uses patches of size 16x16 on images of resolution 224x224 and is pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset. The "large" in the model name indicates the size of the Transformer architecture, which has more layers and parameters compared to smaller variants, allowing it to potentially capture more complex features and achieve higher accuracy on various tasks.
