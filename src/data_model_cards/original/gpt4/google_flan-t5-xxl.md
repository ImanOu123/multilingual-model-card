# Model Card for google/flan-t5-xxl

The model google/flan-t5-xxl is a large-scale, dense encoder-decoder language model that has been instruction-finetuned on a diverse collection of tasks to improve its performance and generalization to unseen tasks. It leverages the Flan finetuning procedure to achieve strong few-shot performance, even when compared to much larger models.

## Model Details

### Model Description

Model Architecture:
The model `google/flan-t5-xxl` is part of the Flan-T5 series, which is a set of dense encoder-decoder models. Specifically, the XXL variant of Flan-T5 has 11 billion weights, making it one of the largest models in the series. It is based on the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) architecture, which has been reimplemented in JAX and Flax as part of the T5X framework, an improved version of the original T5 codebase.

Training Procedures:
The training of `google/flan-t5-xxl` involved instruction finetuning, which is a process where the model is fine-tuned on a set of tasks with instructions. This approach has been applied across a broad range of model families, including T5, PaLM, and U-PaLM. The training procedure for each model was consistent, with adjustments made only for a few hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, dropout, and finetuning steps. The model uses a constant learning rate schedule for finetuning. The amount of compute used for finetuning is a small fraction relative to the training compute. For example, instruction-finetuning Flan-PaLM 540B used only 0.2% of the pre-training compute.

Parameters:
As mentioned, `google/flan-t5-xxl` has 11 billion parameters. The learning rate, batch size, and dropout were identified as the most important hyperparameters for instruction finetuning. The global batch size is reported, and due to packing, the effective batch size is larger. Specific values for these hyperparameters for the XXL model are detailed in Table 22 of the referenced material.

Important Disclaimers:
- The model is significantly large, and running single-host experiments with multi-host quota is not possible (e.g., you cannot run `tpu_v2=8` using `TPU V2 pod`).
- The model was trained using the T5X framework on Vertex AI, which simplifies the process of creating TPU instances and managing resources.
- The model's performance improvements are attributed to instruction finetuning, as shown in the evaluation results (Table 5). However, the exact performance metrics and improvements for `google/flan-t5-xxl` are not provided in the reference and would require [More Information Needed].
- The model is part of a study that includes models of various sizes, and the training procedures and hyperparameters are consistent across these models, with the exception of a few adjustments.

For further details on the model's performance, specific hyperparameter values, and other nuanced information, one would need to refer to the full paper or documentation associated with the model, which is not provided in the reference material above.

## Uses

### Direct Use

The model `google/flan-t5-xxl` can be used for inference without fine-tuning, post-processing, or plugging into a pipeline by using the provided `t5x/infer.py` script. This script allows you to run the model with a `seqio.Task` to generate predictions for the inputs. The predictions are logged in a JSON file along with the input prompts. Here is a simplified code snippet based on the reference provided:

```sh
INFER_OUTPUT_DIR="..."  # directory to write infer output
T5X_DIR="..."  # directory where the t5x is cloned, e.g., ${HOME}"/t5x".
TFDS_DATA_DIR="..."
CHECKPOINT_PATH="..."

# Assuming the environment variables are set as per the instructions
# and the necessary data is available in TFDS_DATA_DIR,
# you can run the inference script like this:

python ${T5X_DIR}/t5x/infer.py \
  --gin_file="${T5X_DIR}/t5x/configs/models/t5/xxl.gin" \
  --gin.MODEL_DIR="'${CHECKPOINT_PATH}'" \
  --gin.INFER_OUTPUT_DIR="'${INFER_OUTPUT_DIR}'" \
  --gin.TASK_FEATURE_LENGTHS="{'inputs': 512, 'targets': 114}" \
  --gin.INFER_MODEL_KEY="'flan-t5-xxl'" \
  --gin.INFER_INPUT_FILE_PATTERN="'${TFDS_DATA_DIR}/your_input_file.tfrecord'"
```

Please replace the placeholders (`...`) with the actual paths to your directories and files. The `INFER_OUTPUT_DIR` is where the inference output will be written, `T5X_DIR` is the directory where the T5X repository is cloned, `TFDS_DATA_DIR` is the directory containing the TensorFlow Datasets data, and `CHECKPOINT_PATH` is the path to the model checkpoints.

Note that the above code snippet assumes that you have already set up your environment according to the instructions provided in the references, including the installation of the necessary libraries and the setup of the Google Cloud environment for accessing TPUs if needed.

If you need to run the model on specific input prompts without using a TFRecord file, you would need to create such a file with your inputs or modify the inference script to accept raw text inputs, which is not directly covered in the provided references. In that case, you would need additional information or code modifications.

### Downstream Use

The `google/flan-t5-xxl` model is a large-scale language model that has been fine-tuned with instruction following capabilities, making it particularly adept at handling a variety of NLP tasks when provided with the right prompts. This model can be integrated into a larger ecosystem or application to enhance its language understanding and generation capabilities.

When fine-tuned for a specific task, `google/flan-t5-xxl` can be expected to perform well on tasks such as zero-shot and few-shot learning, reasoning, and question answering. This is due to the instruction fine-tuning process it has undergone, which has been shown to improve performance and generalization to unseen tasks (Reference 10). The model has been trained on a diverse set of instructions, which allows it to understand and execute a wide range of tasks without the need for extensive task-specific training data.

For deployment, the pretrained model can be exported as a TensorFlow Saved Model and deployed to Vertex AI Prediction service using the Optimized TensorFlow Runtime (Reference 7). This makes it suitable for integration into applications that require real-time language processing capabilities.

Here's an example of how you might use the model in a Python application, assuming you have already set up the necessary environment and have the model available:

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, TFT5ForConditionalGeneration

# Load the tokenizer and model from Huggingface
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained('google/flan-t5-xxl')
model = TFT5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('google/flan-t5-xxl')

# Prepare the prompt for the task
prompt = "Translate English to French: 'Hello, how are you?'"

# Tokenize the input text
input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='tf').input_ids

# Generate the output
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, num_beams=5)

# Decode the generated text
translated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(translated_text)
```

Please note that the above code snippet is a general example of how to use a T5 model with the Huggingface Transformers library. The actual parameters such as `max_length` and `num_beams` may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the task and the capabilities of the `google/flan-t5-xxl` model.

For more specific use cases or integration into a larger system, additional code and setup would be required, and the details would depend on the particular application and its architecture. [More Information Needed] for any further specifics on integrating the model into a particular ecosystem or app.

### Out-of-Scope Use

As a sociotechnic member of the deep learning model development team, I would like to highlight the potential misuses of the model google/flan-t5-xxl and provide guidance on what users should avoid doing with this model.

Foreseeable Misuses:
1. **Harmful Language Generation**: According to Rae et al. (2021a), language models like Flan-T5 can be used to generate language that is harmful. Users should not use Flan-T5 to create content that promotes hate speech, violence, or discrimination.
2. **Bias Replication**: The model is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that has not been filtered for explicit content or assessed for biases (Ethical Considerations & Risks). Users should not use the model in applications where these biases could lead to unfair treatment or discrimination of individuals or groups.
3. **Dehumanization**: There have been instances of potential dehumanization harms identified in pre-trained language models (Results). Users should not use the model in ways that could dehumanize individuals or groups.
4. **Gender Bias**: The model has shown a tendency to perform worse on examples where the correct translation should include "she" pronouns rather than "he" pronouns (Results). Users should not use the model in contexts where such gender biases could perpetuate gender inequality or misrepresentation.

What Users Ought Not to Do:
- **Unassessed Direct Application**: Users should not deploy Flan-T5 directly in any application without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application context (Reference 1).
- **Lack of Contextual Risk Assessment**: Users should not use the model without considering the full range of potential risks and anticipating risks specific to their application context (Reference 4).
- **Ignoring Potential Harms**: Users should not ignore the potential harms related to toxic language, representational bias, and gender bias when deploying the model (Reference 3).
- **Real-World Deployment Without Testing**: Given that Flan-T5 has not been tested in real-world applications (Reference 5), users should not use the model in high-stakes scenarios without thorough testing and validation.

In summary, users of google/flan-t5-xxl should be cautious and responsible, ensuring that they assess and mitigate potential risks and harms before deploying the model in any application. They should also engage in continuous evaluation and research to address and reduce biases present in the model's outputs.

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The known and foreseeable issues stemming from the model google/flan-t5-xxl include:

1. **Content and Bias Risks**: Since Flan-T5 has been fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases, there is a potential risk that the model could generate inappropriate content or replicate inherent biases present in the training data (Reference 1).

2. **Misuse Potential**: There is a concern that language models like Flan-T5 can be used for harmful language generation. It is advised that Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application to prevent misuse (Reference 2).

3. **Harmful Language and Bias**: The model has been evaluated on benchmarks measuring potential harms, including toxic language, representational bias, and gender bias. However, the impact of instruction fine-tuning on these harms needs to be carefully considered, and the model should not be evaluated in isolation from the application context (References 3 and 4).

4. **Application-Specific Risks**: Downstream developers should anticipate risks specific to their application context and consider the full range of potential risks. Design decisions related to prompting, sampling, and additional mitigations such as safety filters may introduce new forms of bias and harm (Reference 5).

5. **Sensitive Use**: Flan-T5 should not be used for unacceptable use cases, such as the generation of abusive speech, to avoid contributing to societal harm (Reference 6).

6. **Instruction Fine-Tuning Effects**: While instruction fine-tuning has been shown to improve certain capabilities, such as zero-shot and few-shot learning, it is important to manually evaluate the model's responses to challenging inputs to understand its behavior in open-ended tasks (Reference 7).

7. **Generalization of Fine-Tuning**: Instruction fine-tuning has been observed to generalize across different models and architectures. However, the implications of this generalization in terms of model behavior and potential harms across different contexts are not fully understood and require further investigation (Reference 9).

In summary, while Flan-T5 exhibits strong performance on various benchmarks, it is crucial to assess and mitigate potential risks and harms, especially when deploying the model in real-world applications. This includes careful consideration of the model's content generation capabilities, biases, misuse potential, and the specific risks associated with the intended use case.

### Recommendations

Based on the provided references, here are the recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model google/flan-t5-xxl:

1. **Real-World Testing**: Before deploying Flan-T5 in real-world applications, it is crucial to conduct thorough testing to understand how the model behaves in various scenarios, as it has not been tested in real-world applications yet.

2. **Content Filtering and Bias Assessment**: Given that Flan-T5 was fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases, it is recommended to implement content filtering mechanisms and conduct bias assessments to mitigate the risk of generating inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases.

3. **Context-Specific Risk Assessment**: Developers should take appropriate measures to assess risks and potential harms in the application context before deployment. This includes evaluating the model's performance in the specific context and understanding the nuances of the application to anticipate and address potential risks.

4. **Instruction Finetuning and Harmful Outputs**: While instruction finetuning may improve zero-shot and few-shot capabilities, it is important to consider the full range of potential risks. Downstream developers should anticipate risks specific to their application context and make design decisions related to prompting, sampling, and additional mitigations, such as safety filters, to prevent new or different forms of bias and harm.

5. **Safety and Fairness Assessment**: Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application. This is to prevent the potential misuse of the model for harmful language generation.

6. **Responsible AI Benchmarks**: It is recommended to evaluate the model on Responsible AI benchmarks, particularly those measuring toxic language harms and representational bias, to ensure that the outputs are better aligned with human preferences.

7. **Evaluation on Held-Out Tasks**: To assess the model's overall capabilities on world knowledge and reasoning tasks, it is recommended to evaluate Flan-T5 on a range of different benchmarks, including multilingual ones, focusing on performance on held-out tasks that were not included as part of the fine-tuning data.

In summary, the recommendations emphasize the importance of thorough testing, bias assessment, context-specific risk assessment, and evaluation on responsible AI benchmarks to ensure the safe and fair deployment of the Flan-T5 model.

## Training Details

### Training Data

The training data for the model google/flan-t5-xxl consists of a diverse mixture of 1,836 tasks, including the Muffin, T0-SF, NIV2, and CoT datasets, which cover a range of reasoning, multi-hop reasoning, natural language inference, program synthesis, and additional tasks with instructional templates and chain-of-thought annotations to improve zero-shot and few-shot performance. [More Information Needed] on data pre-processing or additional filtering.

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing

The preprocessing for the data of the model google/flan-t5-xxl involves several steps to ensure the data is in the correct format for training the model. Here are the details based on the provided references:

1. **Tokenization**: The model likely uses the same tokenization as the original T5 models, which is based on the SentencePiece tokenizer. This tokenizer converts text into subword units that can be processed by the model. [More Information Needed] on the exact tokenization parameters or any customizations made for Flan-T5.

2. **Instructional Templates**: For the datasets Muffin, T0-SF, and NIV2, instructional templates provided by the creators of the mixtures are used. These templates format the tasks with instructions that guide the model on what is expected as an output. For the CoT (Chain-of-Thought) dataset, around ten instruction templates are manually written for each of the nine datasets included in the mixture.

3. **Few-shot Templates**: To create few-shot learning scenarios, a variety of exemplar delimiters (e.g., "Q:"/"A:") are written and applied randomly at the example level. This helps the model understand the context and the expected response format.

4. **Formatting**: The data is formatted with and without exemplars, as well as with and without Chain-of-Thought annotations, as shown in Figure 3 of the references. This formatting is crucial for the model to learn from different types of input structures.

5. **Packing**: The model uses packing (Raffel et al., 2020), which means that multiple sequences are concatenated into a single example with special tokens in between. This increases the effective batch size and helps in better utilization of the computational resources.

6. **Data Mixtures**: The model is fine-tuned on a large scale of 1,836 fine-tuning tasks by combining four mixtures from prior work: Muffin, T0-SF, NIV2, and CoT. This diverse set of tasks helps in improving the model's generalization capabilities.

7. **Hyperparameters**: While not directly related to preprocessing, it's important to note that the learning rate, batch size, and dropout are identified as the most important hyperparameters for instruction fine-tuning. The global batch size is reported, and due to packing, the effective batch size is larger.

8. **Datasets**: Before training or fine-tuning, datasets such as "wmt_t2t_translate" need to be downloaded, which implies that the data needs to be in a format compatible with the T5 library's `seqio.Task`s.

9. **Ethical Considerations**: It is mentioned that Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. This implies that the preprocessing does not include steps to filter or mitigate biases in the training data.

In summary, the preprocessing for google/flan-t5-xxl involves tokenization, the use of instructional templates, few-shot formatting, and packing of data. It is fine-tuned on a diverse set of tasks to improve generalization and does not include explicit steps for filtering or bias mitigation in the data.

- Optimizer: The Adafactor optimizer was used for finetuning.
- Packing: Multiple training examples were combined into a single sequence using packing, with an end-of-sequence token separating inputs from targets.
- Masking: Masking was applied to prevent tokens from attending to others across the packed example boundary.

The model was fine-tuned using the `t5x/train.py` script, and the finetuning procedure is referred to as Flan, which is applied across a variety of instruction template types and data sources. The compute used for finetuning is a small fraction relative to the training compute. For the `google/flan-t5-xxl` model, the exact amount of compute used for finetuning is not specified in the provided references.

#### Speeds, Sizes, Times

The model `google/flan-t5-xxl` is a part of the Flan-T5 series, which is an instruction-finetuned version of the T5 models. The XXL variant of Flan-T5 has 11 billion weights, as detailed in reference 4. This model has been fine-tuned to improve performance on a variety of tasks, including few-shot learning and open-ended question answering, as mentioned in references 10 and 11.

Regarding throughput and performance optimizations, reference 1 indicates that more examples and instructions can be found in the NVIDIA Rosetta repository, which includes support for H100 FP8 and broad GPU performance improvements. However, specific throughput details for the `google/flan-t5-xxl` model are not provided in the references, so [More Information Needed] on that front.

As for the start or end time of the model training, reference 9 mentions that the amount of compute used for finetuning is only a small fraction relative to the training compute. For example, Flan-PaLM 540B, which is a different model, used approximately 512 v4 TPU chips for 37 hours for instruction-finetuning. However, the exact start or end times for the `google/flan-t5-xxl` model are not specified, so [More Information Needed] here as well.

Checkpoint sizes are not explicitly mentioned in the provided references for the `google/flan-t5-xxl` model. Therefore, [More Information Needed] regarding checkpoint sizes.

## Evaluation

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

The model google/flan-t5-xxl evaluates on the following benchmarks or datasets:

1. MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) which includes exam questions from 57 tasks such as mathematics, history, law, and medicine.
2. TyDiQA, a question-answering benchmark across 8 typologically diverse languages.
3. MGSM (Shi et al., 2022), a multilingual benchmark of math word problems manually translated into 10 languages.

#### Factors

The foreseeable characteristics influencing the behavior of the model google/flan-t5-xxl include:

1. **Instruction Finetuning**: The model has undergone instruction finetuning, which is expected to impact its performance on benchmarks related to potential harms, such as toxic language, representational bias, and gender bias. This finetuning aims to improve the model's zero-shot and few-shot capabilities, particularly in safety classifiers (Reference 1).

2. **Contextual Application**: The model's performance cannot be fully evaluated in isolation. It is recommended that risks and potential harms be assessed in the specific context of the application before deployment. This suggests that the model's behavior may vary depending on how it is integrated and used in different environments (Reference 2).

3. **Risk Anticipation**: Downstream developers should anticipate risks specific to their application context and consider the full range of potential risks. Design decisions, such as prompting, sampling, and additional mitigations like safety filters, may introduce new forms of bias and harm (Reference 3).

4. **Performance Disaggregation**: Disaggregated analysis shows that while the model performs best on stereotypical examples, it has improved on "gotcha" examples, particularly those with "she" pronouns. This indicates that the model may be less reliant on shallow heuristics related to pronoun distributions in the training data, which could influence its behavior across different population subgroups (Reference 5).

5. **Parameter Efficiency**: The model's parameter efficiency is highlighted by its performance compared to non-finetuned models and models with a larger number of parameters. This efficiency could influence its behavior in terms of handling complex tasks and providing open-ended responses to challenging inputs (Reference 6).

6. **Evaluation Benchmarks**: The model's capabilities are evaluated on a range of benchmarks, including multilingual ones, focusing on world knowledge and reasoning tasks. The evaluation specifically avoids tasks that were part of the finetuning data to ensure a fair assessment of the model's generalization capabilities. This suggests that the model's behavior may be influenced by the domain and context of the tasks it encounters (Reference 7).

In summary, the model's behavior will be influenced by the instruction finetuning it has received, the context in which it is deployed, the design decisions made by developers, its performance on diverse examples, its parameter efficiency, and the benchmarks it is evaluated against. Evaluation should be disaggregated across factors such as domain, context, and population subgroups to uncover any disparities in performance.

#### Metrics

For the evaluation of the model google/flan-t5-xxl, we will use a "normalized average" metric as our primary evaluation measure. This metric is a macro-average over six normalized scores, which include:

1. MMLU-Direct: Direct prediction of answers on the MMLU benchmark, which includes a variety of exam questions from different domains such as mathematics, history, law, and medicine.
2. MMLU-CoT: Evaluation of the model's ability to provide a reasoning chain (Chain-of-Thought) before giving the final answer on the MMLU benchmark.
3. BBH-Direct: Direct prediction of answers on the BBH benchmark.
4. BBH-CoT: Evaluation of the model's ability to provide a reasoning chain before giving the final answer on the BBH benchmark.
5. TyDiQA-Direct: Direct prediction of answers on the TyDiQA benchmark, which is a question-answering benchmark across 8 typologically diverse languages.
6. MGSM-CoT: Evaluation of the model's ability to provide a reasoning chain before giving the final answer on the MGSM benchmark, which is a multilingual benchmark of math word problems.

These metrics are chosen to assess the model's performance on a range of tasks that require world knowledge and reasoning, and they are particularly focused on the model's ability to perform well on tasks that were not included in the finetuning data. The evaluation also includes a focus on the model's performance in multilingual contexts and its ability to generate reasoning chains, which are important for complex reasoning, planning, and explanation tasks.

The model's performance on these benchmarks will be compared with expert human raters, and the results will be reported in detail in Appendix D of our publication. Additionally, the model will be evaluated on Responsible AI benchmarks, particularly those measuring toxic language harms, to ensure that the outputs are aligned with human preferences and are safe for wider adoption.

In summary, the evaluation of google/flan-t5-xxl will involve a comprehensive set of metrics that balance the model's ability to directly predict answers with its ability to reason and explain its answers, as well as its performance across different languages and its alignment with ethical standards.

### Results

The evaluation results for the model `google/flan-t5-xxl` are as follows:

1. **Evaluation Benchmarks**: The model was evaluated on a range of benchmarks to assess its capabilities in world knowledge and reasoning tasks. These benchmarks include:
   - MMLU (Multilingual Multi-domain Language Understanding): Exam questions from 57 tasks such as mathematics, history, law, and medicine.
   - TyDiQA: A question-answering benchmark across 8 typologically diverse languages.
   - MGSM: A multilingual benchmark of math word problems manually translated into 10 languages.

2. **Evaluation Methods and Metrics**: The model was evaluated using both direct prompting and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Direct prompting involves the model directly giving the answer, while CoT prompting requires the model to provide a reasoning chain before the final answer. For TyDiQA, only direct prompting exact-match score was measured.

3. **Normalized Average Metric**: The model's performance was reported using a "normalized average" metric, which is the macro-average over six normalized scores: MMLU-Direct, MMLU-CoT, BBH-Direct, BBH-CoT, TyDiQA-Direct, and MGSM-CoT.

4. **Performance Comparison**: The Flan-T5-XXL model's performance is comparable to 540b models. It is noted that instruction finetuning improves normalized average performance by a large margin for all model types.

5. **Specific Results**: The Flan-T5-XL, which is smaller than the XXL variant, achieved a MMLU score of 52.4%, surpassing GPT-3 175B's score of 43.9%. While this information is about the XL variant, it suggests that the XXL variant, being larger, would likely perform even better, although specific numbers for the XXL variant are not provided in the reference.

6. **Impact of Instruction Finetuning**: Instruction finetuning has been shown to significantly improve the model's performance on the evaluation benchmarks. For T5 models without instruction finetuning, LM-adapted models were used for comparison.

7. **Manual Evaluation**: A manual evaluation was conducted to investigate the effect of instruction finetuning on the model's ability to give open-ended responses to challenging inputs. This involved an evaluation set of 190 examples.

8. **Translation Capabilities**: The model's translation capabilities were also evaluated, with interesting results such as translating "Es una buena médica" in Spanish into "It's a good doctor." Future analysis might analyze how instruction finetuning influences translation capabilities across languages.

For more detailed results, including specific scores and comparisons for the Flan-T5-XXL model, [More Information Needed] as the provided references do not include explicit numbers for the XXL variant.

#### Summary

The evaluation results for the model google/flan-t5-xxl indicate that instruction finetuning has significantly improved its performance across various benchmarks. The model was evaluated on a range of tasks to assess its world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, specifically avoiding benchmarks that were part of the finetuning data.

The model was tested on the MMLU benchmark, which includes exam questions from diverse subjects, and on the BBH, TyDiQA, and MGSM benchmarks, which cover reasoning, question-answering in multiple languages, and multilingual math word problems, respectively. The evaluation methods included both direct prompting and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, where the model provides a reasoning chain before the final answer.

A normalized average metric was used to report the model's performance, which is a macro-average over six normalized scores from the mentioned benchmarks. The results showed that Flan-T5-XL, a smaller variant with only 3B parameters, achieved a MMLU score of 52.4%, surpassing GPT-3 175B's score of 43.9%. This suggests that the google/flan-t5-xxl model, being larger than Flan-T5-XL, would exhibit even stronger performance.

Instruction finetuning led to substantial improvements in normalized average performance for all model types, particularly benefiting T5 models that were not originally multilingual and had been adapted through additional training on a language modeling objective. The finetuned models, including google/flan-t5-xxl, showed enhanced abilities in complex reasoning, planning, and explanation tasks, especially for CoT evaluations.

Furthermore, Flan-PaLM, which is likely related to the google/flan-t5-xxl model, demonstrated better performance on Responsible AI benchmarks, particularly in reducing toxic language harms. This aligns with findings from InstructGPT, indicating that finetuned models produce outputs more aligned with human preferences.

Overall, the google/flan-t5-xxl model, with instruction finetuning, has shown strong performance on challenging benchmarks, suggesting it is well-suited for tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and understanding in multiple languages. The model's usability in zero-shot scenarios is also highlighted, which is important for broader adoption without the need for extensive prompt engineering.

The google/flan-t5-xxl model incorporates chain-of-thought (CoT) finetuning, which is a method designed to improve the model's multi-step reasoning abilities. This approach is part of our effort to enhance the explainability of the model's outputs, as it encourages the generation of intermediate steps when solving complex tasks. By including CoT data in the instruction finetuning mixture, we have observed that the model not only performs better on traditional NLP tasks but also demonstrates an improved capacity for reasoning, planning, and explanation.

Our evaluations, including manual assessments, have shown that the model can generate more interpretable and step-by-step reasoning processes, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. This is evident in the model's performance on challenging BIG-Bench tasks, where it was prompted to "think step-by-step." The inclusion of CoT data has been crucial in achieving these results, as finetuning without it actually degraded the model's reasoning ability.

However, it is important to note that while the model's reasoning capabilities have been enhanced, the underlying data used for finetuning was not explicitly filtered for explicit content or assessed for biases. Therefore, there is a risk that the model could inadvertently generate inappropriate content or replicate biases present in the data it was trained on. Users of google/flan-t5-xxl should be aware of these limitations and exercise caution when interpreting the model's outputs, especially in sensitive applications.

In summary, the google/flan-t5-xxl model represents a step forward in explainable AI by incorporating CoT finetuning, but it also highlights the ongoing challenges in ensuring that language models are both interpretable and ethically sound. Further research and careful consideration are required to address these challenges fully.

## Technical Specification

### Model Architecture and Objective

The model `google/flan-t5-xxl` is based on the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) architecture, which is an encoder-decoder model. This model is a dense encoder-decoder model and is one of the five different sizes provided by the T5X framework, as mentioned in reference 2. Specifically, the `flan-t5-xxl` model has 11 billion weights, making it the largest in the Flan-T5 series before scaling up to the Flan-PaLM models (reference 3).

The objective of `google/flan-t5-xxl` is to perform instruction finetuning, which involves finetuning language models on a collection of datasets phrased as instructions. This approach has been shown to improve model performance and generalization to unseen tasks (reference 6). Instruction finetuning is a general method that enhances the performance and usability of pretrained language models (reference 7).

The model has been fine-tuned on a variety of tasks and has shown strong few-shot performance even when compared to much larger models (reference 8). It is an improved implementation of the original T5 codebase, utilizing JAX and Flax for better performance and scalability (reference 9).

The `google/flan-t5-xxl` model benefits significantly from instruction finetuning, especially given the difficulty of the evaluation benchmarks and the fact that the original T5 is not multilingual (reference 10). Instruction finetuning has been applied across models with different architectures, sizes, and pre-training objectives, demonstrating its generality and effectiveness (reference 11).

### Compute Infrastructure

The compute infrastructure used for the model `google/flan-t5-xxl` includes the following:

1. The model can be run on GPUs in both single-node and multi-node configurations, with support for a SLURM+pyxis cluster, as detailed in the T5X documentation and example scripts found in the `t5x/contrib/gpu` directory on GitHub.

2. For fine-tuning, the model utilizes a fraction of the compute compared to pre-training. For instance, instruction fine-tuning Flan-PaLM 540B, which is a larger model, required approximately 512 v4 TPU chips for 37 hours, which is only 0.2% of the pre-training compute.

3. The model can also benefit from GPU optimizations for improved throughput, with more examples and instructions available in the NVIDIA Rosetta repository, which includes support for H100 FP8 and broad GPU performance improvements.

4. The JAX-based T5X framework is used for training, which allows for efficient utilization of the compute resources.

5. The model can be run with XManager on Vertex AI, which simplifies the process of creating TPU instances and managing their lifecycle, including automatic shutdown post-job termination.

6. The checkpoints for T5 models, including variants in T5X format for maximal efficiency, are available, which suggests that the infrastructure also involves converting Mesh TensorFlow checkpoints for use with T5X.

For specific details such as the exact number of TPUs or GPUs, batch sizes, learning rates, and other hyperparameters used for the `google/flan-t5-xxl` model, [More Information Needed] as these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided references.
