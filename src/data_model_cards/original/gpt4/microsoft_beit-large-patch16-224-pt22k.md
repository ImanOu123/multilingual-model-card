# Model Card for microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k

The model microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k is a large-scale vision Transformer that employs a self-supervised pre-training strategy, using masked image modeling to predict discrete visual tokens from corrupted image patches, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet without extra data. It represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision by adapting principles from natural language processing to image understanding tasks.

## Model Details

### Model Description

Model Name: microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k

### Model Architecture:
The architecture of the BEIT (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers) large model is based on the standard vision Transformer (ViT) design. It processes input as a sequence of image patches, which are linearly projected to patch embeddings. A special token [S] is prepended to the input sequence, and learnable 1D position embeddings are added to the patch embeddings. The model employs a Transformer encoder with multiple layers to generate encoded representations for the image patches.

Key architectural enhancements include LayerScale and relative position bias, which have been shown to improve performance on tasks such as ImageNet classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation. However, LayerScale is not used for extra-large models due to stability considerations when scaling up to billions of parameters.

### Training Procedures:
The BEIT-large model is pretrained on the ImageNet-22k dataset. The pretraining involves a masked image modeling task, where some image patches are randomly masked, and the model aims to recover the original visual tokens from the corrupted image patches. The pretraining objective is inspired by BERT from the NLP domain.

The base-size models are pretrained for 300 epochs on ImageNet-1K, following the same settings as in the ablation studies. For large-scale pretraining, proper initialization is crucial for stabilizing the Transformer, which includes random initialization within a small range and rescaling the output matrices of the Transformer layers.

### Parameters:
The model uses a large-scale Transformer architecture with a significant number of parameters, although the exact number is not specified in the provided references. The initialization range for parameters is mentioned to be within [-0.02, 0.02], and a specific rescaling technique is applied to the output matrices of the Transformer layers.

### Important Disclaimers:
- The model's performance improvements with LayerScale and relative position bias are not applicable to extra-large models due to stability issues.
- Proper initialization is important for the stability of the Transformer, especially during large-scale pretraining.
- The model's effectiveness tends to be greater for larger models and when labeled data are insufficient for supervised pretraining.
- The detailed instructions to reproduce the results and the fine-tuned weights and logs are provided separately.

## Uses

### Direct Use

The model `microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k` can be used in a self-supervised manner without fine-tuning for tasks that require understanding the visual content of an image. Since the model has been pre-trained on ImageNet-22k with the masked image modeling (MIM) task, it can generate contextualized vector representations of image patches.

For example, you could use the model to extract features from images, which could then be used for various unsupervised tasks such as clustering or nearest neighbor search. The model outputs a vector representation for each image patch, and these representations can be aggregated to form a global representation of the image.

Here's a conceptual code snippet on how you might use the model to extract features from an image without fine-tuning:

```python
from transformers import BeitModel, BeitFeatureExtractor
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests

# Load pre-trained BEiT model
model = BeitModel.from_pretrained('microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k')

# Initialize the feature extractor
feature_extractor = BeitFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k')

# Load an image from the web
url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

# Preprocess the image and prepare for the model
inputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

# Extract features
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Get the last hidden states
last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state

# The `last_hidden_states` can be used as a feature representation of the input image
```

Please note that the above code is a conceptual example. The actual usage might require specific versions of libraries or additional context from the model's documentation or the Hugging Face model repository. If you need to perform a specific task without fine-tuning, such as image classification or semantic segmentation, you would typically need to fine-tune the model on a labeled dataset for that task. However, for unsupervised tasks or feature extraction, the model can be used as is, without further training.

### Downstream Use

The `microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k` model is a large-scale self-supervised pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned for various downstream vision tasks such as image classification and semantic segmentation. The model has been pre-trained on the ImageNet-22k dataset and can be adapted to specific tasks by adding a task-specific layer on top of the Transformer and fine-tuning the entire model.

For image classification tasks, a simple linear classifier is used as the task layer. The process involves using average pooling to aggregate the representations from the image patches and then feeding the pooled representation to a softmax classifier to compute the category probabilities.

For semantic segmentation, the model uses pretrained BEIT as a backbone encoder and incorporates several deconvolution layers as a decoder to produce segmentation maps. The model is end-to-end fine-tuned in a manner similar to image classification.

When integrating `microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k` into a larger ecosystem or app, the model can serve as a powerful feature extractor for images, where the extracted features can be used for various applications such as object detection, content-based image retrieval, or even more complex systems like autonomous driving or medical image analysis.

Here's a conceptual code snippet for fine-tuning the model on an image classification task, assuming that the necessary libraries and the `get_started_for_image_classification.md` guide are available for detailed instructions:

```python
from transformers import BeitForImageClassification
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

# Load the pre-trained BEIT model
model = BeitForImageClassification.from_pretrained('microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k')

# Load your dataset
datasets = load_dataset('your_dataset_name')

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The model microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k, as a state-of-the-art deep learning model for image classification and semantic segmentation, has several known or foreseeable issues that can be categorized into technical and sociotechnical limitations:

1. **Dependency on Large-Scale Pretraining Data**: As indicated in references 9 and 10, BEIT models, especially larger ones, benefit significantly from pretraining on large datasets like ImageNet-22K. This dependency on extensive labeled datasets can be a limitation, as it may not generalize well to tasks with limited or no labeled data. Moreover, the creation and maintenance of such large datasets require substantial resources and may introduce biases if the data is not representative.

2. **Computational Resources**: Scaling up BEIT to larger sizes, as mentioned in reference 10, requires significant computational resources. This can limit the accessibility of the model to researchers and practitioners with fewer resources, potentially widening the gap between well-funded organizations and others.

3. **Potential for Bias**: While not explicitly mentioned in the references, any machine learning model, including BEIT, can inherit biases present in the training data. Given that BEIT is trained on ImageNet-22K, it may perpetuate any biases present in that dataset. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes when the model is applied in real-world scenarios.

4. **Misunderstandings of Model Capabilities**: The high performance of BEIT on benchmarks like ImageNet, as stated in reference 11, might lead to overestimation of its capabilities. Users might expect the model to perform equally well in all scenarios, which is not always the case, especially in domains or tasks that differ significantly from the pretraining data.

5. **Short-Distance Dependency**: Reference 3 discusses how blockwise masking helps relieve the suffering of short-distance dependency in pixel-level auto-encoding. This suggests that the model may struggle with understanding long-range dependencies within an image, which could be a limitation for certain tasks.

6. **Model Interpretability**: The self-attention maps discussed in reference 4 provide some insight into the model's focus within an image. However, deep learning models, in general, are often criticized for their lack of interpretability. Understanding the model's decision-making process is crucial for trust and accountability, especially in sensitive applications.

7. **Adaptability to Different Domains**: The model's performance is evaluated on specific tasks like image classification and semantic segmentation. Its adaptability to other domains or tasks that were not part of the evaluation is not guaranteed and may require additional fine-tuning or modifications.

8. **Future Work on Multimodal Pretraining**: Reference 6 suggests plans to conduct multimodal pretraining. While this is a potential improvement, it also introduces complexity and the possibility of new unforeseen issues, particularly in how different modalities interact and the biases that may arise from multimodal datasets.

In conclusion, while the microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k model shows impressive performance, it is important to consider these technical and sociotechnical limitations when deploying the model in real-world applications. Users should be aware of the potential biases, the need for computational resources, and the limitations in generalizability and interpretability.

### Recommendations

As a sociotechnic involved in the development of the `microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k` model, my recommendations with respect to foreseeable issues are as follows:

1. **Bias and Fairness**: Given the model's state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, it is crucial to consider the diversity of the dataset. ImageNet-22k may not represent the global population adequately. We recommend conducting bias and fairness assessments to ensure the model does not perpetuate or amplify societal biases. This includes evaluating the model across diverse demographic groups and scenarios.

2. **Environmental Impact**: The pre-training and fine-tuning of large models like BEIT-large require significant computational resources, as indicated by the use of a DGX-2 box with 16 V100-32GB GPUs. We recommend transparent reporting of the carbon footprint associated with training and encourage research into more energy-efficient training methods.

3. **Data Privacy and Ethics**: The model's pre-training on ImageNet-22k, which contains a wide variety of images, may raise concerns about data privacy and the use of potentially sensitive or personal images. We recommend a thorough review of the dataset to ensure that it complies with privacy standards and does not contain inappropriate content.

4. **Robustness and Generalization**: While the model achieves high accuracy on ImageNet, it is important to assess its performance on other datasets and real-world scenarios to ensure robustness and generalization. We recommend extensive testing and validation on diverse datasets to identify and mitigate any performance drops or failure modes.

5. **Dependency on External Libraries**: The model repository is built using external libraries such as `timm`, `DeiT`, and `Dino`. We recommend ensuring that these dependencies are maintained and kept up-to-date to prevent potential security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.

6. **Scalability and Accessibility**: The improvements in performance with larger model sizes suggest that BEIT benefits from scaling up. However, this may limit the accessibility of the model for researchers and practitioners with fewer resources. We recommend exploring strategies to democratize access to the model, such as providing smaller, more efficient variants or cloud-based APIs.

7. **Multimodal Pre-Training**: The intention to conduct multimodal pre-training in a unified way raises questions about the integration of different data types and the ethical considerations of combining text and image data. We recommend establishing clear guidelines and ethical standards for multimodal data usage.

8. **Long-Term Societal Impact**: As the model influences the field of computer vision and potentially other domains, it is important to consider the long-term societal impact, including the potential for misuse in surveillance or other applications that may infringe on individual rights. We recommend proactive engagement with policymakers, ethicists, and civil society to guide the responsible use of the technology.

In conclusion, while the `microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k` model represents a significant advancement in image classification and semantic segmentation, it is imperative to address the aforementioned recommendations to ensure its responsible development, deployment, and use.

## Training Details

### Training Data

The training data for the model `microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k` is the ImageNet-22k dataset, which does not include any additional data for pre-training. For details on data pre-processing and filtering, please refer to the [BEiT GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/beit) and the associated [preprint paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08254).

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing

The preprocessing for the data of the model `microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k` involves several steps to prepare the images for the masked image modeling (MIM) task. Here's a detailed description of the preprocessing steps:

1. **Tokenization of Images**: As per our method, we treat images similarly to how text is treated in natural language processing. We tokenize the image into a sequence of discrete visual tokens. This is done by first splitting the image into a grid of patches and then converting these patches into visual tokens. The tokenization process involves splitting the 2D image into a sequence of `N` image patches, where each patch is of size `P x P` pixels. The number of patches `N` is determined by the formula `N = HW / P^2`, where `H` and `W` are the height and width of the input image, and `P` is the resolution of each patch. In our case, the image is tokenized into a `14 x 14` grid, which corresponds to `196` visual tokens, with a vocabulary size `|V|` of `8192`.

2. **Masking of Image Patches**: During pre-training, we randomly mask approximately 40% of the image patches. The number of masked patches is specified by the `--num_mask_patches` argument, which is set to `75` in our pre-training script. The masked positions are denoted by `M`, and we replace these masked patches with a learnable embedding `e[M]`.

3. **Corrupted Image Patches**: After masking, the corrupted image patches `xM` are created by combining the unmasked patches `xpi` with the learnable embedding for the masked positions. These corrupted patches are then fed into the Transformer model.

4. **Resizing and Normalization**: The input images are resized to `224 x 224` pixels, as indicated by the model name `patch16-224`. This resizing ensures that the images are of a consistent size suitable for the model. Additionally, if the `--imagenet_default_mean_and_std` flag is used, as shown in the second pre-training script, the images are normalized using the default mean and standard deviation values from ImageNet.

5. **Linear Projection**: The image patches are flattened into vectors and linearly projected, similar to word embeddings in BERT. This step is necessary to convert the raw pixel values of the patches into a format that can be processed by the Transformer model.

6. **Required Packages**: The preprocessing steps require specific versions of packages such as PyTorch, torchvision, and Timm. For mixed-precision training, the `apex` package is also required.

In summary, the preprocessing for `microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k` involves tokenizing images into visual tokens, masking a portion of the image patches, creating corrupted image patches, resizing and normalizing the images, and linearly projecting the patches to prepare them for the MIM task during pre-training.

## Evaluation

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

The model microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k evaluates on the following benchmarks or datasets:

1. ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset with 1k classes and 1.3M images for image classification tasks, as mentioned in reference 4.
2. Semantic segmentation tasks, although the specific datasets for semantic segmentation are not mentioned in the provided references, it is common to use datasets like PASCAL VOC, ADE20K, or Cityscapes for such tasks. Reference 8 mentions following the task layer used in SETR-PUP for semantic segmentation, which suggests that similar datasets might be used for evaluation.

[More Information Needed] for any additional benchmarks or datasets not covered in the provided references.

#### Factors

The model microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k is a deep learning model that has been pre-trained on a large dataset (ImageNet-22K) and is designed for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Based on the provided references, the following characteristics are foreseeable that will influence how the model behaves:

1. **Domain and Context**: The model has been evaluated on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, specifically on datasets like ImageNet and ADE20K. Therefore, its performance is expected to be optimal within these domains. For other domains or contexts, such as medical imaging or satellite imagery, the model's performance may not be as strong without further fine-tuning or adaptation.

2. **Blockwise Masking**: The model employs blockwise masking during pre-training, which has been shown to be beneficial, especially for semantic segmentation. This suggests that the model may perform better on tasks that benefit from understanding larger, contiguous regions of an image, as opposed to tasks that require fine-grained pixel-level predictions.

3. **Visual Tokens Prediction**: The prediction of visual tokens, rather than raw pixels, is a key ingredient of the model's design. This indicates that the model is likely to perform better on tasks where understanding the semantic content of the image is more important than reconstructing exact pixel values.

4. **Initialization and Scaling**: Proper initialization and scaling of the Transformer layers are important for the model's performance. This suggests that the model's behavior is sensitive to the initialization scheme, and care should be taken when adapting or extending the model to ensure stability.

5. **Intermediate Fine-tuning**: The model benefits from intermediate fine-tuning on a data-rich dataset like ImageNet-1K before being fine-tuned on target downstream tasks. This step is crucial for achieving competitive results and suggests that the model's performance can be significantly influenced by the quality and quantity of data available for intermediate fine-tuning.

6. **Model Size and Data Sufficiency**: The model's performance improves with scaling, and BEIT tends to help more for extremely larger models, especially when labeled data are insufficient for supervised pre-training. This implies that the model's behavior will be more advantageous in scenarios where large-scale models can be leveraged and labeled data is scarce.

7. **Population Subgroups**: [More Information Needed] The provided references do not explicitly discuss the model's performance across different population subgroups. To understand disparities in performance, further evaluation would be needed, ideally disaggregated across factors such as demographics in the dataset, to uncover any biases or limitations in the model's applicability to various subgroups.

In summary, the model's behavior is influenced by its pre-training on blockwise masking and visual tokens prediction, its domain-specific performance, the importance of proper initialization and scaling, the benefits of intermediate fine-tuning, and its potential for larger-scale applications. However, more information is needed to assess its performance across different population subgroups.

#### Metrics

The primary metric used for evaluating the model microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k is top-1 accuracy on image classification, as mentioned in reference 3. This metric is particularly relevant for the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset, which consists of 1k classes and 1.3M images, as stated in reference 5.

In terms of tradeoffs between different errors, the model card should discuss how the model performs in comparison to other models and under different conditions. For instance, reference 1 highlights the benefits of scaling up from the base to the large model, which suggests that the large model may be more robust when dealing with insufficient labeled data for supervised pre-training. Additionally, reference 4 discusses the benefits of blockwise masking and the use of visual tokens over naive pixel-level auto-encoding, which could be relevant when considering the tradeoffs between different pre-training strategies.

However, for a more detailed discussion on the tradeoffs between different types of errors (e.g., false positives vs. false negatives), or how the model performs on other datasets or under domain shift, [More Information Needed] would be the appropriate response, as the provided references do not give specific insights into these aspects.

6. **Data Efficiency**: The results suggest that BEiT is particularly beneficial for extremely large models, especially when labeled data are insufficient for conducting supervised pre-training (Reference 2).

7. **Pre-training Task**: BEiT employs a masked image modeling task, which significantly outperforms the pixel regression problem in recovering masked patches (Reference 6).

In summary, the `microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k` model exhibits excellent performance on the ImageNet-1K dataset, with state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy and benefits from scaling up and self-supervised pre-training on ImageNet-22K. The model also incorporates architectural improvements and a novel pre-training task that contributes to its effectiveness in image classification.

#### Summary

The model microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks. Specifically, it achieved a top-1 accuracy of 88.6% on the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset, which consists of 1k classes and 1.3M images. This result is notable as it was achieved without using any extra data beyond the ImageNet-22k dataset.

The BEIT-large model benefits from scaling up from the base to the large size, showing greater improvements compared to supervised pre-training with ImageNet-22K. For instance, BEIT-Large outperforms its base counterpart by 2.0, and when the resolution is increased to 384x384, BEIT-Large achieves a 1.7 improvement over BEIT with the same resolution. This suggests that BEIT is particularly effective for larger models and when labeled data for supervised pre-training are scarce.

The model uses a pre-training strategy that involves masking some image patches and then predicting the original visual tokens based on these corrupted patches. This approach has been shown to be beneficial, especially when compared to naive pixel-level auto-encoding, and it also aids in semantic segmentation tasks.

For fine-tuning, the model follows most of the hyperparameters from DeiT and uses a larger learning rate with layer-wise decay, reducing the number of fine-tuning epochs due to the benefits of pre-training.

In summary, the microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k model is a highly effective model for image classification, benefiting from its large size and pre-training strategy, and achieving top-tier results on the ImageNet dataset without the need for additional data.

## Model Examination

### Model Card - Experimental Section: Explainability/Interpretability

#### Self-Attention Visualization

Our BEIT model demonstrates an intrinsic capability for understanding semantic regions within an image. As evidenced in our self-attention map visualizations (Reference 1), the model's attention mechanism can distinguish between different semantic parts of an image without any task-specific supervision. This is a crucial aspect of our model's interpretability, as it provides insights into how BEIT processes and recognizes various features within an image. The attention maps are generated by computing the query-key product in the last layer of the network, offering a window into the model's internal representations.

#### Pre-Training Objectives and Visual Token Reconstruction

The pre-training of BEIT can be likened to the training of a variational autoencoder (Reference 3). The model learns to reconstruct an original image from a corrupted version by predicting visual tokens, which serve as a compact representation of the image's content. This process is formalized in our pre-training objective, which includes a term for visual token reconstruction (Reference 2). By optimizing this objective, BEIT learns to capture the essence of the visual content, which is a step towards explainability as it aligns the model's internal representations with human-understandable visual tokens.

#### Masked Image Modeling (MIM)

Inspired by the success of masked language modeling in NLP, our MIM task applies a similar approach to visual data (Reference 7). By predicting the content of masked patches, BEIT learns to understand the context and content of images. This approach is superior to pixel-level auto-encoding, which tends to focus on short-range dependencies and high-frequency details, as it encourages the model to capture more abstract and semantically meaningful representations (Reference 7).

#### Ablation Studies

Our ablation studies (Reference 6) provide further insights into the model's interpretability. We demonstrate that blockwise masking and the use of visual tokens are beneficial for the model's performance on tasks like semantic segmentation. This suggests that the model's ability to understand and represent images is enhanced by these pre-training strategies, which in turn improves its interpretability.

#### Scaling and Performance

The scaling of BEIT from base to large models shows significant improvements over supervised pre-training methods, especially when labeled data are scarce (Reference 8). This indicates that BEIT's self-supervised learning approach, which does not rely on manual annotations, can lead to more generalizable and potentially more interpretable models as they scale.

#### Code for Analysis

For those interested in further analysis of the self-attention mechanism and other interpretability aspects of BEIT, the code is grouped in the BEiTv2 Repo (Reference 4). This repository provides the necessary tools for researchers and practitioners to explore and understand the inner workings of the model.

In conclusion, the interpretability of the BEIT model is rooted in its self-attention mechanism, pre-training objectives, and the ability to learn semantic representations without manual annotations. Our experimental results and ablation studies provide evidence of the model's capability to capture meaningful visual information, which is a step towards explainability in deep learning models for vision.

## Technical Specification

### Model Architecture and Objective

The model architecture of `microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k` is based on the standard vision Transformer (ViT) as the backbone network, which allows for direct comparison with previous work in terms of network architecture [4]. The input to the Transformer is a sequence of image patches that are linearly projected to obtain patch embeddings, with a special token [S] prepended to the input sequence and standard learnable 1D position embeddings added to the patch embeddings [3]. The encoder consists of L layers of Transformer blocks [3]. The model scales up to a large size, similar to ViT-L, and incorporates improvements such as LayerScale and relative position bias, which have been shown to improve performance on tasks like ImageNet classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation [1]. However, LayerScale is not used for extra-large models due to stability considerations when scaling up to billions of parameters [1].

The objective of the `microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k` model is to perform self-supervised pre-training using a masked image modeling task, inspired by BERT's approach in natural language processing [7]. During pre-training, some image patches are randomly masked and fed into the backbone Transformer, with the goal of recovering the original visual tokens from the corrupted image patches [6, 11]. After pre-training, the model can be directly fine-tuned on downstream tasks by appending task-specific layers to the pretrained encoder [6]. The model also supports intermediate fine-tuning on a data-rich dataset like ImageNet-1K before being fine-tuned on the target downstream tasks [8]. Experimental results have shown that the model achieves competitive results with previous pre-training methods on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks [6].
