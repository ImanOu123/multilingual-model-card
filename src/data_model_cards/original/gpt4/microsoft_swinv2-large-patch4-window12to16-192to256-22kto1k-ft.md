1. **Model Scaling and Training Stability**: The Swin Transformer V2 has been designed with techniques such as res-post-norm and scaled cosine attention to stabilize training and allow for scaling up the model capacity. It is recommended to utilize these techniques as they have been shown to prevent activation values from exploding in deeper layers, which is particularly important for large models.

2. **Memory Optimization**: For training large models on very high-resolution images, it is recommended to use sequential self-attention computation and activation checkpointing. These optimizations help alleviate the memory bottleneck caused by the self-attention module and feature maps in Transformer layers, respectively. However, be aware that activation checkpointing may slow down the training speed by up to 30%.

3. **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: The model has been pre-trained on ImageNet-22K with specific settings such as a batch size of 4096 and an initial learning rate of 0.001. It is recommended to follow these settings for pre-training and employ similar augmentation and regularization strategies like RandAugment, Mixup, Cutmix, and random erasing for optimal performance.

4. **Data and Model Scaling**: The release of various Swin and SwinV2 models pre-trained using the SimMIM approach provides a range of model sizes and data sizes for experimentation. It is recommended to leverage these models to study the properties of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) methods and refer to the data scaling paper for more details on scaling strategies.

5. **Position Bias Computation**: When scaling up the window resolution, it is important to consider different position bias computation approaches. The log-spaced continuous relative position bias approach has been found effective for transferring the model across different window resolutions.

6. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Continuous monitoring of the model's performance across different image and window resolutions is recommended. This includes evaluating the top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K and other relevant benchmarks to ensure the model's effectiveness when applied to larger image/window resolutions.

7. **Ethical and Societal Considerations**: As a sociotechnic, it is crucial to consider the broader impact of deploying this model. This includes assessing the potential for bias in the training data, the environmental impact of training large-scale models, and the implications of the model's use in various applications. It is recommended to conduct thorough ethical reviews and bias assessments, and to provide clear documentation on the model's intended use cases and limitations.

The model was pre-trained with an input resolution of 192x192 and fine-tuned on ImageNet-1K, a subset with approximately 1 million images and 1,000 categories, using larger input resolutions ranging from 192x192 to 256x256. For more details on data pre-processing and additional filtering, please refer to the provided [config](configs/swinv2/swinv2_large_patch4_window12_192_22k.yaml) and the associated documentation on the [github](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/storage/releases/download/v2.0.0/swinv2_large_patch4_window12_192_22k.pth) repository.

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps for the data used in the model `microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft` involve several key procedures to ensure the input data is compatible with the model architecture and can leverage its capabilities effectively. Here's a detailed description of the preprocessing steps:

1. **Image Resizing**: The input images are resized to fit the model's input resolution requirements. For this model, the image sizes range from 192 to 256 pixels, which aligns with the model's name indicating it can handle variable input resolutions (`192to256`). This resizing ensures that the images are compatible with the patch sizes and window sizes used within the model.

2. **Patch Extraction**: The images are divided into patches. The model uses a patch size of 4, as indicated by `patch4` in the model name. These patches are then linearly embedded before being fed into the Transformer encoder.

3. **Window Partitioning**: The model employs a hierarchical Transformer with shifted windows, as described in reference 7. The window sizes vary from 12 to 16, as indicated by `window12to16` in the model name. This means during the forward pass, the model will dynamically adjust the window sizes for computing self-attention, which helps in managing computational resources and capturing local context effectively.

4. **Positional Encoding**: The model uses log-spaced coordinates for transferring relative position biases across different window resolutions, as mentioned in references 4 and 6. This approach helps in reducing the extrapolation ratio when scaling the window sizes, which is crucial for the model's ability to generalize across different image resolutions.

5. **Normalization**: As per reference 8, the model adopts a layer norm layer at the beginning of each block. This is important for stabilizing the training of deep networks and is a common practice in Transformer architectures.

6. **Activation Checkpointing**: To manage GPU memory consumption, especially when dealing with high-resolution images and large window sizes, activation checkpointing is used as described in reference 2. This technique trades off training speed for memory efficiency, allowing the model to be trained on hardware with limited memory without running out of resources.

7. **Sequential Self-Attention Computation**: For very large resolutions, the model implements self-attention computation sequentially to alleviate the bottleneck caused by the self-attention module, as mentioned in reference 5. This optimization allows training on large image resolutions that would otherwise be unaffordable on regular GPUs.

For specific instructions on how to apply these preprocessing steps, users are referred to the `get_started.md` for image classification, and the respective GitHub repositories for object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, self-supervised learning, and video recognition, as indicated in references 1 and 3.

#### Summary

The model `microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft` has demonstrated strong performance in various benchmarks. Specifically, on the ADE20K semantic segmentation benchmark, it achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 59.9, which is 1.5 points higher than the previous best result of 58.4. This improvement suggests that scaling up the vision model is beneficial for pixel-level vision recognition tasks. Additionally, using a larger window size at test time can lead to a further gain of +0.2 mIoU, likely due to the effective Log-spaced Continuous Positional Bias (CPB) approach.

For the ImageNet-1K-V2 classification task, the SwinV2-L variant of the model with an input resolution of 384x384 achieved an accuracy of 78.31% at top-1, indicating its high performance in image classification as well.

However, there are noted challenges when scaling up the model capacity and window resolution. Directly testing the accuracy of a pre-trained ImageNet-1K model with larger image resolutions and window sizes through bi-cubic interpolation has shown a significant decrease in performance. This suggests that the relative position bias approach in the original Swin Transformer may need to be re-examined.

Lastly, the model is part of a series of Swin and SwinV2 models pre-trained using the SimMIM approach, which offers a range of model sizes and data sizes for further research into the properties of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) methods.

#### Explainability/Interpretability

Our Swin Transformer V2 (SwinV2) model, specifically the `microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft`, incorporates several advancements that contribute to its improved performance and stability, particularly in larger model sizes. These advancements also provide insights into the model's interpretability:

1. **Post-Norm and Scaled Cosine Attention**: We have implemented a combination of res-post-norm and scaled cosine attention mechanisms that stabilize the training of the model. This is particularly evident in larger models, where the activation values at deeper layers exhibit much milder behavior compared to the original Swin Transformer, preventing the explosion of activation values (Reference 1). This stability is crucial for the interpretability of the model as it ensures that the model's behavior remains consistent and predictable across different layers and model sizes.

2. **Relative Position Bias Matrices Visualization**: The model learns relative position bias matrices, which are visualized in Figure 4 (Reference 2). These visualizations show how the model's attention mechanism adapts to different input image sizes and window sizes, providing an understanding of how the model captures spatial relationships within the data. This insight into the model's learned biases can be a step towards explaining the model's predictions based on spatial relationships.

3. **Ablation Studies**: Ablation studies on the res-post-norm and scaled cosine attention approaches show that both techniques improve accuracy across various model sizes (Reference 3). This indicates that the model's performance gains can be attributed to these specific architectural changes, which can be helpful when interpreting the model's behavior and understanding the contribution of each component.

4. **Position Bias Approach**: The model employs a relative position bias approach, which is more common in computer vision due to the importance of spatial relationships in visual modeling (Reference 4). Understanding how the model encodes and utilizes positional information can provide insights into its interpretability, especially when compared to absolute position embedding.

5. **Resolution Changes and Position Bias**: The model benefits from the proposed log-spaced continuous position bias (CPB) approach, especially when there is a large change in resolutions between pre-training and fine-tuning (Reference 5). This adaptability to resolution changes can be a factor in explaining the model's robustness and performance in various settings.

6. **Shifted Window Scheme**: The Swin Transformer's shifted windowing scheme is a key feature that allows for efficient computation of self-attention in non-overlapping local windows while enabling cross-window connections (Reference 6). This design choice is central to the model's interpretability as it directly affects how the model processes and integrates local and global information.

7. **Scaling Model Capacity and Window Resolution**: We observe that scaling up the model capacity and window resolution leads to improved performance in dense vision recognition tasks (Reference 7). However, the diminishing returns at larger sizes suggest that additional strategies may be needed. Understanding these scaling issues can inform the interpretability of the model's performance limits and the necessity for more data or advanced methods.

In summary, the `microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft` model's design and empirical results provide several avenues for explainability and interpretability. The visualization of learned biases, the impact of architectural choices on performance, and the model's adaptability to resolution changes all contribute to a deeper understanding of how the model processes visual information and makes predictions.
