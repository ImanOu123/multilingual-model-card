This model is pre-trained on the BigPatent dataset, which comprises patent documents, making it particularly suited for summarization tasks in the legal and patent domain.\n\nThe BigBird architecture introduces a sparse attention mechanism that allows it to handle sequences significantly longer than what is possible with the standard Transformer models like BERT or Pegasus. While traditional Transformer models use full self-attention where each token attends to every other token, leading to quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length, BigBird utilizes a combination of random, window, and global attention mechanisms to reduce this complexity to linear.\n\nIn the BigBird model, the random attention ensures that each token attends to a random set of other tokens, providing a way to capture long-range dependencies. The window attention allows for attending to neighboring tokens, which is similar to local attention patterns. The global attention is applied to important tokens such as [CLS], [SEP], or other task-specific tokens that are crucial for understanding the overall context or structure of the document.\n\nThe `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model inherits these characteristics and is fine-tuned on the BigPatent dataset, which consists of diverse patent documents. The Pegasus part of the model's name indicates that it is designed for abstractive summarization, where the model generates coherent and concise summaries that may include novel sentences not found in the source text. The Pegasus model is pre-trained with a self-supervised objective called gap-sentence generation, where certain sentences are masked in the input document, and the model learns to predict these sentences, which helps it to learn summarization implicitly.\n\nIn summary, `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a large-scale Transformer model optimized for long document processing, with a sparse attention mechanism that allows it to efficiently handle the extensive context found in patent documents, and it is fine-tuned for the task of abstractive summarization on the BigPatent dataset.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an adaptation of the PEGASUS model, fine-tuned specifically for the task of summarization on the BIGPATENT dataset. The BIGPATENT dataset comprises a large collection of patent documents, making it an ideal training ground for a model intended to generate summaries of long and complex documents.\n\nHere are some basic details about the training procedures for such a model:\n\n1. **Pre-training**: The BigBird model, like PEGASUS, is pre-trained on a large corpus of text. This pre-training involves self-supervised learning, where the model is trained to predict masked tokens in the input, helping it to understand the context and semantics of the language.\n\n2. **Architecture**: BigBird extends the Transformer architecture by incorporating sparse attention mechanisms. This allows the model to handle longer sequences of text efficiently, which is crucial for summarizing lengthy patent documents.\n\n3. **Fine-tuning**: After pre-training, the model is fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset. During fine-tuning, the model's parameters are adjusted to better perform the specific task of summarization. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, and the model is trained to generate accurate and coherent summaries of the patent documents.\n\n4. **Objective**: The fine-tuning process typically uses a sequence-to-sequence learning objective, where the input is a long document and the output is a shorter summary. The model is trained to minimize the difference between its generated summaries and the human-written abstracts provided in the BIGPATENT dataset.\n\n5. **Optimization**: The training process involves using an optimizer such as Adam or Adafactor, with a learning rate schedule that may include warm-up steps and learning rate decay to improve convergence.\n\n6. **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout are used to prevent overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\n7. **Evaluation**: Throughout the training process, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set to monitor its ability to generate summaries. Metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) are used to assess the quality of the summaries.\n\n8. **Computational Resources**: Training such a large model requires significant computational resources, often involving the use of multiple GPUs or TPUs to handle the large number of parameters and the long sequences of text.\n\n9. **Post-training Adjustments**: After the initial fine-tuning, additional adjustments might be made based on the performance on the validation set, such as tweaking hyperparameters or further training with a reduced learning rate.\n\nBy following these training procedures, the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model is tailored to generate concise and informative summaries of patent documents, capturing the essence of complex technical information in a more digestible form.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an adaptation of the PEGASUS model, fine-tuned specifically for the task of summarization on the BIGPATENT dataset. The BIGPATENT dataset comprises patent documents, and the model is optimized to generate abstractive summaries of these documents.\n\nHere are some basic details about the parameters of the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model:\n\n1. **Model Architecture**: BigBird is a sparse-attention-based transformer that extends the standard Transformer model by incorporating sparse attention mechanisms. This allows it to handle longer sequences of data, which is particularly useful for tasks like summarization of lengthy documents such as patents.\n\n2. **Parameter Count**: The \"large\" in the model name suggests that it has a significant number of parameters. While the exact number of parameters for this specific model is not provided, the original BigBird model has around 400 million parameters, and PEGASUS models typically have a similar scale of parameters. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` has several hundred million parameters.\n\n3. **Attention Mechanism**: The model uses a combination of global, window, and random sparse attention patterns to efficiently process long documents while maintaining the ability to capture both local and global dependencies in the text.\n\n4. **Fine-tuning**: The model has been fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset, which means its parameters have been adjusted from the pre-trained state to better perform the summarization task on patent literature.\n\n5. **Input and Output**: The model is designed to take a long sequence of text as input and produce a concise, coherent summary as output. The input sequence length and output length can vary, but BigBird models are capable of handling sequences much longer than the standard Transformer models.\n\n6. **Pre-training**: Before fine-tuning on the BIGPATENT dataset, the model was pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. During pre-training, it learned a general understanding of language, which was then specialized to the domain of patent summarization.\n\n7. **Tokenizer**: The model uses a tokenizer to convert text into tokens that can be processed by the neural network. The tokenizer is an important part of the model's parameters as it defines the vocabulary and how text is broken down into manageable pieces.\n\nTo use this model effectively, one would typically access it through the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides APIs for easy interaction with pre-trained models like `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent`. Users can leverage the model for generating summaries of patent documents without needing to train the model from scratch, taking advantage of its specialized capabilities for this domain.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the PEGASUS model, fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset. This model is designed for tasks such as summarization, particularly focusing on long documents like patents. However, when using this model, it is important to consider several disclaimers:\n\n1. **Training Data Limitations**: The model has been trained on the BIGPATENT dataset, which consists of patent documents. Its performance may not generalize well to other types of documents or texts that significantly differ from the language and structure of patents.\n\n2. **Bias and Fairness**: Like any machine learning model, `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` may inherit biases present in the training data. Users should be aware of potential biases in the generated summaries and exercise caution when using them in decision-making processes.\n\n3. **Intellectual Property**: The use of the model, especially in commercial applications, should respect the intellectual property rights associated with the model and the underlying dataset. Users should ensure they have the necessary rights or permissions to use the model in their intended manner.\n\n4. **Performance Expectations**: While the model is state-of-the-art, it is not infallible. The quality of the output can vary, and there may be inaccuracies or nonsensical results. Users should review and possibly edit the model's output before relying on it.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: The use of AI for summarizing patent documents should be done with ethical considerations in mind, including the potential impact on jobs and the legal implications of using AI-generated summaries.\n\n6. **No Warranty**: Typically, models like `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` are provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind. Users should not rely on the model for critical tasks without thorough verification.\n\n7. **Updates and Support**: The model may be updated over time, and earlier versions may become obsolete. Users should stay informed about updates and changes that might affect the model's performance or compatibility.\n\n8. **Regulatory Compliance**: Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of the model complies with all relevant laws and regulations, including those related to data privacy and protection.\n\nIt is crucial for users to understand these disclaimers to set appropriate expectations and to use the model responsibly and ethically."]}

{"question": "description", "chain": "retrieval", "prompt": ["The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which itself is an extension of the Pegasus architecture, tailored specifically for handling long documents and tasks that require understanding of extensive context. This model is pre-trained on the BigPatent dataset, which comprises patent documents, making it particularly suited for summarization tasks in the legal and patent domain.\n\nThe BigBird architecture introduces a sparse attention mechanism that allows it to handle sequences significantly longer than what is possible with the standard Transformer models like BERT or Pegasus. While traditional Transformer models use full self-attention where each token attends to every other token, leading to quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length, BigBird utilizes a combination of random, window, and global attention mechanisms to reduce this complexity to linear.\n\nIn the BigBird model, the random attention ensures that each token attends to a random set of other tokens, providing a way to capture long-range dependencies. The window attention allows for attending to neighboring tokens, which is similar to local attention patterns. The global attention is applied to important tokens such as [CLS], [SEP], or other task-specific tokens that are crucial for understanding the overall context or structure of the document.\n\nThe `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model inherits these characteristics and is fine-tuned on the BigPatent dataset, which consists of diverse patent documents. The Pegasus part of the model's name indicates that it is designed for abstractive summarization, where the model generates coherent and concise summaries that may include novel sentences not found in the source text. The Pegasus model is pre-trained with a self-supervised objective called gap-sentence generation, where certain sentences are masked in the input document, and the model learns to predict these sentences, which helps it to learn summarization implicitly.\n\nIn summary, `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a large-scale Transformer model optimized for long document processing, with a sparse attention mechanism that allows it to efficiently handle the extensive context found in patent documents, and it is fine-tuned for the task of abstractive summarization on the BigPatent dataset.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an adaptation of the PEGASUS model, fine-tuned specifically for the task of summarization on the BIGPATENT dataset. The BIGPATENT dataset comprises a large collection of patent documents, making it an ideal training ground for a model intended to generate summaries of long and complex documents.\n\nHere are some basic details about the training procedures for such a model:\n\n1. **Pre-training**: The BigBird model, like PEGASUS, is pre-trained on a large corpus of text. This pre-training involves self-supervised learning, where the model is trained to predict masked tokens in the input, helping it to understand the context and semantics of the language.\n\n2. **Architecture**: BigBird extends the Transformer architecture by incorporating sparse attention mechanisms. This allows the model to handle longer sequences of text efficiently, which is crucial for summarizing lengthy patent documents.\n\n3. **Fine-tuning**: After pre-training, the model is fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset. During fine-tuning, the model's parameters are adjusted to better perform the specific task of summarization. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, and the model is trained to generate accurate and coherent summaries of the patent documents.\n\n4. **Objective**: The fine-tuning process typically uses a sequence-to-sequence learning objective, where the input is a long document and the output is a shorter summary. The model is trained to minimize the difference between its generated summaries and the human-written abstracts provided in the BIGPATENT dataset.\n\n5. **Optimization**: The training process involves using an optimizer such as Adam or Adafactor, with a learning rate schedule that may include warm-up steps and learning rate decay to improve convergence.\n\n6. **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout are used to prevent overfitting, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n\n7. **Evaluation**: Throughout the training process, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set to monitor its ability to generate summaries. Metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) are used to assess the quality of the summaries.\n\n8. **Computational Resources**: Training such a large model requires significant computational resources, often involving the use of multiple GPUs or TPUs to handle the large number of parameters and the long sequences of text.\n\n9. **Post-training Adjustments**: After the initial fine-tuning, additional adjustments might be made based on the performance on the validation set, such as tweaking hyperparameters or further training with a reduced learning rate.\n\nBy following these training procedures, the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model is tailored to generate concise and informative summaries of patent documents, capturing the essence of complex technical information in a more digestible form.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an adaptation of the PEGASUS model, fine-tuned specifically for the task of summarization on the BIGPATENT dataset. The BIGPATENT dataset comprises patent documents, and the model is optimized to generate abstractive summaries of these documents.\n\nHere are some basic details about the parameters of the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model:\n\n1. **Model Architecture**: BigBird is a sparse-attention-based transformer that extends the standard Transformer model by incorporating sparse attention mechanisms. This allows it to handle longer sequences of data, which is particularly useful for tasks like summarization of lengthy documents such as patents.\n\n2. **Parameter Count**: The \"large\" in the model name suggests that it has a significant number of parameters. While the exact number of parameters for this specific model is not provided, the original BigBird model has around 400 million parameters, and PEGASUS models typically have a similar scale of parameters. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` has several hundred million parameters.\n\n3. **Attention Mechanism**: The model uses a combination of global, window, and random sparse attention patterns to efficiently process long documents while maintaining the ability to capture both local and global dependencies in the text.\n\n4. **Fine-tuning**: The model has been fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset, which means its parameters have been adjusted from the pre-trained state to better perform the summarization task on patent literature.\n\n5. **Input and Output**: The model is designed to take a long sequence of text as input and produce a concise, coherent summary as output. The input sequence length and output length can vary, but BigBird models are capable of handling sequences much longer than the standard Transformer models.\n\n6. **Pre-training**: Before fine-tuning on the BIGPATENT dataset, the model was pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. During pre-training, it learned a general understanding of language, which was then specialized to the domain of patent summarization.\n\n7. **Tokenizer**: The model uses a tokenizer to convert text into tokens that can be processed by the neural network. The tokenizer is an important part of the model's parameters as it defines the vocabulary and how text is broken down into manageable pieces.\n\nTo use this model effectively, one would typically access it through the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides APIs for easy interaction with pre-trained models like `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent`. Users can leverage the model for generating summaries of patent documents without needing to train the model from scratch, taking advantage of its specialized capabilities for this domain.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the PEGASUS model, fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset. This model is designed for tasks such as summarization, particularly focusing on long documents like patents. However, when using this model, it is important to consider several disclaimers:\n\n1. **Training Data Limitations**: The model has been trained on the BIGPATENT dataset, which consists of patent documents. Its performance may not generalize well to other types of documents or texts that significantly differ from the language and structure of patents.\n\n2. **Bias and Fairness**: Like any machine learning model, `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` may inherit biases present in the training data. Users should be aware of potential biases in the generated summaries and exercise caution when using them in decision-making processes.\n\n3. **Intellectual Property**: The use of the model, especially in commercial applications, should respect the intellectual property rights associated with the model and the underlying dataset. Users should ensure they have the necessary rights or permissions to use the model in their intended manner.\n\n4. **Performance Expectations**: While the model is state-of-the-art, it is not infallible. The quality of the output can vary, and there may be inaccuracies or nonsensical results. Users should review and possibly edit the model's output before relying on it.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: The use of AI for summarizing patent documents should be done with ethical considerations in mind, including the potential impact on jobs and the legal implications of using AI-generated summaries.\n\n6. **No Warranty**: Typically, models like `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` are provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind. Users should not rely on the model for critical tasks without thorough verification.\n\n7. **Updates and Support**: The model may be updated over time, and earlier versions may become obsolete. Users should stay informed about updates and changes that might affect the model's performance or compatibility.\n\n8. **Regulatory Compliance**: Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of the model complies with all relevant laws and regulations, including those related to data privacy and protection.\n\nIt is crucial for users to understand these disclaimers to set appropriate expectations and to use the model responsibly and ethically."], "answer": ["In this section, we describe the BIGBIRD model using the generalised attention mechanism that is used in each layer of transformer operating on an input sequence X = (x 1 , ...,\nx n ) \u2208 R n\u00d7d .", "The second viewpoint which inspired the creation of BIGBIRD is that most contexts within NLP and computational biology have data which displays a great deal of locality of reference. In this phenomenon, a great deal of information about a token can be derived from its neighboring tokens. Most pertinently, Clark et al. [19] investigated self-attention models in NLP tasks and concluded that that neighboring inner-products are extremely important. The concept of locality, proximity of tokens in linguistic", "The final attention mechanism for BIGBIRD (Fig. 1d) has all three of these properties: queries attend to r random keys, each query attends to w/2 tokens to the left of its location and w/2 to the right of its location and they contain g global tokens (The global tokens can be from existing tokens or extra added tokens). We provide implementation details in App. D.", "However, deleting such random edges might be inefficient on modern hardware, so we retain it, which will not affect its properties. In summary, to capture these local structures in the context, in BIGBIRD, we define a sliding window attention, so that during self attention of width w, query at location i attends from i \u2212 w/2 to i + w/2 keys. In our notation, A(i, i \u2212 w/2 : i + w/2) = 1 (see Fig. 1b). As an initial sanity check, we performed basic experiments to test whether these intuitions are sufficient", "The final piece of BIGBIRD is inspired from our theoretical analysis (Sec. 3), which is critical for empirical performance. More specifically, our theory utilizes the importance of \"global tokens\" (tokens that attend to all tokens in the sequence and to whom all tokens attend to (see Fig. 1c). These global tokens can be defined in two ways:", "As a result we propose to first blockify the attention pattern i.e. we pack sets of query and keys together and then define attention on these blocks. It is easier to explain this process using the example shown in Fig. 3. Suppose, there are 12 query and 12 key vectors to attend to. Using a block size of 2, we split the query matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks and similarly the key matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks. Then the three different building components of BIGBIRD are defined on the block matrix. In particular", "In this section we provide details of the experimental setup for BIGBIRD on genomics data.", "We optimize the code for modern hardware. Hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs truly shine on coalesced memory operations which load blocks of contiguous bytes at once. Thus, its not very efficient to have small sporadic look-ups caused by a sliding window or random element queries. We alleviate this by \"blockifying\" the lookups.", "2. Window local attention: While creating the block, we ensure that the number of query blocks and the number of key blocks are the same. This helps us in defining the block window attention. Every query block with index j attends to key block with index j \u2212 (w \u2212 1)/2 to j + (w \u2212 1)/2, including key block j. In Fig. 3b, w = 3 with block size 2. It means that each query block j (size 2 queries) attends to key block j \u2212 1, j, j + 1.", "GPU/TPU and Sparsity Ideally, if the adjacency matrix A described in Sec. 2 is sparse, one would hope this would be sufficient to speed up the implementation. Unfortunately, it is well known [33,102], that such sparse multiplications cannot be efficiently implemented in GPUs. GPUs have thousands of cores performing operations in parallel. Thus, we cannot efficiently perform the sparse matrix multiplication mentioned in section Sec. 2.", "\u2022 BIGBIRD-ETC: In extended transformer construction (ETC), we include additional \"global\" tokens such as CLS. Concretely, we add g global tokens that attend to all existing tokens. In our notation, this corresponds to creating a new matrix B \u2208 [0, 1] (N +g)\u00d7(N +g) by adding g rows to matrix A, such that B(i, :) = 1, and B(:, i) = 1 for all i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . g}, and B(g + i, g + j) = A(i, j)\u2200 i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , N }. This adds extra location to store context and as we will see in the experiments improves", "BigBird, is a sparse-attention based transformer which extends Transformer based models, such as BERT to much longer sequences. Moreover, BigBird comes along with a theoretical understanding of the capabilities of a complete transformer that the sparse model can handle.\n\nAs a consequence of the capability to handle longer context,\nBigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization.", "Finally, we show that sparse attention mechanisms can not universally replace dense attention mechanisms, i.e. there is no free lunch. We demonstrate a natural task which can be solved by the full attention mechanism in O(1)-layers. However, under standard complexity theoretic assumptions, we show that this problem will require\u03a9(n)-layers for any sparse attention layers with\u00d5(n) edges (not just BIGBIRD).

This allows it to handle longer sequences of data, which is particularly useful for tasks like summarization of lengthy documents such as patents.\n\n2. **Parameter Count**: The \"large\" in the model name suggests that it has a significant number of parameters. While the exact number of parameters for this specific model is not provided, the original BigBird model has around 400 million parameters, and PEGASUS models typically have a similar scale of parameters. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` has several hundred million parameters.\n\n3. **Attention Mechanism**: The model uses a combination of global, window, and random sparse attention patterns to efficiently process long documents while maintaining the ability to capture both local and global dependencies in the text.\n\n4. **Fine-tuning**: The model has been fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset, which means its parameters have been adjusted from the pre-trained state to better perform the summarization task on patent literature.\n\n5. **Input and Output**: The model is designed to take a long sequence of text as input and produce a concise, coherent summary as output. The input sequence length and output length can vary, but BigBird models are capable of handling sequences much longer than the standard Transformer models.\n\n6. **Pre-training**: Before fine-tuning on the BIGPATENT dataset, the model was pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. During pre-training, it learned a general understanding of language, which was then specialized to the domain of patent summarization.\n\n7. **Tokenizer**: The model uses a tokenizer to convert text into tokens that can be processed by the neural network. The tokenizer is an important part of the model's parameters as it defines the vocabulary and how text is broken down into manageable pieces.\n\nTo use this model effectively, one would typically access it through the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides APIs for easy interaction with pre-trained models like `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent`. Users can leverage the model for generating summaries of patent documents without needing to train the model from scratch, taking advantage of its specialized capabilities for this domain.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the PEGASUS model, fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset. This model is designed for tasks such as summarization, particularly focusing on long documents like patents. However, when using this model, it is important to consider several disclaimers:\n\n1. **Training Data Limitations**: The model has been trained on the BIGPATENT dataset, which consists of patent documents. Its performance may not generalize well to other types of documents or texts that significantly differ from the language and structure of patents.\n\n2. **Bias and Fairness**: Like any machine learning model, `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` may inherit biases present in the training data. Users should be aware of potential biases in the generated summaries and exercise caution when using them in decision-making processes.\n\n3. **Intellectual Property**: The use of the model, especially in commercial applications, should respect the intellectual property rights associated with the model and the underlying dataset. Users should ensure they have the necessary rights or permissions to use the model in their intended manner.\n\n4. **Performance Expectations**: While the model is state-of-the-art, it is not infallible. The quality of the output can vary, and there may be inaccuracies or nonsensical results. Users should review and possibly edit the model's output before relying on it.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: The use of AI for summarizing patent documents should be done with ethical considerations in mind, including the potential impact on jobs and the legal implications of using AI-generated summaries.\n\n6. **No Warranty**: Typically, models like `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` are provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind. Users should not rely on the model for critical tasks without thorough verification.\n\n7. **Updates and Support**: The model may be updated over time, and earlier versions may become obsolete. Users should stay informed about updates and changes that might affect the model's performance or compatibility.\n\n8. **Regulatory Compliance**: Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of the model complies with all relevant laws and regulations, including those related to data privacy and protection.\n\nIt is crucial for users to understand these disclaimers to set appropriate expectations and to use the model responsibly and ethically."], "answer": ["BigBird, is a sparse-attention based transformer which extends Transformer based models, such as BERT to much longer sequences.

We compare performance in predicting the masked out tokens in terms of bits per character, following [8].

In this section, we describe the BIGBIRD model using the generalised attention mechanism that is used in each layer of transformer operating on an input sequence X = (x 1 , ...,\nx n ) \u2208 R n\u00d7d .\n2. The second viewpoint which inspired the creation of BIGBIRD is that most contexts within NLP and computational biology have data which displays a great deal of locality of reference. In this phenomenon, a great deal of information about a token can be derived from its neighboring tokens. Most pertinently, Clark et al. [19] investigated self-attention models in NLP tasks and concluded that that neighboring inner-products are extremely important. The concept of locality, proximity of tokens in linguistic\n3. The final attention mechanism for BIGBIRD (Fig. 1d) has all three of these properties: queries attend to r random keys, each query attends to w/2 tokens to the left of its location and w/2 to the right of its location and they contain g global tokens (The global tokens can be from existing tokens or extra added tokens). We provide implementation details in App. D.\n4. However, deleting such random edges might be inefficient on modern hardware, so we retain it, which will not affect its properties. In summary, to capture these local structures in the context, in BIGBIRD, we define a sliding window attention, so that during self attention of width w, query at location i attends from i \u2212 w/2 to i + w/2 keys. In our notation, A(i, i \u2212 w/2 : i + w/2) = 1 (see Fig. 1b). As an initial sanity check, we performed basic experiments to test whether these intuitions are sufficient\n5. The final piece of BIGBIRD is inspired from our theoretical analysis (Sec. 3), which is critical for empirical performance. More specifically, our theory utilizes the importance of \"global tokens\" (tokens that attend to all tokens in the sequence and to whom all tokens attend to (see Fig. 1c). These global tokens can be defined in two ways:\n6. As a result we propose to first blockify the attention pattern i.e. we pack sets of query and keys together and then define attention on these blocks. It is easier to explain this process using the example shown in Fig. 3. Suppose, there are 12 query and 12 key vectors to attend to. Using a block size of 2, we split the query matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks and similarly the key matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks. Then the three different building components of BIGBIRD are defined on the block matrix. In particular\n7. In this section we provide details of the experimental setup for BIGBIRD on genomics data.\n8. We optimize the code for modern hardware. Hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs truly shine on coalesced memory operations which load blocks of contiguous bytes at once. Thus, its not very efficient to have small sporadic look-ups caused by a sliding window or random element queries. We alleviate this by \"blockifying\" the lookups.\n9.

Fine-tuning this model for a specific task involves several steps:\n\n1. **Dataset Preparation**: Collect a dataset that is relevant to the specific task you want to fine-tune the model for. This dataset should be in a similar format to the data the model was pre-trained on, with inputs and expected outputs. For example, if you are fine-tuning for summarization, your dataset should consist of long documents and their corresponding summaries.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset to match the input format expected by the BigBird-Pegasus model. This may include tokenizing the text using the same tokenizer that was used during pre-training, truncating or padding sequences to the model's maximum sequence length, and converting the data into tensors that can be processed by the model.\n\n3. **Defining the Task**: Clearly define the task and the expected output. For instance, if the task is document summarization, the output would be a concise and informative summary of the input document.\n\n4. **Model Configuration**: Load the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model with its pre-trained weights. Adjust the model's hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs, to suit the fine-tuning process. You may also want to freeze some layers of the model if you wish to only fine-tune certain parts of it.\n\n5. **Fine-Tuning**: Use the prepared dataset to fine-tune the model. This involves training the model on your task-specific dataset, allowing the model to adjust its weights based on the error between its predictions and the actual outcomes. This process is typically done using a smaller learning rate compared to the initial pre-training phase to make more subtle adjustments to the weights.\n\n6. **Evaluation**: After fine-tuning, evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation set that was not used during training. This helps to ensure that the model is generalizing well and not just memorizing the training data.\n\n7. **Iteration**: Based on the evaluation results, you may need to iterate on steps 4 and 5, adjusting hyperparameters and continuing to fine-tune until the model achieves satisfactory performance on the task.\n\n8. **Deployment**: Once the model is fine-tuned and evaluated, it can be deployed for inference on new, unseen data relevant to the task it was fine-tuned for.\n\nThroughout this process, it's important to monitor for issues such as overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.

Fine-tuning this model for a specific task involves several steps:\n\n1. **Dataset Preparation**: Collect a dataset that is relevant to the specific task you want to fine-tune the model for. This dataset should be in a similar format to the data the model was pre-trained on, with inputs and expected outputs. For example, if you are fine-tuning for summarization, your dataset should consist of long documents and their corresponding summaries.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset to match the input format expected by the BigBird-Pegasus model. This may include tokenizing the text using the same tokenizer that was used during pre-training, truncating or padding sequences to the model's maximum sequence length, and converting the data into tensors that can be processed by the model.\n\n3. **Defining the Task**: Clearly define the task and the expected output. For instance, if the task is document summarization, the output would be a concise and informative summary of the input document.\n\n4. **Model Configuration**: Load the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model with its pre-trained weights. Adjust the model's hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs, to suit the fine-tuning process. You may also want to freeze some layers of the model if you wish to only fine-tune certain parts of it.\n\n5. **Fine-Tuning**: Use the prepared dataset to fine-tune the model. This involves training the model on your task-specific dataset, allowing the model to adjust its weights based on the error between its predictions and the actual outcomes. This process is typically done using a smaller learning rate compared to the initial pre-training phase to make more subtle adjustments to the weights.\n\n6. **Evaluation**: After fine-tuning, evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation set that was not used during training. This helps to ensure that the model is generalizing well and not just memorizing the training data.\n\n7. **Iteration**: Based on the evaluation results, you may need to iterate on steps 4 and 5, adjusting hyperparameters and continuing to fine-tune until the model achieves satisfactory performance on the task.\n\n8. **Deployment**: Once the model is fine-tuned and evaluated, it can be deployed for inference on new, unseen data relevant to the task it was fine-tuned for.\n\nThroughout this process, it's important to monitor for issues such as overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.

Here's how it can be integrated into a larger ecosystem or app:\n\n**API Integration:**\nThe model can be accessed through machine learning frameworks like Hugging Face's Transformers library, which provides an API for direct interaction. By integrating this API into an application, developers can leverage the model's capabilities for summarizing patent texts or other related documents.\n\n**Document Management Systems:**\nIncorporating the model into document management systems can automate the summarization of patents, legal documents, or research papers. This can help users quickly grasp the essence of lengthy documents without reading them in their entirety.\n\n**Search Engines:**\nThe model can be used to enhance search engines that specialize in patent databases or scientific literature by providing concise summaries alongside search results, improving the user experience by allowing for quicker evaluation of the relevance of documents.\n\n**Legal and R&D Tools:**\nFor legal professionals and researchers, the model can be integrated into tools that assist with the review of patent applications or the analysis of existing patents, streamlining the workflow and aiding in the decision-making process.\n\n**Educational Platforms:**\nIn educational settings, the model can be used to summarize complex material, making it more accessible to students, especially in fields like intellectual property law or engineering.\n\n**Content Creation:**\nThe model can be used in content creation platforms to generate abstracts or summaries for articles, reports, or blog posts that reference patents, saving time for writers and journalists.\n\n**Language Processing Pipelines:**\nThe model can be a component in a larger natural language processing (NLP) pipeline that includes tasks like document classification, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis, providing a comprehensive toolset for processing and understanding patent literature.\n\nTo integrate the model into an app or ecosystem, developers would typically use a combination of web frameworks, cloud services, and NLP libraries to create a seamless workflow that includes the model's summarization capabilities as part of the overall application logic. This would involve setting up the necessary infrastructure to handle the computational load, ensuring that the model can scale to meet the demands of the user base, and implementing appropriate user interfaces to interact with the model's output.", "Certainly!

For quickly starting with BigBird, one can start by running the classification experiment code in `classifier` directory.\nTo run the code simply execute\n\n```shell\nexport GCP_PROJECT_NAME=bigbird-project  # Replace by your project name\nexport GCP_EXP_BUCKET=gs://bigbird-transformer-training/  # Replace\nsh -x bigbird/classifier/base_size.sh\n```\n2. As a result we propose to first blockify the attention pattern i.e. we pack sets of query and keys together and then define attention on these blocks. It is easier to explain this process using the example shown in Fig. 3. Suppose, there are 12 query and 12 key vectors to attend to. Using a block size of 2, we split the query matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks and similarly the key matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks. Then the three different building components of BIGBIRD are defined on the block matrix. In particular\n3. We optimize the code for modern hardware. Hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs truly shine on coalesced memory operations which load blocks of contiguous bytes at once. Thus, its not very efficient to have small sporadic look-ups caused by a sliding window or random element queries. We alleviate this by \"blockifying\" the lookups.\n4. 2. Window local attention: While creating the block, we ensure that the number of query blocks and the number of key blocks are the same. This helps us in defining the block window attention. Every query block with index j attends to key block with index j \u2212 (w \u2212 1)/2 to j + (w \u2212 1)/2, including key block j. In Fig. 3b, w = 3 with block size 2. It means that each query block j (size 2 queries) attends to key block j \u2212 1, j, j + 1.\n5. GPU/TPU and Sparsity Ideally, if the adjacency matrix A described in Sec. 2 is sparse, one would hope this would be sufficient to speed up the implementation. Unfortunately, it is well known [33,102], that such sparse multiplications cannot be efficiently implemented in GPUs. GPUs have thousands of cores performing operations in parallel. Thus, we cannot efficiently perform the sparse matrix multiplication mentioned in section Sec. 2.\n6.

It incorporates the BigBird attention mechanism, which allows for efficient processing of longer sequences than standard transformer models, making it particularly suitable for tasks involving lengthy texts such as patents.\n\nWhen fine-tuned for a specific task, this model can be adapted to perform a variety of NLP tasks such as text classification, summarization, and question answering. For example, in a legal tech application, the model could be fine-tuned to summarize patent documents or to classify them according to their relevance to a particular field of technology.\n\nTo plug this model into a larger ecosystem or app, you would typically use a machine learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch to load the pre-trained model, fine-tune it on your task-specific dataset, and then integrate it into your application. The model can be used directly for inference or further trained with additional data to improve its performance on the specific task.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might fine-tune the model for a binary classification task, such as classifying patent documents as relevant or not relevant to a particular query. Note that this is a conceptual example and assumes that you have a dataset for fine-tuning and the necessary environment set up:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BigBirdPegasusForConditionalGeneration, Trainer, TrainingArguments\n\n# Load the pre-trained BigBird-Pegasus model\nmodel = BigBirdPegasusForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent')\n\n# Prepare your dataset for fine-tuning (not shown here)\ntrain_dataset = ...\neval_dataset = ...\n\n# Define training arguments\ntraining_args = TrainingArguments(\n    output_dir='./results',          # output directory for model checkpoints\n    num_train_epochs=3,              # number of training epochs\n    per_device_train_batch_size=4,   # batch size for training\n    per_device_eval_batch_size=4,    # batch size for evaluation\n    warmup_steps=500,                # number of warmup steps for learning rate scheduler\n    evaluation_strategy='epoch',     # evaluate each `logging_steps`\n)\n\n# Initialize the Trainer\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=train_dataset,\n    eval_dataset=eval_dataset\n)\n\n# Fine-tune the model\ntrainer.train()\n\n# Save the fine-tuned model\ntrainer.save_model('./fine-tuned-bigbird')\n```\n\nAfter fine-tuning, the model can be deployed in an application where it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen patent documents. The application would preprocess the input text to conform to the model's expected format, pass it to the model for inference, and then post-process the model's output to present it to the end-user in a useful way.\n\nPlease note that the above code snippet is a generic example of how to fine-tune a transformer model using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.

Here are some potential issues:\n\n1. **Bias and Fairness**: Like many large language models, BigBird-Pegasus could inherit and amplify biases present in the training data. The BIGPATENT dataset consists of patent documents, which may contain technical jargon and legal language that is not representative of more general language use. This can lead to biased outputs when the model is applied to general text.\n\n2. **Out-of-Domain Performance**: The model is fine-tuned for summarization tasks on patent literature, which means it might not perform as well on out-of-domain texts. When presented with text from other domains, the quality of the summarization may degrade.\n\n3. **Lengthy Outputs**: BigBird is designed to handle longer sequences of text, which can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. In some cases, the model might generate overly verbose summaries that could have been more concise.\n\n4. **Computational Requirements**: The model is large and requires significant computational resources to run, which can be a barrier for those without access to powerful hardware or cloud computing services.\n\n5. **Interpretability**: As with many deep learning models, the decision-making process of BigBird-Pegasus is not easily interpretable. This can make it difficult to understand why the model generates certain outputs or to identify the source of errors.\n\n6. **Generalization**: While the model is trained on a large dataset of patents, it may not generalize well to patents that are significantly different from those in the training set or to patents from jurisdictions not well represented in the dataset.\n\n7. **Update and Maintenance**: Models like BigBird-Pegasus require ongoing maintenance and updates to remain effective. Changes in patent language, legal standards, or the introduction of new technologies could reduce the model's relevance over time if not regularly updated.\n\n8. **Error Propagation**: In sequence-to-sequence tasks, errors can propagate as the model generates text. This means that an error early in the summarization could lead to further inaccuracies later in the text.\n\nIt's important to note that the developers and users of the model may have identified and addressed some of these issues since my last update, and new issues may have emerged. Users should consult the latest documentation and user feedback for the most current information on the model's performance and limitations.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the Pegasus model, fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset for summarization tasks. While this model offers significant benefits in processing long documents and generating coherent summaries, there are several foreseeable harms that should be considered:\n\n1. **Bias and Fairness**: The model may inherit and amplify biases present in the training data. Since it is trained on patent documents, the language and examples used may not be representative of diverse demographics or viewpoints. This can lead to biased summaries that favor certain groups or perspectives over others.\n\n2. **Misinformation**: If the model is used to summarize complex patent texts without proper oversight, it may inadvertently generate incorrect or misleading information. Users may take these summaries at face value, leading to the spread of misinformation.\n\n3. **Intellectual Property Issues**: The model could be used to generate summaries of patents that are then misappropriated or used without proper attribution, leading to potential intellectual property conflicts.\n\n4. **Dependence on Automation**: Over-reliance on automated summarization for understanding patents could reduce the demand for human expertise in this field, potentially leading to a loss of nuanced understanding and critical analysis skills.\n\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: If the model is applied to confidential or sensitive patent documents, there is a risk of privacy breaches, especially if the summaries are not properly secured or if the model inadvertently reveals proprietary information.\n\n6. **Economic Impact**: The model could disrupt traditional patent analysis and legal industries, potentially leading to job displacement for professionals in these sectors.\n\n7. **Security Risks**: As with any AI model, there is a risk of adversarial attacks where malicious actors could manipulate the model to produce desired outputs, which could have serious implications in the context of patent law and innovation.\n\n8. **Environmental Impact**: The training and operation of large language models like BigBird-Pegasus are resource-intensive and contribute to carbon emissions. The environmental impact of deploying such models at scale should be considered.\n\nMitigating these harms requires careful consideration of the model's deployment context, ongoing monitoring for bias and errors, and the establishment of ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible use.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the Pegasus model, fine-tuned specifically for the task of patent summarization.

However, it is specifically optimized for summarizing patent documents. While it can be used for other types of documents, its performance may not be as strong as it is with patent literature.\n\n2. **Model Size and Complexity**: There might be a misconception that bigger models always yield better results. Although `bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a large model with a significant number of parameters, it may not always outperform smaller, more specialized models for certain tasks or datasets.\n\n3. **Training Data**: Another misunderstanding could be about the training data. The model is fine-tuned on patent-related data, which means it has learned patterns and language typical of patents. It may not generalize as well to other domains without further fine-tuning.\n\n4. **Computational Requirements**: Users might underestimate the computational resources required to run such a large model. It requires substantial memory and processing power, which might not be feasible for all users or applications.\n\n5. **Interpretability**: There might be an expectation that the model's outputs are always interpretable and explainable. However, like many deep learning models, the decision-making process of `bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` can be opaque, making it difficult to understand how it arrived at a particular summary.\n\n6. **Quality of Summaries**: Users may expect that the summaries generated by the model are perfect and do not require any further editing. In reality, while the model can produce high-quality summaries, they may still require human review and editing to ensure accuracy and coherence.\n\n7. **Language Support**: It might be assumed that the model supports multiple languages.

Users without access to high-end GPUs or TPUs may find it challenging to utilize the model effectively.\n\n2. **Memory Constraints**: Due to its size and the nature of its transformer architecture, the model demands substantial memory, which can be a limiting factor for users with limited hardware capabilities.\n\n3. **Inference Time**: The model's complexity can lead to longer inference times compared to smaller models, which might be a bottleneck for applications requiring real-time processing.\n\n4. **Fine-tuning Difficulty**: While the model is pre-trained on patent data, adapting it to specific domains or tasks outside of its initial scope may require additional fine-tuning, which can be a complex and resource-intensive process.\n\n5. **Generalization**: Although the model is designed for summarizing patent texts, its performance on other types of documents or in other languages may not be optimal without further training or adaptation.\n\n6. **Data Biases**: The training data used for the model, derived from patent literature, may contain biases that could be reflected in the model's outputs. This can affect the fairness and reliability of the summaries generated.\n\n7. **Model Interpretability**: As with many deep learning models, the BigBird-Pegasus model's decision-making process is not easily interpretable, which can be a limitation for applications where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial.\n\n8. **Maintenance and Updates**: Keeping the model up-to-date with the latest research findings and data can be challenging, as it requires ongoing maintenance and potential retraining.\n\n9. **Licensing and Usage Restrictions**: Depending on the intended use, there may be licensing restrictions or costs associated with using the model, particularly in a commercial setting.\n\n10. **Adaptation to New Data**: The model may not perform well when presented with data that significantly deviates from the characteristics of the training set, such as patents from new technological fields or with different formatting.\n\nThese limitations highlight the importance of considering the specific requirements and constraints of the intended application when choosing to implement the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the PEGASUS model, fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset for summarization tasks.

The BIGPATENT dataset, while extensive, may contain historical biases or imbalances that could lead to biased summaries, potentially disadvantaging certain groups or misrepresenting information.\n\n2. **Interpretability and Transparency**: The model's complexity makes it difficult for users to understand how it generates summaries. This lack of interpretability can be a significant issue when the summaries are used for decision-making in critical domains, as users may not be able to fully trust or validate the model's outputs.\n\n3. **Data Privacy**: The model processes potentially sensitive information contained in patents. Ensuring that the model does not inadvertently leak or memorize private data is crucial, especially when dealing with proprietary or personal information.\n\n4. **Resource Intensity**: BigBird-Pegasus is a large model, which means it requires substantial computational resources for training and inference. This can limit its accessibility to researchers and organizations with less computational power and contribute to environmental concerns due to the energy consumption required for operating such models.\n\n5. **Generalization and Domain Specificity**: While the model is fine-tuned for patent summarization, its performance on documents from other domains may not be optimal. Users may need to further fine-tune the model on domain-specific datasets, which requires additional data and resources.\n\n6. **Dependence on Quality of Input Data**: The quality of the model's summaries is highly dependent on the quality of the input data. If the input patents are poorly structured or contain errors, the summaries generated may also be of low quality.\n\n7. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**: The use of AI for summarizing patents may raise legal and ethical questions, such as the potential for copyright infringement or the impact on patent clerks' employment. Ensuring compliance with regulations and ethical standards is a challenge for deploying such models in a real-world setting.\n\n8. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: The model's outputs may not be accessible to all users, especially those with disabilities. Ensuring that the summaries are presented in an inclusive manner that accommodates diverse needs is an important consideration.\n\nAddressing these sociotechnical limitations requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving not only improvements in the model's design and training but also careful consideration of the broader societal and ethical implications of its deployment."]}

{"question": "bias_risks_limitations", "chain": "retrieval", "prompt": ["As of my last update, the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model, which is a variant of the BigBird model adapted for the Pegasus framework and fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset, may have certain known issues that are common to large language models and those specific to its architecture and training data. Here are some potential issues:\n\n1. **Bias and Fairness**: Like many large language models, BigBird-Pegasus could inherit and amplify biases present in the training data. The BIGPATENT dataset consists of patent documents, which may contain technical jargon and legal language that is not representative of more general language use. This can lead to biased outputs when the model is applied to general text.\n\n2. **Out-of-Domain Performance**: The model is fine-tuned for summarization tasks on patent literature, which means it might not perform as well on out-of-domain texts. When presented with text from other domains, the quality of the summarization may degrade.\n\n3. **Lengthy Outputs**: BigBird is designed to handle longer sequences of text, which can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. In some cases, the model might generate overly verbose summaries that could have been more concise.\n\n4. **Computational Requirements**: The model is large and requires significant computational resources to run, which can be a barrier for those without access to powerful hardware or cloud computing services.\n\n5. **Interpretability**: As with many deep learning models, the decision-making process of BigBird-Pegasus is not easily interpretable. This can make it difficult to understand why the model generates certain outputs or to identify the source of errors.\n\n6. **Generalization**: While the model is trained on a large dataset of patents, it may not generalize well to patents that are significantly different from those in the training set or to patents from jurisdictions not well represented in the dataset.\n\n7. **Update and Maintenance**: Models like BigBird-Pegasus require ongoing maintenance and updates to remain effective. Changes in patent language, legal standards, or the introduction of new technologies could reduce the model's relevance over time if not regularly updated.\n\n8. **Error Propagation**: In sequence-to-sequence tasks, errors can propagate as the model generates text. This means that an error early in the summarization could lead to further inaccuracies later in the text.\n\nIt's important to note that the developers and users of the model may have identified and addressed some of these issues since my last update, and new issues may have emerged. Users should consult the latest documentation and user feedback for the most current information on the model's performance and limitations.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the Pegasus model, fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset for summarization tasks. While this model offers significant benefits in processing long documents and generating coherent summaries, there are several foreseeable harms that should be considered:\n\n1. **Bias and Fairness**: The model may inherit and amplify biases present in the training data. Since it is trained on patent documents, the language and examples used may not be representative of diverse demographics or viewpoints. This can lead to biased summaries that favor certain groups or perspectives over others.\n\n2. **Misinformation**: If the model is used to summarize complex patent texts without proper oversight, it may inadvertently generate incorrect or misleading information. Users may take these summaries at face value, leading to the spread of misinformation.\n\n3. **Intellectual Property Issues**: The model could be used to generate summaries of patents that are then misappropriated or used without proper attribution, leading to potential intellectual property conflicts.\n\n4. **Dependence on Automation**: Over-reliance on automated summarization for understanding patents could reduce the demand for human expertise in this field, potentially leading to a loss of nuanced understanding and critical analysis skills.\n\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: If the model is applied to confidential or sensitive patent documents, there is a risk of privacy breaches, especially if the summaries are not properly secured or if the model inadvertently reveals proprietary information.\n\n6. **Economic Impact**: The model could disrupt traditional patent analysis and legal industries, potentially leading to job displacement for professionals in these sectors.\n\n7. **Security Risks**: As with any AI model, there is a risk of adversarial attacks where malicious actors could manipulate the model to produce desired outputs, which could have serious implications in the context of patent law and innovation.\n\n8. **Environmental Impact**: The training and operation of large language models like BigBird-Pegasus are resource-intensive and contribute to carbon emissions. The environmental impact of deploying such models at scale should be considered.\n\nMitigating these harms requires careful consideration of the model's deployment context, ongoing monitoring for bias and errors, and the establishment of ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible use.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the Pegasus model, fine-tuned specifically for the task of patent summarization. Despite its capabilities, there are several common misunderstandings related to this model:\n\n1. **Purpose Limitation**: Some may believe that this model is universally applicable for all types of text summarization. However, it is specifically optimized for summarizing patent documents. While it can be used for other types of documents, its performance may not be as strong as it is with patent literature.\n\n2. **Model Size and Complexity**: There might be a misconception that bigger models always yield better results. Although `bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a large model with a significant number of parameters, it may not always outperform smaller, more specialized models for certain tasks or datasets.\n\n3. **Training Data**: Another misunderstanding could be about the training data. The model is fine-tuned on patent-related data, which means it has learned patterns and language typical of patents. It may not generalize as well to other domains without further fine-tuning.\n\n4. **Computational Requirements**: Users might underestimate the computational resources required to run such a large model. It requires substantial memory and processing power, which might not be feasible for all users or applications.\n\n5. **Interpretability**: There might be an expectation that the model's outputs are always interpretable and explainable. However, like many deep learning models, the decision-making process of `bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` can be opaque, making it difficult to understand how it arrived at a particular summary.\n\n6. **Quality of Summaries**: Users may expect that the summaries generated by the model are perfect and do not require any further editing. In reality, while the model can produce high-quality summaries, they may still require human review and editing to ensure accuracy and coherence.\n\n7. **Language Support**: It might be assumed that the model supports multiple languages. However, unless specified, models like `bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` are typically trained on English-language data and are best suited for English text summarization.\n\nUnderstanding these nuances is crucial for effectively utilizing the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model and setting realistic expectations for its performance and capabilities.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the Pegasus model, fine-tuned specifically for the task of patent summarization. Despite its capabilities, there are several technical limitations to consider:\n\n1. **Computational Resources**: BigBird models are large and require significant computational power for both training and inference. Users without access to high-end GPUs or TPUs may find it challenging to utilize the model effectively.\n\n2. **Memory Constraints**: Due to its size and the nature of its transformer architecture, the model demands substantial memory, which can be a limiting factor for users with limited hardware capabilities.\n\n3. **Inference Time**: The model's complexity can lead to longer inference times compared to smaller models, which might be a bottleneck for applications requiring real-time processing.\n\n4. **Fine-tuning Difficulty**: While the model is pre-trained on patent data, adapting it to specific domains or tasks outside of its initial scope may require additional fine-tuning, which can be a complex and resource-intensive process.\n\n5. **Generalization**: Although the model is designed for summarizing patent texts, its performance on other types of documents or in other languages may not be optimal without further training or adaptation.\n\n6. **Data Biases**: The training data used for the model, derived from patent literature, may contain biases that could be reflected in the model's outputs. This can affect the fairness and reliability of the summaries generated.\n\n7. **Model Interpretability**: As with many deep learning models, the BigBird-Pegasus model's decision-making process is not easily interpretable, which can be a limitation for applications where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial.\n\n8. **Maintenance and Updates**: Keeping the model up-to-date with the latest research findings and data can be challenging, as it requires ongoing maintenance and potential retraining.\n\n9. **Licensing and Usage Restrictions**: Depending on the intended use, there may be licensing restrictions or costs associated with using the model, particularly in a commercial setting.\n\n10. **Adaptation to New Data**: The model may not perform well when presented with data that significantly deviates from the characteristics of the training set, such as patents from new technological fields or with different formatting.\n\nThese limitations highlight the importance of considering the specific requirements and constraints of the intended application when choosing to implement the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the PEGASUS model, fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset for summarization tasks. Despite its advanced capabilities, it has several sociotechnical limitations:\n\n1. **Bias and Fairness**: Like any machine learning model, BigBird-Pegasus can inherit and amplify biases present in the training data. The BIGPATENT dataset, while extensive, may contain historical biases or imbalances that could lead to biased summaries, potentially disadvantaging certain groups or misrepresenting information.\n\n2. **Interpretability and Transparency**: The model's complexity makes it difficult for users to understand how it generates summaries. This lack of interpretability can be a significant issue when the summaries are used for decision-making in critical domains, as users may not be able to fully trust or validate the model's outputs.\n\n3. **Data Privacy**: The model processes potentially sensitive information contained in patents. Ensuring that the model does not inadvertently leak or memorize private data is crucial, especially when dealing with proprietary or personal information.\n\n4. **Resource Intensity**: BigBird-Pegasus is a large model, which means it requires substantial computational resources for training and inference. This can limit its accessibility to researchers and organizations with less computational power and contribute to environmental concerns due to the energy consumption required for operating such models.\n\n5. **Generalization and Domain Specificity**: While the model is fine-tuned for patent summarization, its performance on documents from other domains may not be optimal. Users may need to further fine-tune the model on domain-specific datasets, which requires additional data and resources.\n\n6. **Dependence on Quality of Input Data**: The quality of the model's summaries is highly dependent on the quality of the input data. If the input patents are poorly structured or contain errors, the summaries generated may also be of low quality.\n\n7. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**: The use of AI for summarizing patents may raise legal and ethical questions, such as the potential for copyright infringement or the impact on patent clerks' employment. Ensuring compliance with regulations and ethical standards is a challenge for deploying such models in a real-world setting.\n\n8. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: The model's outputs may not be accessible to all users, especially those with disabilities. Ensuring that the summaries are presented in an inclusive manner that accommodates diverse needs is an important consideration.\n\nAddressing these sociotechnical limitations requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving not only improvements in the model's design and training but also careful consideration of the broader societal and ethical implications of its deployment."], "answer": ["Important points to note:\n* Hidden dimension should be divisible by the number of heads.\n* Currently the code only handles tensors of static shape as it is primarily designed\nfor TPUs which only works with statically shaped tensors.\n* For sequene length less than 1024, using `original_full` is advised as there\nis no benefit in using sparse BigBird attention.", "Finally, we show that sparse attention mechanisms can not universally replace dense attention mechanisms, i.e. there is no free lunch.

Changes in patent language, legal standards, or the introduction of new technologies could reduce the model's relevance over time if not regularly updated.\n\n8. **Error Propagation**: In sequence-to-sequence tasks, errors can propagate as the model generates text. This means that an error early in the summarization could lead to further inaccuracies later in the text.\n\nIt's important to note that the developers and users of the model may have identified and addressed some of these issues since my last update, and new issues may have emerged.

Since it is trained on patent documents, the language and examples used may not be representative of diverse demographics or viewpoints. This can lead to biased summaries that favor certain groups or perspectives over others.\n\n2. **Misinformation**: If the model is used to summarize complex patent texts without proper oversight, it may inadvertently generate incorrect or misleading information. Users may take these summaries at face value, leading to the spread of misinformation.\n\n3. **Intellectual Property Issues**: The model could be used to generate summaries of patents that are then misappropriated or used without proper attribution, leading to potential intellectual property conflicts.\n\n4. **Dependence on Automation**: Over-reliance on automated summarization for understanding patents could reduce the demand for human expertise in this field, potentially leading to a loss of nuanced understanding and critical analysis skills.\n\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: If the model is applied to confidential or sensitive patent documents, there is a risk of privacy breaches, especially if the summaries are not properly secured or if the model inadvertently reveals proprietary information.\n\n6. **Economic Impact**: The model could disrupt traditional patent analysis and legal industries, potentially leading to job displacement for professionals in these sectors.\n\n7. **Security Risks**: As with any AI model, there is a risk of adversarial attacks where malicious actors could manipulate the model to produce desired outputs, which could have serious implications in the context of patent law and innovation.\n\n8. **Environmental Impact**: The training and operation of large language models like BigBird-Pegasus are resource-intensive and contribute to carbon emissions. The environmental impact of deploying such models at scale should be considered.\n\nMitigating these harms requires careful consideration of the model's deployment context, ongoing monitoring for bias and errors, and the establishment of ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible use.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the Pegasus model, fine-tuned specifically for the task of patent summarization. Despite its capabilities, there are several common misunderstandings related to this model:\n\n1. **Purpose Limitation**: Some may believe that this model is universally applicable for all types of text summarization. However, it is specifically optimized for summarizing patent documents. While it can be used for other types of documents, its performance may not be as strong as it is with patent literature.\n\n2. **Model Size and Complexity**: There might be a misconception that bigger models always yield better results. Although `bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a large model with a significant number of parameters, it may not always outperform smaller, more specialized models for certain tasks or datasets.\n\n3. **Training Data**: Another misunderstanding could be about the training data. The model is fine-tuned on patent-related data, which means it has learned patterns and language typical of patents. It may not generalize as well to other domains without further fine-tuning.\n\n4. **Computational Requirements**: Users might underestimate the computational resources required to run such a large model. It requires substantial memory and processing power, which might not be feasible for all users or applications.\n\n5. **Interpretability**: There might be an expectation that the model's outputs are always interpretable and explainable. However, like many deep learning models, the decision-making process of `bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` can be opaque, making it difficult to understand how it arrived at a particular summary.\n\n6. **Quality of Summaries**: Users may expect that the summaries generated by the model are perfect and do not require any further editing. In reality, while the model can produce high-quality summaries, they may still require human review and editing to ensure accuracy and coherence.\n\n7. **Language Support**: It might be assumed that the model supports multiple languages. However, unless specified, models like `bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` are typically trained on English-language data and are best suited for English text summarization.\n\nUnderstanding these nuances is crucial for effectively utilizing the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model and setting realistic expectations for its performance and capabilities.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the Pegasus model, fine-tuned specifically for the task of patent summarization.

Users without access to high-end GPUs or TPUs may find it challenging to utilize the model effectively.\n\n2. **Memory Constraints**: Due to its size and the nature of its transformer architecture, the model demands substantial memory, which can be a limiting factor for users with limited hardware capabilities.\n\n3. **Inference Time**: The model's complexity can lead to longer inference times compared to smaller models, which might be a bottleneck for applications requiring real-time processing.\n\n4. **Fine-tuning Difficulty**: While the model is pre-trained on patent data, adapting it to specific domains or tasks outside of its initial scope may require additional fine-tuning, which can be a complex and resource-intensive process.\n\n5. **Generalization**: Although the model is designed for summarizing patent texts, its performance on other types of documents or in other languages may not be optimal without further training or adaptation.\n\n6. **Data Biases**: The training data used for the model, derived from patent literature, may contain biases that could be reflected in the model's outputs. This can affect the fairness and reliability of the summaries generated.\n\n7. **Model Interpretability**: As with many deep learning models, the BigBird-Pegasus model's decision-making process is not easily interpretable, which can be a limitation for applications where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial.\n\n8. **Maintenance and Updates**: Keeping the model up-to-date with the latest research findings and data can be challenging, as it requires ongoing maintenance and potential retraining.\n\n9. **Licensing and Usage Restrictions**: Depending on the intended use, there may be licensing restrictions or costs associated with using the model, particularly in a commercial setting.\n\n10. **Adaptation to New Data**: The model may not perform well when presented with data that significantly deviates from the characteristics of the training set, such as patents from new technological fields or with different formatting.\n\nThese limitations highlight the importance of considering the specific requirements and constraints of the intended application when choosing to implement the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model, which is an extension of the PEGASUS model, fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset for summarization tasks.

The BIGPATENT dataset, while extensive, may contain historical biases or imbalances that could lead to biased summaries, potentially disadvantaging certain groups or misrepresenting information.\n\n2. **Interpretability and Transparency**: The model's complexity makes it difficult for users to understand how it generates summaries. This lack of interpretability can be a significant issue when the summaries are used for decision-making in critical domains, as users may not be able to fully trust or validate the model's outputs.\n\n3. **Data Privacy**: The model processes potentially sensitive information contained in patents. Ensuring that the model does not inadvertently leak or memorize private data is crucial, especially when dealing with proprietary or personal information.\n\n4. **Resource Intensity**: BigBird-Pegasus is a large model, which means it requires substantial computational resources for training and inference. This can limit its accessibility to researchers and organizations with less computational power and contribute to environmental concerns due to the energy consumption required for operating such models.\n\n5. **Generalization and Domain Specificity**: While the model is fine-tuned for patent summarization, its performance on documents from other domains may not be optimal. Users may need to further fine-tune the model on domain-specific datasets, which requires additional data and resources.\n\n6. **Dependence on Quality of Input Data**: The quality of the model's summaries is highly dependent on the quality of the input data. If the input patents are poorly structured or contain errors, the summaries generated may also be of low quality.\n\n7. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**: The use of AI for summarizing patents may raise legal and ethical questions, such as the potential for copyright infringement or the impact on patent clerks' employment. Ensuring compliance with regulations and ethical standards is a challenge for deploying such models in a real-world setting.\n\n8. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: The model's outputs may not be accessible to all users, especially those with disabilities.

However, there are several known and foreseeable issues that stem from the use of this model:\n\n1. **Technical Limitations**:\n   - The model requires the hidden dimension to be divisible by the number of heads, which may limit flexibility in model design and scaling.\n   - It is optimized for TPUs and static tensor shapes, which may not be as efficient on other hardware or with dynamic input shapes.\n   - For sequences shorter than 1024 tokens, the model does not provide benefits over dense attention mechanisms, which could lead to unnecessary computational overhead.\n\n2. **Sparse Attention Mechanism Limitations**:\n   - Sparse attention mechanisms, such as the one used in BigBird, cannot universally replace dense attention mechanisms. There are tasks where dense attention is more efficient, solving problems in O(1) layers, whereas sparse attention would require \u03a9(n) layers. This indicates that BigBird may not be the best choice for all types of tasks.\n\n3. **Sociotechnical Considerations**:\n   - Misunderstandings could arise regarding the model's capabilities, as users might expect it to perform equally well on all tasks, not understanding the limitations of sparse attention mechanisms.\n   - The model's complexity and the need for specific hardware (TPUs) could limit its accessibility to researchers and practitioners with fewer resources.\n   - There is a potential for misuse in applications where the limitations of sparse attention could lead to incorrect or suboptimal results, especially in critical domains like legal or medical document analysis.\n\n4. **Ethical and Societal Impacts**:\n   - The model's improved performance on certain tasks could lead to increased reliance on automated systems, potentially displacing human workers in fields like patent analysis and summarization.\n   - If the model is used in decision-making processes, its biases and limitations could lead to unfair outcomes, particularly if the training data is not representative of all use cases.\n\n5. **Model Interpretability and Transparency**:\n   - The complexity of the model and its attention mechanisms may make it difficult for users to understand how decisions are made, which is crucial for applications in sensitive areas.\n   - The need for additional regularization and highly engineered systems for different datasets, as mentioned in the references, could obscure the understanding of how the model performs across various contexts.\n\n6. **Generalization and Performance**:\n   - While BigBird shows improvements on datasets with longer documents and fewer training examples, its performance on other types of datasets or tasks may not be as impressive.\n   - The model's performance compared to other models, especially when not using ensembles, may lead to overestimation or underestimation of its capabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, while `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a powerful model for certain NLP tasks, it is important to be aware of its technical and sociotechnical limitations.

While this model is designed to handle long documents and generate coherent summaries, there are several foreseeable issues that users and developers should consider:\n\n1. **Computational Resources**: BigBird models are large and require significant computational resources for both fine-tuning and inference. Users should ensure they have access to appropriate hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, to handle the model's demands efficiently.\n\n2. **Fine-tuning for Specific Domains**: While the model is pre-trained on patent literature, its performance on documents from other domains may not be optimal. Users may need to fine-tune the model on domain-specific datasets to achieve the best results for their particular use case.\n\n3. **Bias and Fairness**: The model may inherit biases present in the training data. It is important to evaluate the model's output for potential biases, especially when used in sensitive applications. Users should be prepared to implement strategies to mitigate any discovered biases.\n\n4. **Interpretability and Explainability**: Large models like BigBird can be challenging to interpret, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at certain outputs.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references, here are the recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent:\n\n1. **Model Architecture and Configuration**: Ensure that the hidden dimension is divisible by the number of heads to maintain compatibility with the model's architecture. This is crucial for the model's attention mechanisms to function correctly.\n\n2. **Static Shape Tensors**: The model is designed to work with statically shaped tensors, which is a limitation for dynamic or variable-length inputs. This is particularly important for deployment scenarios that cannot guarantee input shapes that are static. Users should be aware of this limitation when integrating the model into their systems.\n\n3. **Sequence Length Considerations**: For sequences shorter than 1024 tokens, it is recommended to use the `original_full` attention type instead of `block_sparse`. This is because there is no benefit in using sparse BigBird attention for shorter sequences, and full attention may yield better results.\n\n4. **Sparse vs. Dense Attention**: It is important to note that sparse attention mechanisms, such as those used in BigBird, cannot universally replace dense attention mechanisms. There are tasks where dense attention is more efficient, solving problems in O(1) layers, whereas sparse attention would require \u03a9(n) layers. Users should consider the nature of their tasks and whether full attention mechanisms might be more appropriate.\n\n5. **Regularization and Training**: When training the model, additional regularization may be necessary to achieve optimal performance. Users should refer to the appendix and the architecture description for details on the regularization used during the training of BigBird.\n\n6. **Dataset and Task Suitability**: The benefits of using BigBird are more pronounced with longer documents and fewer training examples. Users should consider the characteristics of their datasets when deciding to use this model. For instance, the model shows significant improvements on the Arxiv and Patents datasets.\n\n7. **Pretraining and Vocabulary**: The model has been pretrained on a diverse set of datasets and uses a sentencepiece vocabulary borrowed from RoBERTa and GPT-2. Users should be aware of the potential biases and limitations inherent in the pretraining data and vocabulary when applying the model to their specific domain.\n\n8. **Ethical Considerations**: As a sociotechnic, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications of deploying this model. Users should be aware of potential biases in the training data, the possibility of misuse of the model in generating misleading information, and the need for transparency in the use of AI-generated content.\n\nIn summary, users of the google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model should consider the technical limitations, dataset suitability, and ethical implications when integrating the model into their applications. It is recommended to thoroughly test the model in the specific context of its intended use and to be prepared to address any issues that may arise."}

It has been pre-trained on a large corpus of patent documents, known as the BIGPATENT dataset, to specialize in generating summaries of patent texts. The tokenization process for this model is a crucial step that transforms raw text data into a format that the model can understand and process.\n\nHere's a detailed look at the tokenization process for the data of the model:\n\n1. **SentencePiece Tokenization**: The BigBird-Pegasus model uses the SentencePiece tokenization library, which is a language-agnostic subword tokenizer and detokenizer. SentencePiece enables the model to handle a large number of vocabularies efficiently and is particularly effective for languages that do not have clear word boundaries, like Japanese or Chinese.\n\n2. **Subword Tokenization**: The SentencePiece tokenizer breaks down words into smaller pieces, or subwords, that can represent both common words as whole tokens and rare words as combinations of subword tokens. This subword tokenization helps in dealing with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and reduces the size of the vocabulary that the model needs to handle.\n\n3. **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)**: Although not explicitly stated for this specific model, SentencePiece often uses a variant of Byte-Pair Encoding or a similar algorithm to create its subword vocabulary. BPE is a compression algorithm that iteratively merges the most frequent pair of bytes or characters in a sequence of tokens, which in the context of tokenization, helps to find the most common subwords.\n\n4. **Pre-tokenization**: Before applying SentencePiece, the text may go through a pre-tokenization step where it is cleaned and normalized. This step can include lowercasing, removing special characters, and splitting text into words or sentences.\n\n5. **Vocabulary Mapping**: Each subword token is then mapped to an integer ID from a predefined vocabulary list. This vocabulary is created during the pre-training phase and contains a fixed number of subword tokens that the model recognizes.\n\n6. **Special Tokens**: The tokenizer also adds special tokens that have specific meanings for the model. For example, it adds start-of-sequence tokens, end-of-sequence tokens, padding tokens, and potentially others that help the model understand the structure and context of the input data.\n\n7. **Truncation and Padding**: The tokenized output is then truncated or padded to match the model's maximum sequence length. If the tokenized text is longer than the maximum sequence length, it is truncated, and if it is shorter, it is padded with a special padding token.\n\n8. **Attention Masks**: Alongside the token IDs, attention masks are generated to inform the model which tokens are part of the input and which are padding. This allows the model to focus on the meaningful parts of the input during processing.\n\nOnce the text data has been tokenized, it can be fed into the BigBird-Pegasus model for training or inference. The tokenization process is essential for the model to perform effectively, as it relies on this structured input to generate accurate and coherent summaries.", "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is a variant of the BigBird model adapted to work with the PEGASUS framework, specifically fine-tuned for the task of summarization on the BIGPATENT dataset. The BIGPATENT dataset consists of patent documents, which are typically long and complex, making them an ideal fit for BigBird's capabilities in handling longer sequences.\n\nThe resizing or rewriting process for the data when preparing it for a model like BigBird-Pegasus involves several steps:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: The text data from the patent documents is tokenized, which means it is split into tokens (words or subwords) that the model can understand. This is done using a tokenizer that is compatible with the BigBird-Pegasus model, which is likely based on a subword tokenization algorithm to efficiently handle a large vocabulary with a manageable model size.\n\n2. **Chunking/Segmentation**: Given the length of patent documents, the text may need to be segmented into smaller chunks that fit within the model's maximum sequence length. BigBird is designed to handle longer sequences (up to 4096 tokens) compared to traditional transformer models, but if the document exceeds this length, it would still require segmentation.\n\n3. **Feature Extraction**: The tokenized text is then converted into numerical features that the model can process. This typically involves mapping tokens to their corresponding embeddings, which may include positional embeddings to retain information about the order of tokens.\n\n4. **Attention Span Adjustment**: BigBird utilizes a sparse attention mechanism that allows it to handle longer documents by focusing on a subset of positions within the sequence for each attention operation. This reduces the computational complexity compared to full attention mechanisms.\n\n5. **Special Tokens**: Special tokens such as [CLS] (classification token), [SEP] (separator token), and [PAD] (padding token) are added to the sequence as required by the model's architecture. The [CLS] token is often used in summarization tasks to represent the entire sequence.\n\n6. **Padding and Masking**: Sequences are padded to a consistent length for batching purposes, and attention masks are created to inform the model which tokens are padding and should not be attended to.\n\n7. **Fine-tuning**: The model is then fine-tuned on the BIGPATENT dataset, which involves adjusting the model's weights based on the input data and the desired output (summaries). This process adapts the pre-trained model to the specific language and structure of patent documents.\n\n8. **Output Processing**: Finally, the model generates summaries that are then post-processed to ensure they are coherent and fluent. This may involve merging segments if the original document was divided into chunks, as well as other cleanup steps such as correcting grammar or formatting.\n\nThroughout this process, the goal is to adapt the data to the model's requirements while preserving the meaning and important information from the original patent documents, enabling the model to generate accurate and informative summaries."]}

Window local attention: While creating the block, we ensure that the number of query blocks and the number of key blocks are the same. This helps us in defining the block window attention. Every query block with index j attends to key block with index j \u2212 (w \u2212 1)/2 to j + (w \u2212 1)/2, including key block j. In Fig. 3b, w = 3 with block size 2. It means that each query block j (size 2 queries) attends to key block j \u2212 1, j, j + 1.\n8. We optimize the code for modern hardware. Hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs truly shine on coalesced memory operations which load blocks of contiguous bytes at once. Thus, its not very efficient to have small sporadic look-ups caused by a sliding window or random element queries. We alleviate this by \"blockifying\" the lookups.\n9. We prefix and append each example with [CLS] and [SEP] token respectively. The output corresponding to the [CLS] token from BIGBIRD transformer encoder is fed to a simple binary classification layer. We fine-tune the pretrained BIGBIRD from App. F.1 using hyper-parameters described in Tab. 21. We note that high performance is not surprising due to the overlap in the nature of negative example generation and MLM pretraining.\n10. We use four publicly available datasets Books [110], CC-News [34], Stories [89] and Wikipedia to pretrain BIGBIRD. We borrow the sentencepiece vocabulary as RoBERTa (which is in turn borrowed from GPT2). We split any document longer than 4096 into multiple documents and we join documents that were much smaller than 4096. Following the original BERT training, we mask 15% of tokens in these four datasets, and train to predict the mask. We warm start from RoBERTa's checkpoint. We train two different models:\n11. Pretraining and MLM We follow [22,63] to create base and large versions of BIGBIRD and pretrain it using MLM objective. This task involves predicting a random subset of tokens which have been masked out. We use four standard data-sets for pretraining (listed in App. E.1, Tab. 9), warm-starting from the public RoBERTa checkpoint 2 . We compare performance in predicting the masked out tokens in terms of bits per character, following [8]. As seen in App. E.1, Tab. 10, both BIGBIRD and Longformer perform\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide detail tokenization, resizing/rewriting (depending on the modality), etc. about the preprocessing for the data of the model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent. If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "For the preprocessing of the data used in the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model, we follow a tokenization process that is compatible with the model's architecture. Specifically, we utilize the sentencepiece tokenizer, which is borrowed from RoBERTa and originally from GPT-2, as mentioned in reference 10. This tokenizer is capable of handling various scripts and can tokenize raw text inputs into subword units, which are suitable for the model's training and inference processes.\n\nRegarding the resizing or rewriting of the data, we ensure that documents longer than 4096 tokens are split into multiple documents to fit within the model's maximum sequence length constraints. Conversely, documents that are significantly shorter than 4096 tokens are concatenated with others to approach this threshold, optimizing the use of the model's capacity for handling long documents. This approach is also detailed in reference 10.\n\nDuring pretraining, as part of the Masked Language Model (MLM) objective, we mask 15% of the tokens in the input data and train the model to predict these masked tokens, as described in reference 11. This pretraining step is crucial for the model to learn contextual representations of the data.\n\nFor fine-tuning on specific tasks such as long document summarization, we use checkpoints that have been converted and fine-tuned for the particular dataset in question, as indicated in reference 1. The fine-tuned `tf.SavedModel` can be directly used for prediction and evaluation, which is exemplified in the Colab notebook linked in reference 3.\n\nIn summary, the preprocessing for the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model involves tokenization using a sentencepiece tokenizer, resizing documents to fit within the model's sequence length constraints, and applying the MLM objective during pretraining. For fine-tuning, we utilize dataset-specific checkpoints to ensure the model performs optimally on tasks like long document summarization."}

As seen in App. E.1, Tab. 10, both BIGBIRD and Longformer perform\n2. better than limited length RoBERTa, with BIGBIRD-ETC performing the best. We note that we trained our models on a reasonable 16GB memory/chip with batch size of 32-64. Our memory efficiency is due to efficient blocking and sparsity structure of the sparse attention mechanism described in Sec. 2.\n3. Recently, [Long Range Arena](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04006.pdf) provided a benchmark of six tasks that require longer context, and performed experiments to benchmark all existing long range transformers. The results are shown below.

Below we summarize the results for BIGBIRD using sequence length 4096 1 , while we defer all other setup details including computational resources, batch size, step size, to App. E.\n5. As a result we propose to first blockify the attention pattern i.e. we pack sets of query and keys together and then define attention on these blocks. It is easier to explain this process using the example shown in Fig. 3. Suppose, there are 12 query and 12 key vectors to attend to. Using a block size of 2, we split the query matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks and similarly the key matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks. Then the three different building components of BIGBIRD are defined on the block matrix. In particular\n6. properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having O(1) global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BIGBIRD drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question\n7. Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BIGBIRD, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BIGBIRD is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these\n8.

We note that we trained our models on a reasonable 16GB memory/chip with batch size of 32-64. Our memory efficiency is due to efficient blocking and sparsity structure of the sparse attention mechanism described in Sec. 2.\n4. In this section our goal is to showcase benefits of modeling longer input sequence for NLP tasks, for which we select three representative tasks. We begin with basic masked language modeling (MLM; Devlin et al. 22) to check if better contextual representations can be learnt by utilizing longer contiguous sequences. Next, we consider QA with supporting evidence, for which capability to handle longer sequence would allow us to retrieve more evidence using crude systems like TF-IDF/BM25.   Finally, we tackle\n5. In this section we provide details of the experimental setup for BIGBIRD on genomics data.\n6. In Tab. 3, we compare BIGBIRD-ETC model to top-3 entries from the leaderboard excluding BIGBIRD.\nOne can clearly see the importance of using longer context as both Longformer and BIGBIRD outperform models with smaller contexts. Also, it is worth noting that BIGBIRD submission is a single model, whereas the other top-3 entries for Natural Questions are ensembles, which might explain the slightly lower accuracy in exact answer phrase selection.\n7. Summarization Document summarization is a task of creating a short and accurate summary of a text document. We used three long document datasets for testing our model details of which are mention in Tab. 18. In this paper we focus on abstractive summarization of long documents where using a longer contextual encoder should improve performance. The reasons are two fold: First, the salient content can be evenly distributed in the long document, not just in first 512 tokens, and this is by design in the\n8. - pretrained Pegasus Encoder-Decoder Transformer in large size(`bigbp_large`). Again following original implementation of Pegasus, they are transformers with pre-normalization. They have full set of separate encoder-decoder weights. Also for long document summarization datasets, we have converted Pegasus checkpoints (`model.ckpt-0`) for each dataset and also provided fine-tuned checkpoints (`model.ckpt-300000`) which works on longer documents.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide benchmarks or datasets that the model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent evaluates on.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.

Here are some common metrics:\n\n1. **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**: This set of metrics measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs between the generated summaries and reference summaries. ROUGE-N (e.g., ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2) focuses on n-gram overlap, ROUGE-L on the longest common subsequence, and ROUGE-S on skip-bigram co-occurrence statistics. These metrics help to evaluate the content overlap, but they may not fully capture the semantic accuracy or coherence of the generated text.\n\n2. **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: Originally designed for machine translation, BLEU can also be used for summarization. It measures the precision of n-grams in the generated text against the reference texts. However, BLEU is more limited in assessing the fluency and meaning preservation in summarization tasks.\n\n3. **BERTScore**: This metric leverages the contextual embeddings from models like BERT to compare the semantic similarity between the generated summaries and the reference summaries. BERTScore can capture semantic equivalence better than n-gram-based metrics but may not fully account for factual accuracy or coherence.\n\n4. **METEOR**: The Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering is another metric that evaluates the alignment between the generated and reference texts, considering synonyms and stemming. It is designed to address some of the shortcomings of BLEU and is more correlated with human judgment.\n\n5. **Factuality and Factual Consistency**: These are qualitative metrics that assess whether the information in the generated summaries is factually consistent with the source documents. Automated tools for evaluating factuality are an active area of research, and human evaluation is often used as the gold standard.\n\n6. **Coherence and Readability**: These subjective metrics evaluate how well the generated text flows and how easy it is to read and understand. They can be assessed through human evaluation or using automated readability tests, although the latter may not fully capture coherence.\n\n7. **Novelty and Redundancy**: Novelty measures whether the summary provides new information not explicitly stated in the source text, while redundancy checks for unnecessary repetition. These are important for patent summarization, where the uniqueness of information is crucial.\n\n8. **Error Analysis**: A qualitative assessment of the types of errors made by the model, such as hallucinations (generating information not present in the source text), omissions (leaving out important information), or grammatical errors, can provide insights into the model's weaknesses.\n\nWhen choosing metrics for evaluation, it's important to consider the specific requirements of the task and the tradeoffs between different types of errors. For instance, in patent summarization, factual accuracy might be prioritized over linguistic fluency, and thus metrics that assess factuality and factual consistency might be weighted more heavily. Additionally, human evaluation often plays a crucial role in assessing the overall quality of summaries, especially in professional domains like patent literature where the stakes for accuracy and clarity are high."]}

{"question": "testing_metrics", "chain": "retrieval", "prompt": ["When evaluating the performance of the model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent`, which is designed for tasks like document summarization, particularly in the domain of patents, several metrics can be used to assess its effectiveness while considering the tradeoffs between different types of errors. Here are some common metrics:\n\n1. **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**: This set of metrics measures the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs between the generated summaries and reference summaries. ROUGE-N (e.g., ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2) focuses on n-gram overlap, ROUGE-L on the longest common subsequence, and ROUGE-S on skip-bigram co-occurrence statistics. These metrics help to evaluate the content overlap, but they may not fully capture the semantic accuracy or coherence of the generated text.\n\n2. **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: Originally designed for machine translation, BLEU can also be used for summarization. It measures the precision of n-grams in the generated text against the reference texts. However, BLEU is more limited in assessing the fluency and meaning preservation in summarization tasks.\n\n3. **BERTScore**: This metric leverages the contextual embeddings from models like BERT to compare the semantic similarity between the generated summaries and the reference summaries. BERTScore can capture semantic equivalence better than n-gram-based metrics but may not fully account for factual accuracy or coherence.\n\n4. **METEOR**: The Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering is another metric that evaluates the alignment between the generated and reference texts, considering synonyms and stemming. It is designed to address some of the shortcomings of BLEU and is more correlated with human judgment.\n\n5. **Factuality and Factual Consistency**: These are qualitative metrics that assess whether the information in the generated summaries is factually consistent with the source documents. Automated tools for evaluating factuality are an active area of research, and human evaluation is often used as the gold standard.\n\n6. **Coherence and Readability**: These subjective metrics evaluate how well the generated text flows and how easy it is to read and understand. They can be assessed through human evaluation or using automated readability tests, although the latter may not fully capture coherence.\n\n7. **Novelty and Redundancy**: Novelty measures whether the summary provides new information not explicitly stated in the source text, while redundancy checks for unnecessary repetition. These are important for patent summarization, where the uniqueness of information is crucial.\n\n8. **Error Analysis**: A qualitative assessment of the types of errors made by the model, such as hallucinations (generating information not present in the source text), omissions (leaving out important information), or grammatical errors, can provide insights into the model's weaknesses.\n\nWhen choosing metrics for evaluation, it's important to consider the specific requirements of the task and the tradeoffs between different types of errors. For instance, in patent summarization, factual accuracy might be prioritized over linguistic fluency, and thus metrics that assess factuality and factual consistency might be weighted more heavily.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references, the evaluation metrics for the model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` are not explicitly mentioned in the context of the BigPatent dataset. However, we can infer from the general tasks and results discussed that the following metrics might be relevant:\n\n1. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM) Performance**: As mentioned in reference 4, the performance in predicting masked out tokens is compared in terms of bits per character. This metric is used during pretraining to evaluate the model's ability to understand and predict the context of masked tokens.\n\n2. **Question Answering (QA) Accuracy**: For QA tasks, as described in references 3 and 7, the model's ability to find short answers (SA) and long answers (LA) from given evidence is crucial. Metrics such as Exact Match (EM) and F1 score, which measure the overlap between the predicted answers and the ground truth, are typically used for evaluating QA models.\n\n3. **Summarization Quality**: In reference 6, the task of document summarization is mentioned. For abstractive summarization, metrics like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), which compares the overlap of n-grams between the generated summary and a reference summary, are commonly used to assess the quality of the model's output.\n\n4. **Comparison with Leaderboard Entries**: As indicated in reference 8, the model's performance is compared to top entries on leaderboards, suggesting that the same metrics used in those leaderboards would be relevant for evaluation. This often includes metrics like EM, F1, and ROUGE for tasks like QA and summarization, respectively.\n\nGiven that the BigPatent dataset is related to document summarization, it is likely that ROUGE scores would be a primary metric for evaluating the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model's performance on this task.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "In the experimental section dedicated to explainability and interpretability of the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model, we would highlight the following points:\n\n1. Attention Mechanism: The model utilizes a `block_sparse` attention mechanism, as specified by the `attention_type` configuration parameter. This BigBird attention module is a sparse variant of the traditional full attention mechanism, which allows the model to handle much longer sequences efficiently.\n\n2. Sparse vs. Dense Attention: Our theoretical analysis indicates that while sparse attention mechanisms, like the one used in BigBird, can handle longer sequences and improve performance on various NLP tasks, they cannot universally replace dense attention mechanisms. For certain problems, a full attention mechanism can solve the task in O(1) layers, whereas a sparse attention mechanism would require \u03a9(n) layers, where n is the sequence length.\n\n3. Task-Specific Capabilities: The model's full attention mechanism can solve specific tasks, such as finding the furthest vector in a sequence, in a single layer. This is achieved through a specific construction of query, key, and value functions that leverage the full attention's capability to consider all pairwise interactions between elements in the sequence.\n\n4. Model Limitations: It is important to note that the current implementation of the model is optimized for TPUs, which require statically shaped tensors. Therefore, the model only handles tensors of static shape, and the hidden dimension must be divisible by the number of attention heads.\n\n5. Context Handling: The BigBird model's extended context handling, which allows for sequences up to 8 times longer than previous similar models, results in significant performance improvements on NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization.\n\n6. Empirical Results: The model has achieved state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks, demonstrating the practical benefits of the sparse attention mechanism and the extended context it can model.\n\nIn summary, the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model's explainability can be attributed to its innovative sparse attention mechanism, theoretical underpinnings, and empirical performance. However, it also has limitations due to its design for TPUs and the inherent trade-offs between sparse and dense attention mechanisms."}

Using a block size of 2, we split the query matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks and similarly the key matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks. Then the three different building components of BIGBIRD are defined on the block matrix. In particular\n5. In this section our goal is to showcase benefits of modeling longer input sequence for NLP tasks, for which we select three representative tasks. We begin with basic masked language modeling (MLM; Devlin et al. 22) to check if better contextual representations can be learnt by utilizing longer contiguous sequences. Next, we consider QA with supporting evidence, for which capability to handle longer sequence would allow us to retrieve more evidence using crude systems like TF-IDF/BM25.   Finally, we tackle\n6. We use four publicly available datasets Books [110], CC-News [34], Stories [89] and Wikipedia to pretrain BIGBIRD. We borrow the sentencepiece vocabulary as RoBERTa (which is in turn borrowed from GPT2). We split any document longer than 4096 into multiple documents and we join documents that were much smaller than 4096. Following the original BERT training, we mask 15% of tokens in these four datasets, and train to predict the mask. We warm start from RoBERTa's checkpoint. We train two different models:\n7. - pretrained Pegasus Encoder-Decoder Transformer in large size(`bigbp_large`). Again following original implementation of Pegasus, they are transformers with pre-normalization. They have full set of separate encoder-decoder weights. Also for long document summarization datasets, we have converted Pegasus checkpoints (`model.ckpt-0`) for each dataset and also provided fine-tuned checkpoints (`model.ckpt-300000`) which works on longer documents.\n8. As has been pointed out recently [76,107], pretraining helps in generative tasks, we warm start from our general purpose MLM pretraining on base-sized models as well as utilizing state-of-the-art summarization specific pretraining from Pegasus [107] on large-sized models. The results of training BIGBIRD sparse encoder along with full decoder on these long document datasets are presented in Tab. 4. We can clearly see modeling longer context brings significant improvement. Along with hyperparameters, we also\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the amount of time used to train the model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.

However, under standard complexity theoretic assumptions, we show that this problem will require\u03a9(n)-layers for any sparse attention layers with\u00d5(n) edges (not just BIGBIRD). (We use the standard notation\u03a9(n) to hide the dependence on poly-logarithmic factors. )\n2. As a result we propose to first blockify the attention pattern i.e. we pack sets of query and keys together and then define attention on these blocks. It is easier to explain this process using the example shown in Fig. 3. Suppose, there are 12 query and 12 key vectors to attend to. Using a block size of 2, we split the query matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks and similarly the key matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks. Then the three different building components of BIGBIRD are defined on the block matrix. In particular\n3. We demonstrate a natural task which can be solved by the full attention mechanism in O(1)-layers. However, under standard complexity theoretic assumptions, this problem requires\u03a9(n)-layers for any sparse attention layers with\u00d5(n) edges (not just BIGBIRD). (Here\u00d5 hides poly-logarthmic factors). Consider the simple problem of finding the corresponding furthest vector for each vector in the given sequence of length n. Formally, Task 1. Given n unit vectors {u 1 , . . . , u n }, find f (u 1 , . . . , u n ) \u2192 (u\n4. problem. Proposition 1. There exists a single layer full self-attention g \u2208 T H=1,m=2d,q=0 that can evaluate Task 1, i.e. g(u 1 , ..., u n ) = [u 1 * , . . . , u n * ], but for any sparse-attention graph D with\u00d5(n) edges (i.e. inner product evaluations), would require\u03a9(n 1\u2212o(1) ) layers. We give a formal proof of this fact in App. C.\n5. Proof. We will break this proof into two parts: Part 1: The full attention mechanism can solve the problem in O(1) layer We begin by providing an explicit construction of a single layer full self-attention that can evaluate Task 1.\nStep 1 We embed each u i in the input into R 2d as follows:\nx i := E(u i ) = [u i ; 0](9)\nStep 2 Construct query, key, value functions as follows:\nQ([a; b]) = \u2212a K([a; b]) = a V ([a; b]) = [0; a](10)\nThen Attn(Q(x i ), K(X), V (X) = [0; u arg max j \u2212ui,uj ]. Then,\n6. We use four publicly available datasets Books [110], CC-News [34], Stories [89] and Wikipedia to pretrain BIGBIRD. We borrow the sentencepiece vocabulary as RoBERTa (which is in turn borrowed from GPT2). We split any document longer than 4096 into multiple documents and we join documents that were much smaller than 4096. Following the original BERT training, we mask 15% of tokens in these four datasets, and train to predict the mask. We warm start from RoBERTa's checkpoint. We train two different models:\n7. We prefix and append each example with [CLS] and [SEP] token respectively. The output corresponding to the [CLS] token from BIGBIRD transformer encoder is fed to a simple binary classification layer. We fine-tune the pretrained BIGBIRD from App. F.1 using hyper-parameters described in Tab. 21. We note that high performance is not surprising due to the overlap in the nature of negative example generation and MLM pretraining.\n8. As these tasks are very competitive, multiple highly engineered systems have been designed specific each dataset confirming to respective output formats. For a fair comparison, we had to use some additional regularization for training BIGBIRD, details of which are provided in App. E.2 along with exact architecture description. We experiment using the base sized model and select the best configuration on the development set for each dataset (as reported in Tab. 2).

Empirically, BIGBIRD gives state-of-the-art performance on a number of NLP tasks\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the model architecture and objective about the model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent. If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "The model `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` is based on the BigBird architecture, which is a sparse-attention-based transformer model. This model extends the capabilities of traditional transformer models, such as BERT, to handle much longer sequences of text. The architecture utilizes a generalized attention mechanism that operates on input sequences by blockifying the attention pattern. This means that sets of query and key vectors are packed together into blocks, and attention is defined on these blocks, allowing for efficient processing of long documents.\n\nThe BigBird model incorporates three key components in its attention mechanism:\n\n1. Each query attends to a fixed number of random keys (`r` random keys).\n2. Each query attends to a fixed number of tokens to its left and right, creating a sliding window attention pattern where the width of the window is `w`, and the query at location `i` attends from `i - w/2` to `i + w/2`.\n3. The model includes global tokens (`g` global tokens) that can attend to the entire sequence, which helps in capturing the context better.\n\nThe objective of the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model is to provide state-of-the-art performance on natural language processing (NLP) tasks, with a particular focus on question answering and document summarization. The model has been pretrained and fine-tuned on the BigPatent dataset, which consists of long documents, making it particularly well-suited for tasks that require understanding and summarizing extensive text.\n\nThe model is built upon the Pegasus Encoder-Decoder Transformer in large size (`bigbp_large`), which follows the original implementation of Pegasus with pre-normalization and separate encoder-decoder weights. The BigBird model is designed to be a universal approximator of sequence-to-sequence functions and is Turing complete, thanks to the inclusion of extra global tokens that preserve the expressive power of the model.\n\nIn summary, the `google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent` model combines the BigBird sparse attention mechanism with the Pegasus architecture to handle longer contexts and improve performance on NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization, particularly for long documents like patents."}
