While the specific training procedures for `hustvl/yolos-tiny` may not be publicly detailed, we can infer some general practices based on the typical training procedures for DETR-based models and the common practices for training small or \"tiny\" versions of larger models.\n\n1. **Dataset**: DETR-based models are usually trained on large-scale object detection datasets such as COCO (Common Objects in COntext), which contains a diverse set of images with annotated objects across various categories.\n\n2. **Pre-training**: The model might be pre-trained on a large dataset like ImageNet for the backbone network to learn general visual features before being fine-tuned on the object detection task.\n\n3. **Backbone Network**: For a \"tiny\" version, the backbone network is typically a smaller and more efficient version of the standard backbone used in larger models. This could be a smaller ResNet or a mobile-friendly architecture like MobileNet or EfficientNet.\n\n4. **Optimization**: The training process likely involves stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or an adaptive optimizer like Adam. Learning rate schedules, such as step decay or cosine annealing, are often used to adjust the learning rate during training.\n\n5. **Regularization**: Techniques like weight decay, dropout, and data augmentation (e.g., random cropping, flipping, scaling) are commonly employed to prevent overfitting, especially since \"tiny\" models have fewer parameters and are more prone to overfitting.\n\n6. **Loss Function**: DETR models use a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, combined with a classification loss and a bounding box regression loss.\n\n7. **Fine-tuning**: The model is fine-tuned on the object detection dataset with a focus on the specific classes and annotations relevant to the task.\n\n8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The training process involves tuning hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, weight decay, and the number of epochs to optimize performance.\n\n9. **Evaluation**: Throughout the training process, the model is evaluated on a validation set to monitor its performance and to perform early stopping if necessary to prevent overfitting.\n\n10. **Hardware and Training Time**: Training DETR-based models is computationally intensive and typically requires powerful GPUs or TPUs. The training time can vary from days to weeks, depending on the size of the dataset and the computational resources available.\n\nFor the exact training procedures, including the specific hyperparameters and training configurations used for `hustvl/yolos-tiny`, one would need to refer to the official documentation or the research paper associated with the model, if available.", "The `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model is a variant of the YOLOS (You Only Look One-level Series) family, which is based on the DETR (DEtection TRansformer) architecture adapted for object detection tasks. The \"tiny\" version of YOLOS is designed to be a smaller and faster model compared to its larger counterparts, making it more suitable for applications where computational resources are limited or real-time processing is required.\n\nHere are some basic details about the parameters of the `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model:\n\n1. **Model Size**: As a \"tiny\" version, the model has significantly fewer parameters than the base or large versions of YOLOS. This reduction in size typically means a decrease in the number of layers or the dimensionality of the layers within the transformer and feed-forward networks.\n\n2. **Architecture**: The model follows the transformer-based architecture, which includes an encoder-decoder structure. It leverages self-attention mechanisms to process the entire image as a sequence of pixels or patches, allowing it to capture global dependencies within the image.\n\n3. **Input Resolution**: The input resolution for the `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model may be lower than that of larger models to reduce computational complexity. This means that the model is optimized to work with images of a certain size, and input images may need to be resized accordingly.\n\n4. **Output**: The model outputs a set of bounding boxes along with classification scores for each detected object within the image. The number of possible object classes the model can detect is determined by the dataset it was trained on.\n\n5. **Training Parameters**: The model is trained with specific hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. These parameters are chosen to optimize the performance of the model while keeping the training time and resource usage manageable.\n\n6. **Pretraining**: Like many transformer models, `hustvl/yolos-tiny` may benefit from pretraining on a large dataset before being fine-tuned on a specific object detection task. This pretraining helps the model learn general visual features that can be adapted to various detection tasks.\n\n7. **Efficiency**: The tiny version is designed to strike a balance between detection performance and efficiency. It is optimized for scenarios where model latency and speed are critical, such as on edge devices or in mobile applications.\n\nTo get the exact number of parameters and more detailed specifications, one would typically refer to the official documentation or the research paper associated with the model.

It is important to note that as with any machine learning model, there are several disclaimers and considerations to keep in mind:\n\n1. **Performance**: The \"tiny\" version of a model usually indicates a trade-off between speed and accuracy. While it may perform faster inference compared to its larger counterparts, it might not be as accurate in detecting objects.\n\n2. **Generalization**: The model's performance is highly dependent on the data it was trained on. If the model was trained on a specific dataset, its ability to generalize to other types of data or different domains may be limited.\n\n3. **Bias and Fairness**: There is a risk of bias in any machine learning model, which can stem from the data used for training. If the training data is not representative of the real-world scenario where the model will be applied, the model's predictions could be biased.\n\n4. **Use Case Appropriateness**: The model should be used for appropriate tasks that match its capabilities and limitations. It may not be suitable for all object detection scenarios, especially those requiring high precision.\n\n5. **Updates and Maintenance**: The model's performance can degrade over time if it is not regularly updated and maintained. Changes in the type of objects it needs to detect or variations in the environment can affect its accuracy.\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations**: Depending on the application, there may be ethical considerations to take into account, such as privacy concerns and the potential for misuse.\n\n7. **Liability**: The creators or distributors of the model typically do not accept liability for any harm or damage that may occur as a result of using the model. Users should employ the model at their own risk and ensure they comply with all relevant regulations and ethical guidelines.\n\n8. **No Guarantee of Service**: The availability of the model, especially if it is hosted online, may not be guaranteed, and there could be downtime or discontinuation of service without notice.\n\nIt is crucial for users to thoroughly evaluate the model in the context of their specific use case and consider these disclaimers before integrating it into their systems or processes."]}

We study the effects of different pre-training strategies (both label-supervised and self-supervised) when transferring ViT (DeiT-Ti and DeiT-S) from ImageNet-1k to the COCO object detection benchmark via YOLOS. For object detection, the input shorter size is 512 for tiny models and is 800 for small models during inference. The results are shown in Tab. 2 and Tab. 3.  [18,44,45]. In vision, pioneering works [12,21] train self-supervised Transformers following the masked auto-encoding paradigm in NLP. Recent\n9. As for the model design, YOLOS closely follows the original ViT architecture [21], and is optimized for object detection in the same vein as Carion et al. [10]. YOLOS can be easily adapted to various canonical Transformer architectures available in NLP as well as in computer vision. This intentionally simple setup is not designed for better detection performance, but to exactly reveal characteristics of the Transformer family in object detection as unbiased as possible.\n10. Comparisons with Tiny-sized CNN Detectors. As shown in Tab. 5, the tiny-sized YOLOS model achieves impressive performance compared with well-established and highly-optimized CNN object detectors. YOLOS-Ti is strong in AP and competitive in FLOPs & FPS even though Transformer is not intentionally designed to optimize these factors. From the model scaling perspective [20,56,61], YOLOS-Ti can serve as a promising model scaling start point.\n11. Can Transformer perform 2D object-and region-level recognition from a pure sequence-to-sequence perspective with minimal knowledge about the 2D spatial structure? To answer this question, we present You Only Look at One Sequence (YOLOS), a series of object detection models based on the vanilla Vision Transformer with the fewest possible modifications, region priors, as well as inductive biases of the target task. We find that YOLOS pre-trained on the mid-sized ImageNet-1k dataset only can already achieve\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide basic details about the model hustvl/yolos-tiny.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Model Name: hustvl/yolos-tiny\n\n### Model Architecture:\n- The hustvl/yolos-tiny model is a part of the YOLOS (You Only Look at One Sequence) series, which is based on the vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with minimal modifications for object detection.\n- The detector head of YOLOS is simple, resembling the image classification layer of ViT, and uses a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers and ReLU activation functions for both classification and bounding box regression.\n- YOLOS employs [DET] tokens, inspired by DETR, to represent objects without relying on 2D structure inductive biases or task-specific heuristics.\n- The model avoids additional inductive biases by not using non-degenerated convolutions (e.g., 3x3) on top of ViT and maintains a pure sequence-to-sequence approach for object detection.\n\n### Training Procedures:\n- Pre-training: YOLOS models, including the tiny version, are pre-trained on the ImageNet-1k dataset using a data-efficient training strategy. The parameters are initialized with a truncated normal distribution and optimized using AdamW. The learning rate is set to 1x10^-3, and the batch size is 1024, with cosine learning rate decay and a weight decay of 0.05. Data augmentation techniques such as Rand-Augment and random erasing are employed.\n- Fine-tuning: The model is fine-tuned on the COCO object detection benchmark. All parameters are initialized from ImageNet-1k pre-trained weights except for the MLP heads and [DET] tokens, which are randomly initialized. Training is performed on a single node with 8x12G GPUs, with a learning rate of 2.5x10^-5, a batch size of 8, cosine learning rate decay, and weight decay.\n\n### Parameters:\n- The model uses ImageNet-1k pre-trained weights for initialization, except for the newly introduced components for object detection, which are randomly initialized.\n- The input resolution for tiny models during inference is 512 for the shorter side.\n\n### Important Disclaimers:\n- The YOLOS design is not aimed at achieving the best detection performance but rather to explore the capabilities of Transformers in object detection with minimal biases.\n- The tiny-sized YOLOS model demonstrates impressive performance compared to tiny-sized CNN detectors, showing promise as a starting point for model scaling.\n- The model's versatility and transferability from image recognition to object detection are highlighted, with minimal knowledge about the input spatial structure.\n- [More Information Needed] for any additional disclaimers not covered by the provided references.\n\n### Contact Information:\n- For updates or inquiries regarding the model card, please contact the project organizer (the role you are assuming in this scenario).\n\n(Note: The above model card description is based on the provided references and may require additional details or updates based on the latest information available on the Huggingface model repository or from the model development team.)"}

Thanks for their wonderful works.\n3. In object detection and many other computer vision benchmarks, the image resolutions as well as the aspect ratios are usually not fixed as the image classification task. Due to the changes in input resolutions & aspect ratios (sequence length) from the image classification task to the object detection task, the position embedding (PE) in ViT / YOLOS has also to be changed and adapted 4 . The changes in PE could affect the model size and performance. In this work, we study two types of PE settings for YOLOS:\n4. Type-I PE. This setting adds PE to the input of each Transformer layer following DETR [10], and the PE considering the inputs as a sequence of patches in the raster order following ViT [21]. Specifically, during fine-tuning, the PE of the first layer is interpolated from the pre-trained one, and the PEs for the rest intermediate layers are randomly initialized and trained from scratch. In our paper, small-and base-sized models use this setting. The detailed configurations are given in Tab. 8.\n5. In the paper, small-and base-sized models use this setting. \u2022 Type-II interpolates the pre-trained 1D learnable PE to a size similar to or slightly larger than the input size, and adds no PE in intermediate Transformer layers. In the paper, tiny-sized models use this setting.\nIn a word, Type-I uses more PEs and Type-II uses larger PE.\n6. As for the model design, YOLOS closely follows the original ViT architecture [21], and is optimized for object detection in the same vein as Carion et al. [10].

From the model scaling perspective [20,56,61], YOLOS-Ti can serve as a promising model scaling start point.\n10. Interpreting the Results. Although the performance is seemingly discouraging, the numbers are meaningful, as YOLOS is not purposefully designed for better performance, but designed to precisely reveal the transferability of ViT in object detection. E.g., YOLOS-B is directly adopted from the BERT-Base architecture [18] in NLP. This 12 layers, 768 channels Transformer along with its variants have shown impressive performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.

Fine-tuning. We fine-tune all YOLOS models on COCO object detection benchmark [36] in a similar way as Carion et al. [10]. All the parameters are initialized from ImageNet-1k pre-trained weights except for the MLP heads for classification & bounding box regression as well as one hundred [DET] tokens, which are randomly initialized. We train YOLOS on a single node with 8 \u00d7 12G GPUs. The learning rate and batch sizes are 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 8 respectively. The learning rate decay is cosine and the weight decay\n2. Pre-training. We pre-train all YOLOS / ViT models on ImageNet-1k [51] dataset using the dataefficient training strategy suggested by Touvron et al. [58]. The parameters are initialized with a truncated normal distribution and optimized using AdamW [40]. The learning rate and batch size are 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 1024, respectively. The learning rate decay is cosine and the weight decay is 0.05. Rand-Augment [14] and random erasing [70] implemented by timm library [65] are used for data augmentation. Stochastic depth\n3.

For small and base models, we resize the input images such that the shortest side is at least 480 and at most 800 pixels while the longest at most 1333. We also apply random crop augmentations during training following Carion et al. [10]. The number of [DET] tokens are 100 and we keep the loss function as well as loss weights the same as DETR, while we don't apply dropout [54] or stochastic depth during fine-tuning since we find these regularization methods hurt performance.\n5.

This dataset should include images and corresponding annotations that define the bounding boxes and class labels for the objects of interest.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess your dataset to match the input format expected by the model. This may include resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and converting annotations to the format required by YOLOS.\n\n3. **Model Configuration**: Load the pre-trained `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model. Adjust the final layers of the model to match the number of classes in your dataset.

This includes the learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and any data augmentation techniques.\n\n5. **Transfer Learning**: Initialize the model with the pre-trained weights, except for the layers that have been adjusted for the new number of classes. These layers should be initialized randomly.\n\n6. **Training**: Train the model on your dataset. Initially, you might freeze the weights of the earlier layers and only train the new layers to prevent overfitting. After some epochs, you can start fine-tuning the entire model by unfreezing all the layers and continuing the training with a lower learning rate.\n\n7. **Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate the model on a validation set to monitor its performance. Use metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) to gauge how well the model is detecting objects.\n\n8. **Iteration**: Based on the evaluation, you may need to iterate on steps 4 through 7, adjusting hyperparameters and potentially augmenting the dataset to improve performance.\n\n9. **Deployment**: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed for inference on new data.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively fine-tune the `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model for a new object detection task, leveraging the power of transfer learning to achieve high accuracy with less computational resources and training time compared to training a model from scratch.\n\n--- \n\nRemember that fine-tuning is both an art and a science, requiring experimentation and iteration to achieve the best results for your specific task.", "The model `hustvl/yolos-tiny` is a lightweight variant of the YOLOS (You Only Look One-level Series) family, which is based on the DETR (DEtection TRansformer) architecture for object detection tasks.

You would need to adjust the dataset path, batch size, learning rate, and other parameters as necessary for your specific use case.\n\nHere is a code snippet for fine-tuning the `YOLOS-Ti` model, which is the tiny variant of YOLOS, as per the provided references:\n\n```python\npython -m torch.distributed.launch \\\n    --nproc_per_node=8 \\\n    --use_env main.py \\\n    --coco_path /path/to/coco \\\n    --batch_size 2 \\\n    --lr 5e-5 \\\n    --epochs 300 \\\n    --backbone_name tiny \\\n    --pre_trained /path/to/deit-tiny.pth \\\n    --eval_size 512\n```\n\nPlease note that the above command is for training on the COCO dataset, and you would need to replace `/path/to/coco` with the path to your specific dataset and `/path/to/deit-tiny.pth` with the path to the pre-trained weights for the tiny model. Adjustments to the batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs may also be necessary depending on your dataset and computational resources.\n\nFor integration into an application, you would load the fine-tuned model and use it to make predictions on new images. However, since a direct code block for inference is not provided in the references, I would say [More Information Needed] for the exact code snippet for this part."}

It may not perform as well as its larger counterparts on complex object detection tasks with high precision and recall requirements.\n\n2. **Simplified Architecture**: The simplification of the architecture to reduce size and increase speed means that the model has fewer parameters and layers. This can limit its ability to learn and generalize from more complex or diverse datasets.\n\n3. **Limited Feature Extraction**: With fewer layers, the model's capacity for feature extraction is reduced. This can affect its performance on detecting small or intricate objects within an image.\n\n4. **Overfitting on Simple Datasets**: Due to its smaller size, the model might overfit on simpler datasets and fail to generalize well to more complex real-world scenarios.\n\n5. **Resource Constraints**: While designed for efficiency, the model still requires a certain level of computational resource.

For instance, an adversary could use adversarial examples to trick the model into not detecting certain objects, potentially leading to security breaches.\n\n4. **Misuse**: The model could be used for malicious purposes, such as developing or enhancing surveillance systems by authoritarian regimes to monitor and suppress dissent, or by individuals for stalking or other invasive activities.\n\n5. **Reliability and Safety**: In scenarios where object detection is critical for safety, such as autonomous driving or medical diagnostics, the \"tiny\" version of the model may not provide the necessary accuracy and reliability, potentially leading to harmful consequences.\n\n6. **Economic Impact**: The automation of object detection tasks could lead to job displacement in certain industries, affecting the livelihoods of individuals who perform those tasks.\n\n7. **Legal and Ethical Implications**: The use of automated object detection in legal contexts, such as evidence collection or law enforcement, could raise ethical and legal concerns, especially if the model's outputs are considered without human oversight.\n\nIt is important for developers and users of the \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" model to be aware of these potential harms and to implement measures to mitigate them, such as ensuring diverse and representative training data, establishing clear usage policies, and maintaining transparency and accountability in the model's deployment.", "The model \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" is a machine learning model designed for object detection tasks. It is a variant of the YOLOS (You Only Look One-level Series) family, which is based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, known for its speed and efficiency in detecting objects in images. The \"tiny\" version is a smaller and faster model that trades some accuracy for increased speed, making it suitable for applications where computational resources are limited or real-time detection is required.\n\nMisunderstandings related to the \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" model may arise due to several factors:\n\n1. **Expectation of Accuracy**: Users might expect the \"tiny\" model to be as accurate as its larger counterparts. However, due to its reduced size and complexity, \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" may not perform as well on certain tasks or datasets compared to the full-sized models.\n\n2. **Generalization**: Some may believe that the model can generalize across all types of object detection tasks without any fine-tuning. In reality, while the model is pre-trained, it may require additional training or fine-tuning on a specific dataset to achieve optimal performance for a particular use case.\n\n3. **Real-time Performance**: There might be an assumption that \"tiny\" models will always work in real-time on any device. The actual speed can vary depending on the hardware specifications of the device it is running on.\n\n4. **Use Case Appropriateness**: Users might misunderstand the best use cases for \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\". It is designed for scenarios where speed is crucial and some loss in accuracy is acceptable. It may not be the best choice for applications requiring very high precision.\n\n5. **Training and Inference**: There could be confusion about the difference between training the model and using it for inference. Training requires significant computational resources and a dataset, while inference is the process of using the trained model to detect objects in new images.\n\n6. **Limitations of Tiny Models**: Some users might not be aware of the limitations inherent to smaller models, such as reduced feature extraction capabilities, which can lead to less robust performance in complex scenarios.\n\nUnderstanding these potential misunderstandings can help users set realistic expectations and apply the \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" model more effectively in their object detection tasks.", "The model \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" is a variant of the YOLOS (You Only Look One-level Series) family, which is designed to be a lightweight and efficient object detection model.

It may not perform as well as its larger counterparts on complex object detection tasks with high precision and recall requirements.\n\n2. **Simplified Architecture**: The simplification of the architecture to reduce size and increase speed means that the model has fewer parameters and layers. This can limit its ability to learn and generalize from more complex or diverse datasets.\n\n3. **Limited Feature Extraction**: With fewer layers, the model's capacity for feature extraction is reduced. This can affect its performance on detecting small or intricate objects within an image.\n\n4. **Overfitting on Simple Datasets**: Due to its smaller size, the model might overfit on simpler datasets and fail to generalize well to more complex real-world scenarios.\n\n5. **Resource Constraints**: While designed for efficiency, the model still requires a certain level of computational resource. On very low-power devices or systems with strict latency requirements, even the \"tiny\" version might not be suitable.\n\n6. **Robustness and Generalization**: The model might not be as robust to variations in object scale, lighting conditions, occlusions, and background clutter as more complex models.\n\n7. **Limited Contextual Understanding**: The reduced complexity might also limit the model's ability to understand context within an image, which is often crucial for accurate object detection.\n\n8. **Dataset Bias**: If the model is trained on a limited or biased dataset, its predictions may not generalize well to other types of data, which is a common limitation for many machine learning models.\n\n9. **Transferability**: The model's ability to transfer learning to different domains or tasks without significant retraining might be limited compared to more complex models.\n\n10. **Update and Maintenance**: As with any model, keeping it up-to-date with the latest research and data can be challenging, and there may be limitations in how the model can be updated or fine-tuned.\n\nIn summary, while \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" offers advantages in terms of efficiency, these come at the cost of reduced accuracy, feature extraction capabilities, and generalization compared to larger, more complex models. Users should consider these trade-offs when choosing this model for their object detection tasks.", "The model \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" is a machine learning model designed for object detection tasks, and like any other technological tool, it comes with certain sociotechnical limitations. These limitations are a result of the interplay between the social context in which the model is used and the technical aspects of the model itself.\n\n1. **Data Bias and Fairness**: The model's performance is highly dependent on the data it was trained on. If the training data is not diverse or representative of the real-world scenarios where the model will be applied, the model may exhibit biases. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, particularly if the model is used in sensitive applications such as surveillance or in industries like recruitment or law enforcement.\n\n2. **Transparency and Explainability**: As a deep learning model, \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" can be considered a \"black box,\" meaning its decision-making process is not easily interpretable by humans. This lack of transparency can be a significant issue in applications where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial, such as in healthcare or criminal justice.\n\n3. **Privacy Concerns**: Object detection models can be used in ways that infringe on individual privacy. For instance, when employed in public surveillance systems, there is a risk of unauthorized tracking or profiling of individuals without their consent.\n\n4. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: The deployment of advanced models like \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" requires significant computational resources, which may not be accessible to all users or organizations, especially those in low-income regions.

Some instantiations are shown in Tab. 9. In the paper, tiny-sized models use this setting. This type of PE is more promising, and we will make a profound study about this setting in the future.\n5. To control the model size, these intermediate PE sizes are usually set to be smaller than the input sequence length, e.g., for typical models YOLOS-S and YOLOS-S (dwr), the PE size is 512 16 \u00d7 864 16 . Since the dwr scaling is more parameter friendly compared with other model scaling approaches, we use a larger PE for YOLOS-S (dwr) than other small-sized models to compensate for the number of parameters. For larger models such as YOLOS-Base, we do not consider the model size so we also choose to use larger\n6. Vision Transformer for Object Detection. There has been a lot of interest in combining CNNs with forms of self-attention mechanisms [4] to improve object detection performance [9,31,64], while recent works trend towards augmenting Transformer with CNNs (or CNN design). Beal et al. [6] propose to use a pre-trained ViT as the feature extractor for a Faster R-CNN [50] object detector. Despite being effective, they fail to ablate the CNN architectures, region-wise pooling operations [23,25,27] as well as\n7. hand-crafted components such as dense anchors [50] and NMS. Inspired by modern CNN architecture, some works [39,60,63,66] introduce the pyramidal feature hierarchy and locality to Vision Transformer design, which largely boost the performance in dense prediction tasks including object detection. However, these architectures are performance-oriented and cannot reflect the properties of the canonical or vanilla Vision Transformer [21] that directly inherited from Vaswani et al. [59]. Another series of work,\n8. mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (e.g, ImageNet-1k [51], CIFAR-10/100 [34], etc.) when pre-trained at sufficient scale (e.g, JFT-300M [55], ImageNet-21k [17]). Touvron et al. [58] achieves competitive Top-1 accuracy by training Transformer on ImageNet-1k only, and is also capable of transferring to smaller datasets [34,42,43]. However, existing transfer learning literature of Transformer arrest in image-level recognition and does not touch more complex tasks in vision such as object\n9.

Although the randomly initialized intermediate PEs do not introduce additional inductive biases, they do require learning positional relations from scratch, which could be computationally expensive.\n\n3. **Lack of Few-shot or Zero-shot Learning**: Unlike state-of-the-art language models that can adapt to new scenarios with little to no labeled data, as stated in reference 3, YOLOS still requires substantial supervision to transfer to downstream tasks, limiting its flexibility and ease of deployment in new domains.\n\n4. **PEs in Tiny-sized Models**: Reference 4 suggests that using a large enough PE in the first layer might make intermediate PEs redundant. This is an area that requires further research, and the current instantiation may not be optimal.\n\n5. **Model Scaling and Parameter Efficiency**: Reference 5 discusses the trade-offs in controlling model size and parameter efficiency, indicating that there may be a balance to strike between model complexity and computational resources.\n\n**Sociotechnical Considerations:**\n\n1. **Potential for Misunderstanding**: Reference 11 indicates that the performance of YOLOS may seem discouraging, but it is designed to reveal the transferability of ViT in object detection.

We hope the introduction of Transformer can not only unify NLP and CV in terms of the architecture, but also in terms of the methodology. The proposed YOLOS is able to turn a pre-trained ViT into an object detector with the fewest possible modifications, but our ultimate goal is to adapt a pre-trained model to downstream vision tasks with the fewest possible costs.

To control the model size, these intermediate PE sizes are usually set to be smaller than the input sequence length, e.g., for typical models YOLOS-S and YOLOS-S (dwr), the PE size is 512 16 \u00d7 864 16 . Since the dwr scaling is more parameter friendly compared with other model scaling approaches, we use a larger PE for YOLOS-S (dwr) than other small-sized models to compensate for the number of parameters.

Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references, here are the recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model hustvl/yolos-tiny:\n\n1. **Transfer Learning Efficiency**: The YOLOS model requires 150 epochs of transfer learning to adapt a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to perform object detection (Ref. 1). This indicates a significant computational cost for adaptation. It is recommended to explore methods to reduce the number of epochs required for transfer learning, possibly by investigating more efficient fine-tuning techniques or by leveraging more targeted pre-training.\n\n2. **Supervision Requirement**: Unlike state-of-the-art language models that can perform few-shot or zero-shot learning, YOLOS and other pre-trained computer vision models still require substantial supervision to transfer to downstream tasks (Ref. 2). It is recommended to investigate strategies to reduce the supervision needed, such as semi-supervised or unsupervised learning approaches that could leverage unlabeled data more effectively.\n\n3. **Positional Encoding (PE) Optimization**: The model uses a large PE in the first layer, which is a promising setting that will be studied more in the future (Ref. 3). It is recommended to continue research on optimizing PEs, especially considering the trade-off between model size and the ability to handle multi-scale inputs or inputs with varying sizes and aspect ratios (Ref. 5).\n\n4. **Model Size and Efficiency**: The YOLOS-Ti model is competitive in terms of average precision (AP), floating-point operations per second (FLOPs), and frames per second (FPS) when compared to tiny-sized CNN detectors (Ref. 6). However, it is noted that about one-third of the model weights are dedicated to providing positional information (Ref. 5). It is recommended to explore ways to reduce the model size without compromising performance, possibly by investigating more parameter-efficient positional encoding methods or model pruning techniques.\n\n5. **Interpretation of Results**: The YOLOS model is not designed for peak performance but rather to reveal the characteristics of the Transformer family in object detection (Ref. 7, 8). It is important to communicate this clearly to potential users, emphasizing that the model serves as a research tool to understand transferability and that there may be better-performing models for practical applications.\n\n6. **Ethical and Societal Considerations**: As a sociotechnic, it is crucial to consider the broader implications of deploying object detection models like YOLOS-Ti. This includes addressing potential biases in the training data, ensuring privacy and ethical use of the technology, and being transparent about the model's limitations. It is recommended to conduct thorough bias and fairness assessments and to provide clear guidelines for ethical usage.\n\nIn summary, while the YOLOS-Ti model shows promise, there are several areas for improvement, particularly in terms of transfer learning efficiency, supervision requirements, model size optimization, and ethical considerations. Further research and development are needed to address these issues."}

YOLOS integrates the DETR's transformer-based architecture with the BERT's tokenization process for visual tokens.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the term \"tokenization\" in the context of computer vision models like YOLOS differs from the tokenization process in natural language processing (NLP). In NLP, tokenization typically refers to the process of converting text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, which can then be processed by models like BERT.\n\nIn the case of `hustvl/yolos-tiny`, the tokenization process involves converting the input image into a sequence of fixed-size non-overlapping patches. These patches are then flattened and linearly projected into an embedding space to create visual tokens. The process is as follows:\n\n1. **Image Preprocessing**: The input image is resized to a fixed resolution that the model expects, typically using interpolation methods to maintain the aspect ratio.\n\n2. **Patching**: The preprocessed image is divided into a grid of S x S patches. For example, if the input image is of size 224 x 224 pixels and the patch size is set to 16 x 16 pixels, this would result in a grid of 14 x 14 patches.\n\n3. **Flattening**: Each patch is flattened into a 1D vector. If the patch size is 16 x 16 pixels and the image has 3 color channels (RGB), each patch would be flattened into a vector of 16 * 16 * 3 = 768 elements.\n\n4. **Linear Projection**: The flattened patches are then passed through a linear layer that projects them into a D-dimensional space, where D is the dimensionality of the model's embeddings. This step is akin to creating word embeddings in NLP.\n\n5. **Positional Encoding**: Since the transformer architecture does not inherently capture the order of the input sequence, positional encodings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information. These encodings can be learned or fixed (e.g., sine and cosine functions of different frequencies).\n\n6. **Prepending Class Token**: A special [CLS] token is prepended to the sequence of visual tokens. This token is used to aggregate information across the patches and is typically the one used for predicting the class of the object during the detection task.\n\nAfter this tokenization process, the sequence of visual tokens, along with the [CLS] token, is fed into the transformer encoder-decoder architecture of the YOLOS model. The transformer processes these tokens to capture the relationships between different parts of the image and ultimately outputs predictions for object detection tasks.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that `hustvl/yolos-tiny` is a smaller and more efficient version of the YOLOS family, designed to provide a balance between speed and accuracy, making it suitable for environments with limited computational resources.", "The model `hustvl/yolos-tiny` is a variant of the YOLOS (You Only Look One-level Series) family, which is based on the DETR (DEtection TRansformer) architecture for object detection tasks. YOLOS integrates the transformer architecture into object detection, and the \"tiny\" variant refers to a smaller, more efficient version suitable for environments where computational resources are limited.\n\nWhen preparing data for the `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model, the resizing and rewriting process is crucial to ensure that the input data is in the correct format and dimensionality that the model expects. Here's a general overview of the steps involved in this process:\n\n1. **Image Resizing**: Input images must be resized to match the input size expected by the model. For `hustvl/yolos-tiny`, this typically involves scaling the images to a fixed size, such as 640x640 pixels, while maintaining the aspect ratio. Padding might be added to the images to achieve the desired size without distorting the image content.\n\n2. **Normalization**: After resizing, the pixel values of the images are usually normalized. This means adjusting the range of pixel intensity values to a scale that the model is trained on, often [0, 1] or [-1, 1], by dividing by 255 if the original range is [0, 255]. Sometimes, mean subtraction and division by standard deviation (based on the dataset statistics) are also performed for each color channel.\n\n3. **Annotation Transformation**: Object detection models require annotations that include bounding box coordinates and class labels for each object in the image. During the resizing process, these annotations must be transformed accordingly. If an image is resized, the bounding box coordinates must be scaled to match the new image dimensions.\n\n4. **Data Augmentation (optional)**: To improve the robustness of the model, data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, or color jittering may be applied. These augmentations must be reflected in the annotations as well.\n\n5. **Rewriting Data**: Once the images and annotations are processed, they are typically rewritten into a format that is compatible with the training pipeline. This could involve converting them into a set of tensors and storing them in a binary format like TFRecord for TensorFlow or a custom dataset class for PyTorch.\n\n6. **Batching**: Finally, the processed images and annotations are grouped into batches.

{"question": "preprocessing", "chain": "retrieval", "prompt": ["The model `hustvl/yolos-tiny` is a variant of the YOLOS (You Only Look One-level Series) architecture, which is a family of models inspired by the DETR (DEtection TRansformer) approach for object detection tasks. YOLOS integrates the DETR's transformer-based architecture with the BERT's tokenization process for visual tokens.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the term \"tokenization\" in the context of computer vision models like YOLOS differs from the tokenization process in natural language processing (NLP). In NLP, tokenization typically refers to the process of converting text into smaller units, such as words or subwords, which can then be processed by models like BERT.\n\nIn the case of `hustvl/yolos-tiny`, the tokenization process involves converting the input image into a sequence of fixed-size non-overlapping patches. These patches are then flattened and linearly projected into an embedding space to create visual tokens. The process is as follows:\n\n1. **Image Preprocessing**: The input image is resized to a fixed resolution that the model expects, typically using interpolation methods to maintain the aspect ratio.\n\n2. **Patching**: The preprocessed image is divided into a grid of S x S patches. For example, if the input image is of size 224 x 224 pixels and the patch size is set to 16 x 16 pixels, this would result in a grid of 14 x 14 patches.\n\n3. **Flattening**: Each patch is flattened into a 1D vector. If the patch size is 16 x 16 pixels and the image has 3 color channels (RGB), each patch would be flattened into a vector of 16 * 16 * 3 = 768 elements.\n\n4. **Linear Projection**: The flattened patches are then passed through a linear layer that projects them into a D-dimensional space, where D is the dimensionality of the model's embeddings. This step is akin to creating word embeddings in NLP.\n\n5. **Positional Encoding**: Since the transformer architecture does not inherently capture the order of the input sequence, positional encodings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information. These encodings can be learned or fixed (e.g., sine and cosine functions of different frequencies).\n\n6. **Prepending Class Token**: A special [CLS] token is prepended to the sequence of visual tokens. This token is used to aggregate information across the patches and is typically the one used for predicting the class of the object during the detection task.\n\nAfter this tokenization process, the sequence of visual tokens, along with the [CLS] token, is fed into the transformer encoder-decoder architecture of the YOLOS model. The transformer processes these tokens to capture the relationships between different parts of the image and ultimately outputs predictions for object detection tasks.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that `hustvl/yolos-tiny` is a smaller and more efficient version of the YOLOS family, designed to provide a balance between speed and accuracy, making it suitable for environments with limited computational resources.", "The model `hustvl/yolos-tiny` is a variant of the YOLOS (You Only Look One-level Series) family, which is based on the DETR (DEtection TRansformer) architecture for object detection tasks. YOLOS integrates the transformer architecture into object detection, and the \"tiny\" variant refers to a smaller, more efficient version suitable for environments where computational resources are limited.\n\nWhen preparing data for the `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model, the resizing and rewriting process is crucial to ensure that the input data is in the correct format and dimensionality that the model expects. Here's a general overview of the steps involved in this process:\n\n1. **Image Resizing**: Input images must be resized to match the input size expected by the model. For `hustvl/yolos-tiny`, this typically involves scaling the images to a fixed size, such as 640x640 pixels, while maintaining the aspect ratio. Padding might be added to the images to achieve the desired size without distorting the image content.\n\n2. **Normalization**: After resizing, the pixel values of the images are usually normalized. This means adjusting the range of pixel intensity values to a scale that the model is trained on, often [0, 1] or [-1, 1], by dividing by 255 if the original range is [0, 255]. Sometimes, mean subtraction and division by standard deviation (based on the dataset statistics) are also performed for each color channel.\n\n3. **Annotation Transformation**: Object detection models require annotations that include bounding box coordinates and class labels for each object in the image. During the resizing process, these annotations must be transformed accordingly. If an image is resized, the bounding box coordinates must be scaled to match the new image dimensions.\n\n4. **Data Augmentation (optional)**: To improve the robustness of the model, data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, or color jittering may be applied. These augmentations must be reflected in the annotations as well.\n\n5. **Rewriting Data**: Once the images and annotations are processed, they are typically rewritten into a format that is compatible with the training pipeline. This could involve converting them into a set of tensors and storing them in a binary format like TFRecord for TensorFlow or a custom dataset class for PyTorch.\n\n6. **Batching**: Finally, the processed images and annotations are grouped into batches. This is a form of rewriting where multiple data points are combined into a single tensor to be passed through the model during training or inference.\n\nIt's important to note that the exact resizing and rewriting process can vary depending on the specific implementation and the framework used.

Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "The preprocessing steps for the data used in the `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model involve several key stages, as can be inferred from the provided references:\n\n1. **Image Resizing and Patch Extraction**: As per reference 5 and 7, input images are first resized such that the shortest side is at least 480 pixels and at most 800 pixels, while the longest side is at most 1333 pixels. The images are then reshaped into a sequence of flattened 2D image patches (`x_PATCH`). The resolution of each image patch is `(P, P)`, and the number of patches `N` is determined by the formula `N = HW / P^2`, where `H` and `W` are the height and width of the resized image, and `C` is the number of input channels.\n\n2. **Tokenization**: Reference 1 describes the tokenization process where the image patches are projected to `D` dimensions with a trainable linear projection (`E`). These projected patches are referred to as `[PATCH]` tokens. Additionally, one hundred randomly initialized learnable `[DET]` tokens are appended to the `[PATCH]` tokens to serve as proxies for object representations.\n\n3. **Position Embeddings**: Position embeddings are added to all input tokens to retain positional information, following the standard learnable 1D position embeddings as mentioned in reference 1.\n\n4. **Data Augmentation**: During training, random crop augmentations are applied as stated in reference 7. Additionally, reference 8 mentions the use of Rand-Augment and random erasing for data augmentation during the pre-training phase on the ImageNet-1k dataset.\n\n5. **Normalization and Other Preprocessing Steps**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided references, it is common practice in deep learning models to normalize the image data before feeding it into the network. This typically involves scaling pixel values to a range of [0, 1] or normalizing them based on the dataset's mean and standard deviation. [More Information Needed] for specific normalization details used in `hustvl/yolos-tiny`.\n\n6. **Fine-tuning**: Reference 6 indicates that the model is fine-tuned on the COCO object detection benchmark, with all parameters initialized from ImageNet-1k pre-trained weights except for the MLP heads and the `[DET]` tokens, which are randomly initialized.\n\nThe above steps outline the preprocessing pipeline for the `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model based on the provided references. It is important to note that specific implementation details such as the exact patch size `(P, P)`, the dimension `D` to which patches are projected, and the normalization parameters would be necessary to replicate the preprocessing exactly.

The \"tiny\" version indicates that the model is optimized for environments where computational resources are limited, such as on edge devices or when real-time processing is required.\n\nThroughput is a measure of how many units of information a system can process in a given amount of time. For neural network models like hustvl/yolos-tiny, throughput is often measured in terms of the number of images that can be processed per second. The actual throughput of the model can vary depending on several factors, including:\n\n1. Hardware: The type of GPU or CPU, memory bandwidth, and other hardware specifications can significantly impact the throughput of the model.\n\n2. Input Resolution: The size of the input images affects the amount of computation required. Smaller images can be processed faster, leading to higher throughput.\n\n3. Batch Size: Processing multiple images at once (batch processing) can increase throughput as it allows for more efficient use of the hardware resources.\n\n4. Software Optimizations: The use of optimized libraries, frameworks, and model-specific optimizations can also affect the throughput.\n\n5. Precision: The numerical precision (e.g., FP32, FP16, INT8) used in computations can impact both the speed and accuracy of the model. Lower precision can lead to higher throughput but may reduce accuracy.\n\nSince the \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" model is designed to be lightweight, it is expected to have a relatively high throughput compared to larger, more complex models. However, to obtain specific throughput metrics, one would need to benchmark the model on the target hardware with the desired configuration (input resolution, batch size, precision, etc.). These benchmarks are typically performed using tools that measure the model's performance in a controlled environment to provide a clear understanding of its throughput capabilities.", "The model `hustvl/yolos-tiny` is a machine learning model that is likely a variant of the YOLOS (You Only Look One-level Series) architecture, which is a family of object detection models. The \"tiny\" designation suggests that this particular model is a smaller, more efficient version of the original YOLOS model, designed to be faster and require less computational power, making it suitable for applications with limited resources or real-time processing needs.\n\nRegarding the start or end time of the model, this typically refers to the training period or the lifecycle of the model's development and usage. However, without specific context or access to the model's repository and documentation, it's not possible to provide exact dates or times.\n\nIf you are looking for the time when the model was initially trained or released, you would typically find this information in the model's documentation, repository (such as on GitHub), or in the publication that introduced the model. The creators of the model might have provided a timestamp or a version history indicating when the model was first made available.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are inquiring about the \"end time\" in terms of when the model finishes processing an input (e.g., an image), this would depend on the specific hardware it is running on and the complexity of the input data. The \"end time\" in this context would be the moment the model completes its inference and provides the output, such as the detection of objects within an image.\n\nFor precise details about the `hustvl/yolos-tiny` model's start or end time, you would need to refer to the official documentation or contact the creators directly.

However, as a \"tiny\" model, the checkpoint is expected to be significantly smaller than those of larger models in the YOLOS family.\n\nTo get the precise checkpoint size, you would typically look at the model's repository or the platform where it's hosted, such as Hugging Face's Model Hub. If you're using the Hugging Face Transformers library, you can download the model checkpoint by using the appropriate model identifier, and the library will handle the download and caching of the model weights for you.

The \"tiny\" version indicates that the model is optimized for environments where computational resources are limited, such as on edge devices or when real-time processing is required.\n\nThroughput is a measure of how many units of information a system can process in a given amount of time. For neural network models like hustvl/yolos-tiny, throughput is often measured in terms of the number of images that can be processed per second. The actual throughput of the model can vary depending on several factors, including:\n\n1. Hardware: The type of GPU or CPU, memory bandwidth, and other hardware specifications can significantly impact the throughput of the model.\n\n2. Input Resolution: The size of the input images affects the amount of computation required. Smaller images can be processed faster, leading to higher throughput.\n\n3. Batch Size: Processing multiple images at once (batch processing) can increase throughput as it allows for more efficient use of the hardware resources.\n\n4. Software Optimizations: The use of optimized libraries, frameworks, and model-specific optimizations can also affect the throughput.\n\n5. Precision: The numerical precision (e.g., FP32, FP16, INT8) used in computations can impact both the speed and accuracy of the model. Lower precision can lead to higher throughput but may reduce accuracy.\n\nSince the \"hustvl/yolos-tiny\" model is designed to be lightweight, it is expected to have a relatively high throughput compared to larger, more complex models.

The design is intentionally simple and not aimed at achieving the best detection performance but to reveal the characteristics of the Transformer family in object detection (Reference 6). This means that the model's behavior is influenced by the inherent properties of Transformers, such as their ability to handle sequential data and their requirement for large amounts of data to generalize well.\n\n2. **Performance Sensitivity**: The model's object detection results are sensitive to the pre-training scheme, indicating that the choice of pre-training strategy can significantly influence the model's performance (Reference 7). This suggests that the domain and context in which the model is pre-trained will affect its subsequent behavior in object detection tasks.\n\n3. **Detection Token Specialization**: The [DET] tokens used by YOLOS-Ti to represent detected objects are sensitive to object locations and sizes but are insensitive to object categories (Reference 2). This characteristic implies that the model may behave differently across various population subgroups that are defined by the size and location of objects within images.\n\n4. **Transferability of ViT**: The model is designed to reveal the transferability of ViT in object detection, which was originally developed for NLP tasks (Reference 3). The transferability aspect may influence the model's behavior when detecting objects that do not align well with the patterns learned from NLP-focused architectures.\n\n5. **Fine-Tuning on COCO Benchmark**: The model is fine-tuned on the COCO object detection benchmark, which means its behavior will be influenced by the distribution of objects and scenarios present in this dataset (Reference 8). If the COCO dataset has biases or lacks representation for certain subgroups or scenarios, this will likely be reflected in the model's performance.\n\n6. **Comparison with Other Models**: YOLOS-Ti is competitive in terms of average precision (AP), FLOPs, and frames per second (FPS) when compared with other tiny-sized CNN detectors, suggesting that it can serve as a promising model scaling start point (Reference 1). However, disparities in performance may still exist when compared to more complex or differently optimized models.\n\n7. **Hardware and Inference Speed**: The FPS data is measured on a single 1080Ti GPU, which indicates that the model's behavior in terms of inference speed is influenced by the hardware used (Reference 4). This could lead to disparities in performance across different deployment environments with varying hardware capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the behavior of hustvl/yolos-tiny is influenced by its Transformer-based design, pre-training schemes, specialization of detection tokens, the COCO benchmark dataset, and the hardware used for inference. To uncover disparities in performance, evaluation should be disaggregated across factors such as object size and location, pre-training data domains, and hardware environments."}

{"question": "testing_metrics", "chain": "rev_retrieval", "prompt": ["When evaluating the performance of the hustvl/yolos-tiny model, which is a lightweight version of the YOLOS (You Only Look One-level Series) object detection model, several metrics are typically used to understand the tradeoffs between different types of errors. Here are some of the common metrics:\n\n1. **Precision**: This metric indicates the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model. It is the ratio of true positive detections to the total number of positive detections (true positives + false positives). High precision means that the model has fewer false positives but does not consider false negatives.\n\n2. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Recall measures the model's ability to detect all relevant instances. It is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. High recall indicates that the model detects most of the positive examples but does not account for the precision of those detections.\n\n3. **F1 Score**: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between the two metrics, considering both false positives and false negatives. It is particularly useful when the class distribution is imbalanced.\n\n4. **mAP (mean Average Precision)**: For object detection tasks, mAP is a common metric that averages the precision-recall curve across different thresholds and classes. It provides a single figure that captures the performance of the model across various conditions.\n\n5. **Intersection over Union (IoU)**: IoU measures the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box. It is a key metric for evaluating how accurately the model is able to localize objects.\n\n6. **Speed (Inference Time)**: Since YOLOS-tiny is designed to be a lightweight model, the speed of inference is an important metric. It measures how quickly the model can process an image and make predictions, which is crucial for real-time applications.\n\n7. **Model Size and Computational Complexity**: The number of parameters and the computational complexity of the model are important for deployment on devices with limited resources. A smaller model size and lower complexity may lead to faster inference times but could potentially reduce accuracy.\n\nWhen evaluating hustvl/yolos-tiny, it is important to consider the specific application and the tradeoffs that are acceptable for that context. For instance, in a real-time application where speed is critical, one might prioritize inference time over a slight drop in mAP. Conversely, in a scenario where accuracy is paramount, a higher mAP and IoU might be more important, even at the cost of increased inference time.

This can help to understand the model's behavior under different conditions and can highlight the features that are most important for the model's decisions.\n\n6. **Model Simplification**: Simplifying the model to a more interpretable form, such as by pruning less important connections or by distilling the model into a simpler one that approximates the original model's behavior, can also aid in explainability.\n\n7. **Documentation and Use Cases**: Providing comprehensive documentation that includes case studies or examples of how the model behaves in various scenarios can help users to better understand the model's strengths and limitations.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, developers aim to make `hustvl/yolos-tiny` more transparent and its decision-making process more accessible to users, which is crucial for applications where trust and understanding of AI systems are important."], "answer": ["As for the model design, YOLOS closely follows the original ViT architecture [21], and is optimized for object detection in the same vein as Carion et al.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "## Model Card for hustvl/yolos-tiny\n\n### Experimental Section: Explainability/Interpretability\n\nThe hustvl/yolos-tiny model is a compact version of the YOLOS (You Only Look One-level Series) model family, which is designed to adapt the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for object detection tasks. In this section, we delve into the explainability and interpretability aspects of the YOLOS-Tiny model.\n\n#### Attention Visualization\n\nTo understand how the model makes predictions, we have studied the self-attention mechanisms within the YOLOS-Tiny model. By visualizing the attention maps, we can observe that different self-attention heads focus on various patterns and locations across the input image. These visualizations can be both interpretable and non-interpretable, providing insights into the model's focus areas during detection.\n\nFor instance, we have compared the attention maps of two YOLOS models pre-trained on ImageNet-1k for different epochs but achieving the same average precision (AP). The visualizations suggest that even with the same AP, the models may attend to different features or regions for a given predicted object.\n\n#### Self-Attention of [DET] Tokens\n\nThe [DET] tokens, which are crucial for object detection in YOLOS models, have been specifically inspected for their self-attention patterns. By following the visualization pipeline from Caron et al., we have generated visual results that help us conclude the behavior of these tokens in the context of object detection.\n\n#### Correlation Study\n\nWe have conducted a study to measure the linear correlation between the proximity of [DET] tokens (in terms of cosine similarity) and their corresponding predictions' proximity (in terms of Euclidean distance). The result, with a correlation coefficient of \u03c1 X,Y = \u22120.80, indicates a strong inverse relationship, suggesting that [DET] tokens closer to each other tend to predict objects that are also nearby in the image.\n\n#### Model Design and Performance\n\nThe YOLOS-Tiny model is intentionally designed to be simple, closely following the original ViT architecture. This design choice is not aimed at optimizing detection performance but rather at revealing the characteristics and transferability of Transformer models in object detection tasks. Despite this, YOLOS-Tiny demonstrates impressive performance when compared to tiny-sized CNN detectors, being strong in AP and competitive in terms of FLOPs and FPS.\n\n#### Interpreting the Results\n\nThe results obtained from YOLOS-Tiny should be interpreted with the understanding that the model is not optimized for peak performance. Instead, it serves as a proof of concept for the application of ViT in object detection and as a starting point for model scaling within the Transformer family.\n\nIn summary, the YOLOS-Tiny model provides valuable insights into the application of Transformer architectures in computer vision, particularly in object detection. Its design allows for the study of explainability and interpretability within this domain, contributing to the broader understanding of how such models perceive and process visual information."}

It uses a bipartite matching loss for set prediction, following the approach by Carion et al., to perform object detection without manually injecting heuristics or prior knowledge of object spatial structure.\n\n7. **Performance**: Despite not being designed to optimize for detection performance, YOLOS-Ti achieves impressive performance compared to tiny-sized CNN detectors, being strong in average precision (AP) and competitive in FLOPs & FPS.\n\nIn summary, `hustvl/yolos-tiny` is a compact and efficient object detection model that leverages the strengths of the Vision Transformer architecture with a focus on simplicity and minimal inductive biases. It demonstrates the potential of Transformers in computer vision tasks, particularly object detection, without relying on complex and task-specific architectural modifications."}
