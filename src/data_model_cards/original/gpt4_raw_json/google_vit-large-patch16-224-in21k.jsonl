The \"large\" in its name indicates the size of the model, which is larger than the base or small versions, implying more parameters and potentially higher accuracy, but also increased computational requirements.\n\nHere are some basic details about the model architecture:\n\n1. **Vision Transformer (ViT) Structure**: The ViT model is a type of neural network that applies the transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, to image classification tasks. Instead of processing sequential data like sentences, it processes images.\n\n2. **Patch Size**: The `patch16` in the model name indicates that the input images are divided into patches of size 16x16 pixels. These patches are then flattened and linearly embedded before being fed into the transformer encoder.\n\n3. **Input Resolution**: The `224` in the model name specifies the resolution of the input images, which is 224x224 pixels. This is a common resolution for image classification tasks.\n\n4. **Pre-training Dataset**: The `in21k` denotes that the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which contains over 14 million images and 21,000 classes. This pre-training helps the model learn a wide variety of visual features before it is fine-tuned on a more specific dataset.\n\n5. **Model Size**: As a \"large\" model, ViT-Large typically has more layers and attention heads in its transformer encoder compared to the \"base\" or \"small\" versions. Specifically, the large variant often features a deeper network with more parameters, which allows it to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n\n6. **Attention Mechanism**: The core of the ViT architecture is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different patches of an image when making a classification decision. This is in contrast to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that process images through a series of convolutional filters.\n\n7. **Positional Embeddings**: Since the transformer does not have an inherent notion of the order of the input data, positional embeddings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information of the patches.\n\nThe Vision Transformer, including this large variant, has shown impressive performance on image classification tasks, often surpassing traditional CNNs, especially when pre-trained on large datasets and fine-tuned on specific tasks.", "The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` refers to a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that has been pre-trained by Google researchers on a large-scale dataset known as ImageNet-21k. The \"large\" in the model name indicates the size of the model, which is larger than the base version, and `patch16-224` specifies the input image resolution and the size of the patches the image is divided into. Here are some basic details about the training procedures typically involved in such a model:\n\n1. **Dataset**: The model is trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which contains approximately 21,000 classes with a diverse range of images. This extensive dataset allows the model to learn a wide variety of visual features.\n\n2. **Image Preprocessing**: Images are resized to a resolution of 224x224 pixels. Each image is then divided into patches; for this model, the patches are 16x16 pixels. These patches are treated as the equivalent of words in a sentence for a natural language processing model.\n\n3. **Model Architecture**: The ViT-large model consists of a larger number of transformer layers and attention heads compared to the base model. It has more parameters, which allows it to capture more complex patterns but also requires more computational resources to train.\n\n4. **Training Procedure**: The model is trained using supervised learning with a large batch size and a high learning rate, which is often decayed over time according to a pre-defined schedule. The training involves backpropagation and the use of an optimizer such as Adam or SGD with momentum.\n\n5. **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout, data augmentation, and weight decay are used to prevent overfitting, given the large capacity of the model.\n\n6. **Transfer Learning**: After pre-training on ImageNet-21k, the model can be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset (like ImageNet-1k with 1,000 classes) to adapt to more specific tasks or to improve performance on a narrower set of classes.\n\n7. **Evaluation**: Throughout the training process, the model's performance is periodically evaluated on a validation set to monitor its learning progress and to perform hyperparameter tuning.\n\n8. **Computational Resources**: Training such a large model requires significant computational resources, often involving multiple GPUs or TPUs, and can take several days or even weeks to complete.\n\nThe training procedures for models like `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` are complex and resource-intensive, but they result in powerful models capable of state-of-the-art performance on a variety of computer vision tasks.", "The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` is a variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which has been pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset.

Users should be aware of potential biases in the dataset and the model's limitations in generalizing to new tasks or data distributions.\n\n2. **Data Privacy**: When using the model, especially in applications that handle sensitive or personal data, it is crucial to ensure that privacy concerns are addressed, and that the use of the model complies with data protection laws and regulations.\n\n3. **Intellectual Property**: The model is provided by Google, and users should respect the terms of use, licensing agreements, and intellectual property rights associated with the model.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: Users should consider the ethical implications of deploying the model, particularly in contexts that may affect individuals or groups of people. This includes being mindful of potential biases in the model's predictions and the impact of its use on fairness and equity.\n\n5. **Model Interpretability**: As with many deep learning models, the Vision Transformer's decision-making process is not inherently interpretable. Users should be cautious about making critical decisions based solely on the model's output without understanding the underlying mechanisms.\n\n6. **Performance Expectations**: While the model may achieve high accuracy on certain benchmarks, performance can vary widely in real-world applications.

The \"large\" in its name indicates the size of the model, which is larger than the base or small versions, implying more parameters and potentially higher accuracy, but also increased computational requirements.\n\nHere are some basic details about the model architecture:\n\n1. **Vision Transformer (ViT) Structure**: The ViT model is a type of neural network that applies the transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, to image classification tasks. Instead of processing sequential data like sentences, it processes images.\n\n2. **Patch Size**: The `patch16` in the model name indicates that the input images are divided into patches of size 16x16 pixels. These patches are then flattened and linearly embedded before being fed into the transformer encoder.\n\n3. **Input Resolution**: The `224` in the model name specifies the resolution of the input images, which is 224x224 pixels. This is a common resolution for image classification tasks.\n\n4. **Pre-training Dataset**: The `in21k` denotes that the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which contains over 14 million images and 21,000 classes.

Specifically, the large variant often features a deeper network with more parameters, which allows it to capture more complex patterns in the data.\n\n6. **Attention Mechanism**: The core of the ViT architecture is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different patches of an image when making a classification decision. This is in contrast to traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that process images through a series of convolutional filters.\n\n7. **Positional Embeddings**: Since the transformer does not have an inherent notion of the order of the input data, positional embeddings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information of the patches.\n\nThe Vision Transformer, including this large variant, has shown impressive performance on image classification tasks, often surpassing traditional CNNs, especially when pre-trained on large datasets and fine-tuned on specific tasks.", "The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` refers to a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that has been pre-trained by Google researchers on a large-scale dataset known as ImageNet-21k.

Here are some basic details about the training procedures typically involved in such a model:\n\n1. **Dataset**: The model is trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which contains approximately 21,000 classes with a diverse range of images. This extensive dataset allows the model to learn a wide variety of visual features.\n\n2. **Image Preprocessing**: Images are resized to a resolution of 224x224 pixels. Each image is then divided into patches; for this model, the patches are 16x16 pixels. These patches are treated as the equivalent of words in a sentence for a natural language processing model.\n\n3. **Model Architecture**: The ViT-large model consists of a larger number of transformer layers and attention heads compared to the base model. It has more parameters, which allows it to capture more complex patterns but also requires more computational resources to train.\n\n4. **Training Procedure**: The model is trained using supervised learning with a large batch size and a high learning rate, which is often decayed over time according to a pre-defined schedule. The training involves backpropagation and the use of an optimizer such as Adam or SGD with momentum.\n\n5. **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout, data augmentation, and weight decay are used to prevent overfitting, given the large capacity of the model.\n\n6. **Transfer Learning**: After pre-training on ImageNet-21k, the model can be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset (like ImageNet-1k with 1,000 classes) to adapt to more specific tasks or to improve performance on a narrower set of classes.\n\n7. **Evaluation**: Throughout the training process, the model's performance is periodically evaluated on a validation set to monitor its learning progress and to perform hyperparameter tuning.\n\n8. **Computational Resources**: Training such a large model requires significant computational resources, often involving multiple GPUs or TPUs, and can take several days or even weeks to complete.\n\nThe training procedures for models like `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` are complex and resource-intensive, but they result in powerful models capable of state-of-the-art performance on a variety of computer vision tasks.", "The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` is a variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which has been pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset.

This includes being mindful of potential biases in the model's predictions and the impact of its use on fairness and equity.\n\n5. **Model Interpretability**: As with many deep learning models, the Vision Transformer's decision-making process is not inherently interpretable. Users should be cautious about making critical decisions based solely on the model's output without understanding the underlying mechanisms.\n\n6. **Performance Expectations**: While the model may achieve high accuracy on certain benchmarks, performance can vary widely in real-world applications.

We note that Vision Transformer has much less image-specific inductive bias than CNNs.

Inductive bias. We note that Vision Transformer has much less image-specific inductive bias than CNNs. In CNNs, locality, two-dimensional neighborhood structure, and translation equivariance are baked into each layer throughout the whole model. In ViT, only MLP layers are local and translationally equivariant, while the self-attention layers are global. The two-dimensional neighborhood structure is used very sparingly: in the beginning of the model by cutting the image into patches and at fine-tuning time\n2. Overview of the model: we split an image into fixed-size patches, linearly embed\neach of them, add position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of\nvectors to a standard Transformer encoder. In order to perform classification,\nwe use the standard approach of adding an extra learnable \"classification token\"\nto the sequence.\n3. Hybrid Architecture. As an alternative to raw image patches, the input sequence can be formed from feature maps of a CNN (LeCun et al., 1989). In this hybrid model, the patch embedding projection E (Eq. 1) is applied to patches extracted from a CNN feature map. As a special case, the patches can have spatial size 1x1, which means that the input sequence is obtained by simply flattening the spatial dimensions of the feature map and projecting to the Transformer dimension.\n4. An overview of the model is depicted in Figure 1. The standard Transformer receives as input a 1D sequence of token embeddings. To handle 2D images, we reshape the image x \u2208 R H\u00d7W \u00d7C into a sequence of flattened 2D patches x p \u2208 R N \u00d7(P 2 \u2022C) , where (H, W ) is the resolution of the original image, C is the number of channels, (P, P ) is the resolution of each image patch, and N = HW/P 2 is the resulting number of patches, which also serves as the effective input sequence length for the Transformer. The\n5. Similar to BERT's [class] token, we prepend a learnable embedding to the sequence of embedded patches (z 0 0 = x class ), whose state at the output of the Transformer encoder (z 0 L ) serves as the image representation y (Eq. 4). Both during pre-training and fine-tuning, a classification head is attached to z 0 L . The classification head is implemented by a MLP with one hidden layer at pre-training time and by a single linear layer at fine-tuning time.\n6. Typically, we pre-train ViT on large datasets, and fine-tune to (smaller) downstream tasks. For this, we remove the pre-trained prediction head and attach a zero-initialized D \u00d7 K feedforward layer, where K is the number of downstream classes. It is often beneficial to fine-tune at higher resolution than pre-training (Touvron et al., 2019;.

Model Variants. We base ViT configurations on those used for BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), as summarized in Table 1. The \"Base\" and \"Large\" models are directly adopted from BERT and we add the larger \"Huge\" model. In what follows we use brief notation to indicate the model size and the input patch size: for instance, ViT-L/16 means the \"Large\" variant with 16 \u00d7 16 input patch size.\n8. Inductive bias. We note that Vision Transformer has much less image-specific inductive bias than CNNs. In CNNs, locality, two-dimensional neighborhood structure, and translation equivariance are baked into each layer throughout the whole model. In ViT, only MLP layers are local and translationally equivariant, while the self-attention layers are global. The two-dimensional neighborhood structure is used very sparingly: in the beginning of the model by cutting the image into patches and at fine-tuning time\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nList the people or organizations that fund this project of the model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k.

Typically, we pre-train ViT on large datasets, and fine-tune to (smaller) downstream tasks. For this, we remove the pre-trained prediction head and attach a zero-initialized D \u00d7 K feedforward layer, where K is the number of downstream classes. It is often beneficial to fine-tune at higher resolution than pre-training (Touvron et al., 2019;. When feeding images of higher resolution, we keep the patch size the same, which results in a larger effective sequence length. The Vision Transformer can handle\n2. The \"How to train your ViT? ...\" paper added >50k checkpoints that you can\nfine-tune with the [`configs/augreg.py`] config. When you only specify the model\nname (the `config.name` value from [`configs/model.py`]), then the best i21k\ncheckpoint by upstream validation accuracy (\"recommended\" checkpoint, see\nsection 4.5 of the paper) is chosen. To make up your mind which model you want\nto use, have a look at Figure 3 in the paper. It's also possible to choose a\n3. You can run fine-tuning of the downloaded model on your dataset of interest. All\nmodels share the same command line interface.\n\nFor example for fine-tuning a ViT-B/16 (pre-trained on imagenet21k) on CIFAR10\n(note how we specify `b16,cifar10` as arguments to the config, and how we\ninstruct the code to access the models directly from a GCS bucket instead of\nfirst downloading them into the local directory):\n4. We fine-tune all ViT models using SGD with a momentum of 0.9. We run a small grid search over learning rates, see learning rate ranges in  for ResNets we also run the setup of  and select the best results across this run and our sweep. Finally, if not mentioned otherwise, all fine-tuning experiments run at 384 resolution (running fine-tuning at different resolution than training is common practice ).\n5. arbitrary sequence lengths (up to memory constraints), however, the pre-trained position embeddings may no longer be meaningful. We therefore perform 2D interpolation of the pre-trained position embeddings, according to their location in the original image. Note that this resolution adjustment and patch extraction are the only points at which an inductive bias about the 2D structure of the images is manually injected into the Vision Transformer.\n6. subsets and use the same hyper-parameters for all settings. This way, we assess the intrinsic model properties, and not the effect of regularization. We do, however, use early-stopping, and report the best validation accuracy achieved during training. To save compute, we report few-shot linear accuracy instead of full finetuning accuracy. Figure 4 contains the results. Vision Transformers overfit more than ResNets with comparable computational cost on smaller datasets. For example, ViT-B/32 is slightly\n7. Model Variants. We base ViT configurations on those used for BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), as summarized in Table 1. The \"Base\" and \"Large\" models are directly adopted from BERT and we add the larger \"Huge\" model.

This result is somewhat surprising, since one might expect convolutional local feature processing to assist ViT at any size.

Without fine-tuning, post-processing, or plugging into a pipeline, the model can be directly used to make predictions on images, assuming they are preprocessed to match the input requirements of the model (e.g., resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized).\n\nHere's a short passage explaining the usage followed by an example code snippet in Python using the Hugging Face Transformers library:\n\nThe `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model is a powerful image classification model that has been pre-trained on a vast array of images. It can be utilized directly for classifying images into one of the 21,000 categories it was trained on. To use the model without any additional fine-tuning or post-processing, you simply need to preprocess your input image to match the model's input specifications. This involves resizing the image to 224x224 pixels and normalizing it according to the pre-training conditions. Once the image is prepared, you can pass it through the model to obtain the predicted class probabilities. The output will be a vector of logits corresponding to the likelihood of each class.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use the model with the Hugging Face Transformers library:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, ViTForImageClassification\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\n# Load the feature extractor and model from Hugging Face\nfeature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k')\nmodel = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained('google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k')\n\n# Load an image from the web (or replace with your local image path)\nurl = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\n# Preprocess the image\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Make predictions\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\n\n# Retrieve the highest probability class\npredicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()\n\n# Print the predicted class index\nprint(\"Predicted class index:\", predicted_class_idx)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will output the index of the predicted class. To map this index to the actual class name, you would need access to the corresponding labels for the ImageNet-21k dataset, which is not included in the model itself.

Fine-tuning this model for a specific task involves a few steps to adapt the pre-trained model to the nuances of the new dataset and task. Here's a short passage explaining the fine-tuning process:\n\n---\n\nTo fine-tune the `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model for a specific image classification task, one must first prepare a dataset relevant to the task at hand. This dataset should be divided into training, validation, and test sets. The model, which has already learned general features from the extensive ImageNet-21k dataset, can now be adapted to recognize features more specific to the new dataset.\n\nThe fine-tuning process typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Load the pre-trained ViT model, ensuring that the input image size and patch size match the model's configuration (in this case, 224x224 pixels with 16x16 patches).\n\n2. **Modify Output Layer**: Adjust the model's output layer to match the number of classes in the new task. For instance, if the new task has 10 classes, the final classification layer should output 10 probabilities.\n\n3. **Hyperparameter Selection**: Choose appropriate hyperparameters for the fine-tuning process, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. A lower learning rate is often used to prevent overwriting the pre-trained weights too quickly.\n\n4. **Freezing Layers (Optional)**: In some cases, it may be beneficial to freeze the weights of certain layers, especially the earlier ones, as they capture universal image features that are likely useful for the new task. Only the later layers or the newly added output layer would be trained.\n\n5. **Training**: Train the model on the new dataset using the chosen hyperparameters. During this phase, the model will learn to adjust its weights to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual labels.\n\n6. **Validation**: Regularly evaluate the model on the validation set to monitor its performance and prevent overfitting. Early stopping or other regularization techniques may be employed based on validation set performance.\n\n7. **Testing**: Once the model has been fine-tuned and its performance on the validation set is satisfactory, the final step is to assess its generalization capability on the test set.\n\nBy following these steps, the `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model can be effectively fine-tuned to a new image classification task, leveraging its pre-trained knowledge to achieve higher accuracy than a model trained from scratch.\n\n--- \n\nThis passage outlines the general approach to fine-tuning a pre-trained Vision Transformer model for a new task, which can be applied to various image classification challenges.", "The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` is a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pre-trained on a large dataset (ImageNet-21k) and designed to process images by dividing them into fixed-size patches for classification tasks. To plug this model into a larger ecosystem or app, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Integration with Machine Learning Frameworks**: The model is compatible with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. You would first need to import the model using the appropriate libraries and dependencies in your application's backend.\n\n2. **Preprocessing**: Before feeding images to the model, they must be preprocessed to match the input size of 224x224 pixels and normalized according to the pre-training conditions. This step is crucial for the model to perform accurately.\n\n3. **API Development**: Develop a RESTful API or a gRPC service that allows client applications to send images to the server where the model is hosted. The server would then return the classification results after processing the images with the ViT model.\n\n4. **Microservices Architecture**: In a microservices architecture, the model can be deployed as an independent service that interacts with other services through well-defined interfaces. This allows for scalability and easier maintenance.\n\n5. **Application Integration**: Integrate the model into mobile apps, web applications, or desktop software by creating client-side functionality that captures or uploads images and communicates with the server-side model API to get predictions.\n\n6. **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the model, such as uploading images or viewing classification results.\n\n7. **Continuous Learning**: Optionally, implement a feedback loop where the model can be fine-tuned with new data collected from user interactions to improve its accuracy over time.\n\n8. **Security and Privacy**: Ensure that the application complies with data protection regulations and best practices, especially if dealing with sensitive or personal images.\n\n9. **Scalability and Performance**: Monitor the performance and scale the infrastructure as needed to handle the load, ensuring low latency and high availability of the model.\n\n10. **Compliance and Ethics**: Ensure that the use of the model adheres to ethical guidelines and is transparent to users, especially in terms of how their data is used and processed.\n\nBy following these steps, the `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model can be effectively integrated into a larger ecosystem or app, providing advanced image classification capabilities to a wide range of applications, from social media platforms to medical imaging software.", "Certainly!

Fine-tuning this model for a specific task involves a few steps to adapt the pre-trained model to the nuances of the new dataset and task. Here's a short passage explaining the fine-tuning process:\n\n---\n\nTo fine-tune the `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model for a specific image classification task, one must first prepare a dataset relevant to the task at hand. This dataset should be divided into training, validation, and test sets. The model, which has already learned general features from the extensive ImageNet-21k dataset, can now be adapted to recognize features more specific to the new dataset.\n\nThe fine-tuning process typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Load the pre-trained ViT model, ensuring that the input image size and patch size match the model's configuration (in this case, 224x224 pixels with 16x16 patches).\n\n2. **Modify Output Layer**: Adjust the model's output layer to match the number of classes in the new task. For instance, if the new task has 10 classes, the final classification layer should output 10 probabilities.\n\n3. **Hyperparameter Selection**: Choose appropriate hyperparameters for the fine-tuning process, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. A lower learning rate is often used to prevent overwriting the pre-trained weights too quickly.\n\n4. **Freezing Layers (Optional)**: In some cases, it may be beneficial to freeze the weights of certain layers, especially the earlier ones, as they capture universal image features that are likely useful for the new task. Only the later layers or the newly added output layer would be trained.\n\n5. **Training**: Train the model on the new dataset using the chosen hyperparameters. During this phase, the model will learn to adjust its weights to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual labels.\n\n6. **Validation**: Regularly evaluate the model on the validation set to monitor its performance and prevent overfitting.

The fine-tuning process involves replacing the pre-trained prediction head with a new feedforward layer that matches the number of classes in the downstream task. It is also common to fine-tune the model at a higher resolution than the pre-training to improve performance.\n\nWhen integrating this model into a larger ecosystem or application, it can serve as a powerful feature extractor for image-related tasks. For instance, it can be used in an app that requires image recognition, classification, or any other task where understanding the content of an image is crucial.\n\nTo fine-tune the `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model on a new dataset, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. Remove the pre-trained prediction head.\n2. Attach a new feedforward layer with the appropriate number of outputs for your specific task.\n3. Fine-tune the model on your dataset, potentially at a higher resolution than the pre-training.\n\nHere is a conceptual code snippet for fine-tuning the model, assuming you have a compatible training script and environment set up.

For actual implementation, you would need to refer to the documentation and examples provided by the libraries you are using, such as Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on fine-tuning and integrating the model into an application, you would need to consult the specific documentation and examples provided by the model's authors or the community.

While the Vision Transformer architecture has shown impressive results in image classification tasks, there are some known issues that can stem from this model and similar transformer-based models:\n\n1. **Computational Efficiency**: ViT models, especially larger ones like `vit-large`, can be computationally intensive due to their large number of parameters and the self-attention mechanism. This can lead to longer training and inference times compared to more traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n\n2. **Data Requirements**: Transformer models generally require a large amount of data to train effectively. While pre-training on ImageNet-21k helps, the model may still struggle to generalize well on smaller, less diverse, or more specialized datasets without further fine-tuning.\n\n3. **Overfitting**: Given its large capacity, the `vit-large` model can be prone to overfitting, especially when fine-tuned on smaller datasets. Regularization techniques and data augmentation are often necessary to mitigate this issue.\n\n4. **Interpretability**: Like many deep learning models, ViT models can be considered \"black boxes,\" making it difficult to interpret their decision-making process. This can be a significant issue in applications where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial.\n\n5. **Robustness and Bias**: ViT models can inherit biases present in the training data, leading to unfair or biased predictions. Additionally, they may not be robust to adversarial attacks or out-of-distribution data, which can be problematic in security-critical applications.\n\n6. **Resource Requirements**: The large size of the model means that it requires significant memory and processing power, which can be a barrier to deployment on resource-constrained devices or environments.\n\n7. **Patch Size Limitation**: The fixed patch size (`16x16` in the case of `vit-large-patch16-224`) can be a limitation for capturing fine-grained details in images, and the model may not perform as well on tasks that require understanding of small or highly detailed objects.\n\nIt's important to note that while these issues are known challenges, they do not necessarily prevent the model from being highly effective in many contexts. Researchers and practitioners often develop strategies to mitigate these issues, such as using model distillation, transfer learning, and robust fine-tuning practices.", "The model \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" is a variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT) designed for image classification tasks. While it has shown impressive performance, there are several foreseeable harms that could arise from its use:\n\n1. **Bias and Fairness**: Like any machine learning model, ViT can inherit and amplify biases present in the training data. If the \"in21k\" dataset (ImageNet-21k) contains biases related to race, gender, age, or other sensitive attributes, the model may produce unfair or discriminatory outcomes when deployed in real-world applications.\n\n2. **Privacy Concerns**: The model's ability to extract detailed information from images could lead to privacy violations if used to analyze personal photographs without consent. This is particularly concerning if the model is applied to surveillance or data mining tasks.\n\n3. **Misuse**: The high performance of the model could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as creating deepfakes, conducting unauthorized surveillance, or automating the analysis of imagery for nefarious activities.\n\n4. **Environmental Impact**: Training and deploying large models like ViT require significant computational resources, which can lead to a substantial carbon footprint. The environmental impact of using such models at scale is a growing concern in the AI community.\n\n5. **Economic Displacement**: Automation of tasks that previously required human visual understanding could lead to job displacement. While this can increase efficiency, it also raises concerns about the economic impact on individuals whose livelihoods are affected.\n\n6. **Dependence on Technology**: Over-reliance on automated systems can lead to a degradation of human skills and judgment. In critical applications, such as medical diagnosis or autonomous driving, an over-dependence on AI could have serious consequences if the technology fails or is manipulated.\n\n7. **Security Risks**: If the model is integrated into security-critical systems, there is a risk that adversarial attacks could exploit weaknesses in the model to bypass or deceive such systems.\n\n8. **Opaque Decision-Making**: The complexity of transformer models can make it difficult to interpret their decisions. This lack of transparency can be problematic in applications where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial, such as in healthcare or criminal justice.\n\nMitigating these harms requires careful consideration of ethical guidelines, robustness checks, bias mitigation strategies, and transparency measures. It also involves engaging with stakeholders and affected communities to understand the broader implications of deploying such technology.", "The model \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" refers to a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that has been pre-trained on a large dataset known as ImageNet-21k. This model is designed to process images by dividing them into patches and then analyzing them using self-attention mechanisms similar to those used in natural language processing. Despite its effectiveness, there are several common misunderstandings related to this model:\n\n1. **It's not a convolutional neural network (CNN):** People often assume that all state-of-the-art image processing models are CNNs. However, the Vision Transformer is different as it relies on transformer mechanisms rather than convolutional layers.\n\n2. **Patch size is fixed:** The name \"patch16\" indicates that the image is divided into patches of size 16x16 pixels. This is a fixed architectural decision and not something that can be easily changed without retraining the model.\n\n3. **Pre-training dataset size:** The \"in21k\" part of the name signifies that the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which is much larger than the commonly used ImageNet-1k. This can lead to confusion about the model's capabilities and the kind of data it has been exposed to.\n\n4. **Transfer learning capabilities:** Some may misunderstand the model's ability to transfer to other tasks. While it has been pre-trained on a large dataset, fine-tuning is often necessary to achieve high performance on specific tasks or smaller datasets.\n\n5. **Computational requirements:** Due to its large size and the nature of transformers, the model can be computationally intensive to train and infer, which might be underestimated by those not familiar with the architecture.\n\n6. **Understanding self-attention:** The concept of self-attention can be difficult to grasp, leading to misconceptions about how the model processes image data and the kind of features it can capture.\n\n7. **Generalization versus specialization:** Some might expect that pre-training on a large dataset like ImageNet-21k automatically means the model will generalize well to any visual task, which is not always the case. Fine-tuning and task-specific adaptations are often necessary.\n\nUnderstanding these nuances is crucial for effectively utilizing the \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" model and for setting realistic expectations about its performance and application scope.", "The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` is a Vision Transformer (ViT) designed for image classification tasks. Despite its impressive performance on various benchmarks, it has certain technical limitations:\n\n1. **Computational Resources**: ViT models, including this one, are generally more computationally intensive than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They require significant GPU or TPU resources for both training and inference, which can be a limiting factor for those without access to high-end hardware.\n\n2. **Data Efficiency**: While the `in21k` variant of the model has been pre-trained on a large dataset (ImageNet-21k), Vision Transformers typically require more data to achieve comparable performance to CNNs. This can be a limitation when dealing with tasks where data is scarce or expensive to collect.\n\n3. **Inference Speed**: Due to the self-attention mechanism used in Transformers, the inference speed can be slower compared to more lightweight CNNs. This can be a limitation for applications that require real-time processing or have strict latency requirements.\n\n4. **Fixed Input Size**: The model is designed to work with images of size 224x224 pixels. While it can handle different sizes, doing so requires either resizing the input images, which can lead to loss of information, or modifying the model architecture, which requires additional work and expertise.\n\n5. **Generalization to Out-of-Distribution Data**: Like many deep learning models, ViTs may struggle to generalize to data that is significantly different from the training distribution. This can be a limitation when deploying the model in real-world scenarios where the input data may not closely match the characteristics of the training dataset.\n\n6. **Interpretability**: Vision Transformers are complex models, and their decision-making process is not as interpretable as some simpler models. This can be a limitation in domains where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial, such as in medical imaging or autonomous driving.\n\n7. **Adaptation to New Tasks**: While the model is pre-trained on a large dataset, fine-tuning it for specific tasks can still be challenging. It requires a good understanding of transfer learning techniques and careful tuning of hyperparameters to avoid overfitting or underfitting.\n\n8. **Memory Consumption**: The self-attention mechanism in Transformers requires storing the attention scores for each pair of input tokens, which leads to high memory consumption. This can be a limitation when working with very large images or when trying to scale up the model size.\n\nThese limitations should be considered when choosing to implement the `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model for a specific application or research project.", "The model \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" is a Vision Transformer (ViT) designed for image classification tasks. While it represents a significant advancement in computer vision technology, it is not without its sociotechnical limitations. These limitations are often a result of the interplay between the technology and the social context in which it is deployed.\n\n1. **Data Bias and Fairness**: The model is trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which, despite its size and diversity, may contain biases. These biases can be in the form of underrepresentation of certain demographics, cultural insensitivities, or skewed portrayals of objects and scenes. When the model is applied in real-world settings, these biases can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, particularly affecting marginalized groups.\n\n2. **Transparency and Explainability**: Vision Transformers are complex models with millions of parameters. This complexity can make it difficult to understand how the model is making its decisions, which is a challenge for transparency and explainability. In critical applications where understanding the decision-making process is essential, such as in healthcare or law enforcement, this lack of transparency can be a significant limitation.\n\n3. **Resource Intensity**: The \"large\" variant of the Vision Transformer is computationally intensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. This can limit its accessibility to organizations with less computational power and can also have environmental implications due to the energy consumption and carbon footprint associated with running large-scale models.\n\n4. **Generalization and Robustness**: While the model is trained on a large dataset, it may not generalize well to all types of images or environments, particularly those that are significantly different from the data it was trained on. This can limit its effectiveness in diverse real-world applications where the conditions or contexts vary greatly.\n\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: The deployment of powerful image recognition models can raise privacy concerns, especially when used in surveillance or data analysis without the consent of the individuals whose images are being processed. Ensuring that the use of such models complies with privacy regulations and ethical standards is a significant challenge.\n\n6. **Regulatory and Ethical Oversight**: As AI models become more integrated into societal functions, the need for regulatory and ethical oversight increases. Ensuring that the model is used responsibly and does not perpetuate harm or inequality requires careful consideration and potentially new frameworks for governance.\n\n7. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: The benefits of advanced AI models like ViT should be accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. However, the design and outputs of such models may not always be inclusive, potentially excluding certain user groups from fully benefiting from the technology.\n\nAddressing these sociotechnical limitations requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaboration between technologists, ethicists, policymakers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the model is used in a way that maximizes benefits while minimizing potential harms to society."]}

{"question": "bias_risks_limitations", "chain": "retrieval", "prompt": ["The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` is a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pre-trained on a large dataset of images (ImageNet-21k). While the Vision Transformer architecture has shown impressive results in image classification tasks, there are some known issues that can stem from this model and similar transformer-based models:\n\n1. **Computational Efficiency**: ViT models, especially larger ones like `vit-large`, can be computationally intensive due to their large number of parameters and the self-attention mechanism. This can lead to longer training and inference times compared to more traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\n\n2. **Data Requirements**: Transformer models generally require a large amount of data to train effectively. While pre-training on ImageNet-21k helps, the model may still struggle to generalize well on smaller, less diverse, or more specialized datasets without further fine-tuning.\n\n3. **Overfitting**: Given its large capacity, the `vit-large` model can be prone to overfitting, especially when fine-tuned on smaller datasets. Regularization techniques and data augmentation are often necessary to mitigate this issue.\n\n4. **Interpretability**: Like many deep learning models, ViT models can be considered \"black boxes,\" making it difficult to interpret their decision-making process. This can be a significant issue in applications where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial.\n\n5. **Robustness and Bias**: ViT models can inherit biases present in the training data, leading to unfair or biased predictions. Additionally, they may not be robust to adversarial attacks or out-of-distribution data, which can be problematic in security-critical applications.\n\n6. **Resource Requirements**: The large size of the model means that it requires significant memory and processing power, which can be a barrier to deployment on resource-constrained devices or environments.\n\n7. **Patch Size Limitation**: The fixed patch size (`16x16` in the case of `vit-large-patch16-224`) can be a limitation for capturing fine-grained details in images, and the model may not perform as well on tasks that require understanding of small or highly detailed objects.\n\nIt's important to note that while these issues are known challenges, they do not necessarily prevent the model from being highly effective in many contexts. Researchers and practitioners often develop strategies to mitigate these issues, such as using model distillation, transfer learning, and robust fine-tuning practices.", "The model \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" is a variant of the Vision Transformer (ViT) designed for image classification tasks. While it has shown impressive performance, there are several foreseeable harms that could arise from its use:\n\n1. **Bias and Fairness**: Like any machine learning model, ViT can inherit and amplify biases present in the training data. If the \"in21k\" dataset (ImageNet-21k) contains biases related to race, gender, age, or other sensitive attributes, the model may produce unfair or discriminatory outcomes when deployed in real-world applications.\n\n2. **Privacy Concerns**: The model's ability to extract detailed information from images could lead to privacy violations if used to analyze personal photographs without consent. This is particularly concerning if the model is applied to surveillance or data mining tasks.\n\n3. **Misuse**: The high performance of the model could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as creating deepfakes, conducting unauthorized surveillance, or automating the analysis of imagery for nefarious activities.\n\n4. **Environmental Impact**: Training and deploying large models like ViT require significant computational resources, which can lead to a substantial carbon footprint. The environmental impact of using such models at scale is a growing concern in the AI community.\n\n5. **Economic Displacement**: Automation of tasks that previously required human visual understanding could lead to job displacement. While this can increase efficiency, it also raises concerns about the economic impact on individuals whose livelihoods are affected.\n\n6. **Dependence on Technology**: Over-reliance on automated systems can lead to a degradation of human skills and judgment. In critical applications, such as medical diagnosis or autonomous driving, an over-dependence on AI could have serious consequences if the technology fails or is manipulated.\n\n7. **Security Risks**: If the model is integrated into security-critical systems, there is a risk that adversarial attacks could exploit weaknesses in the model to bypass or deceive such systems.\n\n8. **Opaque Decision-Making**: The complexity of transformer models can make it difficult to interpret their decisions. This lack of transparency can be problematic in applications where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial, such as in healthcare or criminal justice.\n\nMitigating these harms requires careful consideration of ethical guidelines, robustness checks, bias mitigation strategies, and transparency measures. It also involves engaging with stakeholders and affected communities to understand the broader implications of deploying such technology.", "The model \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" refers to a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that has been pre-trained on a large dataset known as ImageNet-21k. This model is designed to process images by dividing them into patches and then analyzing them using self-attention mechanisms similar to those used in natural language processing. Despite its effectiveness, there are several common misunderstandings related to this model:\n\n1. **It's not a convolutional neural network (CNN):** People often assume that all state-of-the-art image processing models are CNNs. However, the Vision Transformer is different as it relies on transformer mechanisms rather than convolutional layers.\n\n2. **Patch size is fixed:** The name \"patch16\" indicates that the image is divided into patches of size 16x16 pixels. This is a fixed architectural decision and not something that can be easily changed without retraining the model.\n\n3. **Pre-training dataset size:** The \"in21k\" part of the name signifies that the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which is much larger than the commonly used ImageNet-1k. This can lead to confusion about the model's capabilities and the kind of data it has been exposed to.\n\n4. **Transfer learning capabilities:** Some may misunderstand the model's ability to transfer to other tasks. While it has been pre-trained on a large dataset, fine-tuning is often necessary to achieve high performance on specific tasks or smaller datasets.\n\n5. **Computational requirements:** Due to its large size and the nature of transformers, the model can be computationally intensive to train and infer, which might be underestimated by those not familiar with the architecture.\n\n6. **Understanding self-attention:** The concept of self-attention can be difficult to grasp, leading to misconceptions about how the model processes image data and the kind of features it can capture.\n\n7. **Generalization versus specialization:** Some might expect that pre-training on a large dataset like ImageNet-21k automatically means the model will generalize well to any visual task, which is not always the case. Fine-tuning and task-specific adaptations are often necessary.\n\nUnderstanding these nuances is crucial for effectively utilizing the \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" model and for setting realistic expectations about its performance and application scope.", "The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` is a Vision Transformer (ViT) designed for image classification tasks. Despite its impressive performance on various benchmarks, it has certain technical limitations:\n\n1. **Computational Resources**: ViT models, including this one, are generally more computationally intensive than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They require significant GPU or TPU resources for both training and inference, which can be a limiting factor for those without access to high-end hardware.\n\n2. **Data Efficiency**: While the `in21k` variant of the model has been pre-trained on a large dataset (ImageNet-21k), Vision Transformers typically require more data to achieve comparable performance to CNNs. This can be a limitation when dealing with tasks where data is scarce or expensive to collect.\n\n3. **Inference Speed**: Due to the self-attention mechanism used in Transformers, the inference speed can be slower compared to more lightweight CNNs. This can be a limitation for applications that require real-time processing or have strict latency requirements.\n\n4. **Fixed Input Size**: The model is designed to work with images of size 224x224 pixels. While it can handle different sizes, doing so requires either resizing the input images, which can lead to loss of information, or modifying the model architecture, which requires additional work and expertise.\n\n5. **Generalization to Out-of-Distribution Data**: Like many deep learning models, ViTs may struggle to generalize to data that is significantly different from the training distribution. This can be a limitation when deploying the model in real-world scenarios where the input data may not closely match the characteristics of the training dataset.\n\n6. **Interpretability**: Vision Transformers are complex models, and their decision-making process is not as interpretable as some simpler models. This can be a limitation in domains where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial, such as in medical imaging or autonomous driving.\n\n7. **Adaptation to New Tasks**: While the model is pre-trained on a large dataset, fine-tuning it for specific tasks can still be challenging. It requires a good understanding of transfer learning techniques and careful tuning of hyperparameters to avoid overfitting or underfitting.\n\n8. **Memory Consumption**: The self-attention mechanism in Transformers requires storing the attention scores for each pair of input tokens, which leads to high memory consumption. This can be a limitation when working with very large images or when trying to scale up the model size.\n\nThese limitations should be considered when choosing to implement the `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model for a specific application or research project.", "The model \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" is a Vision Transformer (ViT) designed for image classification tasks. While it represents a significant advancement in computer vision technology, it is not without its sociotechnical limitations. These limitations are often a result of the interplay between the technology and the social context in which it is deployed.\n\n1. **Data Bias and Fairness**: The model is trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which, despite its size and diversity, may contain biases. These biases can be in the form of underrepresentation of certain demographics, cultural insensitivities, or skewed portrayals of objects and scenes. When the model is applied in real-world settings, these biases can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, particularly affecting marginalized groups.\n\n2. **Transparency and Explainability**: Vision Transformers are complex models with millions of parameters. This complexity can make it difficult to understand how the model is making its decisions, which is a challenge for transparency and explainability. In critical applications where understanding the decision-making process is essential, such as in healthcare or law enforcement, this lack of transparency can be a significant limitation.\n\n3. **Resource Intensity**: The \"large\" variant of the Vision Transformer is computationally intensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. This can limit its accessibility to organizations with less computational power and can also have environmental implications due to the energy consumption and carbon footprint associated with running large-scale models.\n\n4. **Generalization and Robustness**: While the model is trained on a large dataset, it may not generalize well to all types of images or environments, particularly those that are significantly different from the data it was trained on. This can limit its effectiveness in diverse real-world applications where the conditions or contexts vary greatly.\n\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: The deployment of powerful image recognition models can raise privacy concerns, especially when used in surveillance or data analysis without the consent of the individuals whose images are being processed. Ensuring that the use of such models complies with privacy regulations and ethical standards is a significant challenge.\n\n6. **Regulatory and Ethical Oversight**: As AI models become more integrated into societal functions, the need for regulatory and ethical oversight increases. Ensuring that the model is used responsibly and does not perpetuate harm or inequality requires careful consideration and potentially new frameworks for governance.\n\n7. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: The benefits of advanced AI models like ViT should be accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. However, the design and outputs of such models may not always be inclusive, potentially excluding certain user groups from fully benefiting from the technology.\n\nAddressing these sociotechnical limitations requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaboration between technologists, ethicists, policymakers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the model is used in a way that maximizes benefits while minimizing potential harms to society."], "answer": ["Another quantity of interest is the largest batch-size each model can fit onto a core, larger being better for scaling to large datasets.

One is to apply ViT to other computer vision tasks, such as detection and segmentation. Our results, coupled with those in Carion et al. (2020), indicate the promise of this approach. Another challenge is to continue exploring selfsupervised pre-training methods. Our initial experiments show improvement from self-supervised pre-training, but there is still large gap between self-supervised and large-scale supervised pretraining. Finally,", "further scaling of ViT would likely lead to improved performance.   Vaswani et al. (2017)) is a popular building block for neural architectures. For each element in an input sequence z \u2208 R N \u00d7D , we compute a weighted sum over all values v in the sequence. The attention weights A ij are based on the pairwise similarity between two elements of the sequence and their respective query q i and key k j representations.", "We have explored the direct application of Transformers to image recognition. Unlike prior works using self-attention in computer vision, we do not introduce image-specific inductive biases into the architecture apart from the initial patch extraction step. Instead, we interpret an image as a sequence of patches and process it by a standard Transformer encoder as used in NLP. This simple, yet scalable, strategy works surprisingly well when coupled with pre-training on large datasets. Thus, Vision", "[`vit_jax/configs/models.py`]: https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/main/vit_jax/configs/models.py\n[`model_cards/lit.md`]: https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer/blob/main/model_cards/lit.md", "Transformer matches or exceeds the state of the art on many image classification datasets, whilst being relatively cheap to pre-train.", "Figure 13, present the performance of Axial ResNet, Axial-ViT-B/32 and Axial-ViT-B/16 on Ima-geNet 5shot linear, when pretrained on JFT dataset, verses the pretraining compute, both in terms of number of FLOPs and inference time (example per seconds). As we can see, both Axial-ViT-B/32 and Axial-ViT-B/16 do better than their ViT-B counterpart in terms of performance, but it comes at the cost of more compute. This is because in Axial-ViT models, each Transformer block with global self-attention is replaced", "vanishes for larger models. This result is somewhat surprising, since one might expect convolutional local feature processing to assist ViT at any size. Third, Vision Transformers appear not to saturate within the range tried, motivating future scaling efforts. To begin to understand how the Vision Transformer processes image data, we analyze its internal representations. The first layer of the Vision Transformer linearly projects the flattened patches into a lower-dimensional space (Eq. 1). Figure 7", "Figure 5 contains the transfer performance versus total pre-training compute (see Appendix D.5 for details on computational costs). Detailed results per model are provided in Table 6 in the Appendix. A few patterns can be observed. First, Vision Transformers dominate ResNets on the performance/compute trade-off.

This model is designed to process images by dividing them into patches and then analyzing them using self-attention mechanisms similar to those used in natural language processing. Despite its effectiveness, there are several common misunderstandings related to this model:\n\n1. **It's not a convolutional neural network (CNN):** People often assume that all state-of-the-art image processing models are CNNs. However, the Vision Transformer is different as it relies on transformer mechanisms rather than convolutional layers.\n\n2. **Patch size is fixed:** The name \"patch16\" indicates that the image is divided into patches of size 16x16 pixels. This is a fixed architectural decision and not something that can be easily changed without retraining the model.\n\n3. **Pre-training dataset size:** The \"in21k\" part of the name signifies that the model was pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which is much larger than the commonly used ImageNet-1k. This can lead to confusion about the model's capabilities and the kind of data it has been exposed to.\n\n4. **Transfer learning capabilities:** Some may misunderstand the model's ability to transfer to other tasks. While it has been pre-trained on a large dataset, fine-tuning is often necessary to achieve high performance on specific tasks or smaller datasets.\n\n5. **Computational requirements:** Due to its large size and the nature of transformers, the model can be computationally intensive to train and infer, which might be underestimated by those not familiar with the architecture.\n\n6. **Understanding self-attention:** The concept of self-attention can be difficult to grasp, leading to misconceptions about how the model processes image data and the kind of features it can capture.\n\n7. **Generalization versus specialization:** Some might expect that pre-training on a large dataset like ImageNet-21k automatically means the model will generalize well to any visual task, which is not always the case. Fine-tuning and task-specific adaptations are often necessary.\n\nUnderstanding these nuances is crucial for effectively utilizing the \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" model and for setting realistic expectations about its performance and application scope.", "The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` is a Vision Transformer (ViT) designed for image classification tasks. Despite its impressive performance on various benchmarks, it has certain technical limitations:\n\n1. **Computational Resources**: ViT models, including this one, are generally more computationally intensive than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They require significant GPU or TPU resources for both training and inference, which can be a limiting factor for those without access to high-end hardware.\n\n2. **Data Efficiency**: While the `in21k` variant of the model has been pre-trained on a large dataset (ImageNet-21k), Vision Transformers typically require more data to achieve comparable performance to CNNs. This can be a limitation when dealing with tasks where data is scarce or expensive to collect.\n\n3. **Inference Speed**: Due to the self-attention mechanism used in Transformers, the inference speed can be slower compared to more lightweight CNNs. This can be a limitation for applications that require real-time processing or have strict latency requirements.\n\n4. **Fixed Input Size**: The model is designed to work with images of size 224x224 pixels. While it can handle different sizes, doing so requires either resizing the input images, which can lead to loss of information, or modifying the model architecture, which requires additional work and expertise.\n\n5. **Generalization to Out-of-Distribution Data**: Like many deep learning models, ViTs may struggle to generalize to data that is significantly different from the training distribution. This can be a limitation when deploying the model in real-world scenarios where the input data may not closely match the characteristics of the training dataset.\n\n6. **Interpretability**: Vision Transformers are complex models, and their decision-making process is not as interpretable as some simpler models. This can be a limitation in domains where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial, such as in medical imaging or autonomous driving.\n\n7. **Adaptation to New Tasks**: While the model is pre-trained on a large dataset, fine-tuning it for specific tasks can still be challenging. It requires a good understanding of transfer learning techniques and careful tuning of hyperparameters to avoid overfitting or underfitting.\n\n8. **Memory Consumption**: The self-attention mechanism in Transformers requires storing the attention scores for each pair of input tokens, which leads to high memory consumption. This can be a limitation when working with very large images or when trying to scale up the model size.\n\nThese limitations should be considered when choosing to implement the `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model for a specific application or research project.", "The model \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" is a Vision Transformer (ViT) designed for image classification tasks. While it represents a significant advancement in computer vision technology, it is not without its sociotechnical limitations. These limitations are often a result of the interplay between the technology and the social context in which it is deployed.\n\n1. **Data Bias and Fairness**: The model is trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which, despite its size and diversity, may contain biases. These biases can be in the form of underrepresentation of certain demographics, cultural insensitivities, or skewed portrayals of objects and scenes. When the model is applied in real-world settings, these biases can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, particularly affecting marginalized groups.\n\n2. **Transparency and Explainability**: Vision Transformers are complex models with millions of parameters. This complexity can make it difficult to understand how the model is making its decisions, which is a challenge for transparency and explainability. In critical applications where understanding the decision-making process is essential, such as in healthcare or law enforcement, this lack of transparency can be a significant limitation.\n\n3. **Resource Intensity**: The \"large\" variant of the Vision Transformer is computationally intensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. This can limit its accessibility to organizations with less computational power and can also have environmental implications due to the energy consumption and carbon footprint associated with running large-scale models.\n\n4. **Generalization and Robustness**: While the model is trained on a large dataset, it may not generalize well to all types of images or environments, particularly those that are significantly different from the data it was trained on. This can limit its effectiveness in diverse real-world applications where the conditions or contexts vary greatly.\n\n5. **Privacy Concerns**: The deployment of powerful image recognition models can raise privacy concerns, especially when used in surveillance or data analysis without the consent of the individuals whose images are being processed. Ensuring that the use of such models complies with privacy regulations and ethical standards is a significant challenge.\n\n6. **Regulatory and Ethical Oversight**: As AI models become more integrated into societal functions, the need for regulatory and ethical oversight increases. Ensuring that the model is used responsibly and does not perpetuate harm or inequality requires careful consideration and potentially new frameworks for governance.\n\n7. **Accessibility and Inclusivity**: The benefits of advanced AI models like ViT should be accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. However, the design and outputs of such models may not always be inclusive, potentially excluding certain user groups from fully benefiting from the technology.\n\nAddressing these sociotechnical limitations requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaboration between technologists, ethicists, policymakers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the model is used in a way that maximizes benefits while minimizing potential harms to society."], "answer": ["subsets and use the same hyper-parameters for all settings.

This result is somewhat surprising, since one might expect convolutional local feature processing to assist ViT at any size. Third, Vision Transformers appear not to saturate within the range tried, motivating future scaling efforts. To begin to understand how the Vision Transformer processes image data, we analyze its internal representations. The first layer of the Vision Transformer linearly projects the flattened patches into a lower-dimensional space (Eq. 1). Figure 7", "Datasets. To explore model scalability, we use the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset with 1k classes and 1.3M images (we refer to it as ImageNet in what follows), its superset ImageNet-21k with 21k classes and 14M images (Deng et al., 2009), and JFT (Sun et al., 2017) with 18k classes and 303M high-resolution images.

We note that Vision Transformer has much less image-specific inductive bias than CNNs. In CNNs, locality, two-dimensional neighborhood structure, and translation equivariance are baked into each layer throughout the whole model. In ViT, only MLP layers are local and translationally equivariant, while the self-attention layers are global. The two-dimensional neighborhood structure is used very sparingly: in the beginning of the model by cutting the image into patches and at fine-tuning time", "We evaluate the representation learning capabilities of ResNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), and the hybrid. To understand the data requirements of each model, we pre-train on datasets of varying size and evaluate many benchmark tasks. When considering the computational cost of pre-training the model, ViT performs very favourably, attaining state of the art on most recognition benchmarks at a lower pre-training cost.

{"question": "bias_recommendations", "chain": "rev_retrieval", "prompt": ["The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` is a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pre-trained on a large-scale dataset (ImageNet-21k) and designed to process images with a resolution of 224x224 pixels, using patches of size 16x16. While this model represents a significant advancement in computer vision, there are several foreseeable issues that users and developers should consider:\n\n1. **Computational Resources**: ViT models are known for their high computational demands, especially during training. Users should ensure they have access to appropriate hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, to fine-tune or infer with this model efficiently.\n\n2. **Data Efficiency**: Vision Transformers may not be as data-efficient as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when trained from scratch. This model, however, mitigates this issue by pre-training on a large dataset. Still, fine-tuning on a small dataset might require careful regularization to avoid overfitting.\n\n3. **Generalization to New Domains**: While pre-training on ImageNet-21k provides a broad knowledge base, the model might not generalize well to very different domains or tasks without significant fine-tuning and data augmentation.\n\n4. **Interpretability**: Transformers are less interpretable than some other architectures. Understanding why the model makes certain decisions can be challenging, which might be problematic in sensitive applications.\n\n5. **Patch Size Limitation**: The fixed patch size of 16x16 may not be optimal for all types of images or tasks. For instance, images with fine details might require smaller patches, while larger patches might be more suitable for images with large, coherent structures.\n\n6. **Adaptation to Higher Resolution**: The model is designed for 224x224 resolution images. Adapting it to higher-resolution images would require architectural changes or pre-processing steps, which could affect performance.\n\n7. **Bias and Fairness**: As with any machine learning model, there is a risk of bias in the predictions, which can stem from biases present in the training data. It is crucial to evaluate the model for fairness and bias, especially if it is to be used in diverse real-world scenarios.\n\n8. **Robustness and Adversarial Attacks**: ViT models may be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Users should be aware of this vulnerability and consider implementing robustness measures or using adversarial training techniques.\n\n9. **Environmental Impact**: The high computational cost of training and fine-tuning large models like ViTs also translates into a significant carbon footprint. Users should consider the environmental impact and explore ways to mitigate it, such as using more efficient hardware or optimizing the model's architecture.\n\n10. **Licensing and Ethical Use**: Finally, users should be aware of the licensing terms associated with the model and the dataset it was trained on. They should ensure that their use of the model complies with these terms and consider the ethical implications of deploying the model in real-world applications.\n\nBy addressing these issues, users can better prepare for the successful deployment of the `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model in their specific use cases."], "answer": ["Datasets.

Since each patch is 16x16 pixels and each pixel has three color channels (RGB), the length of the vector for each patch is 16 * 16 * 3 = 768.\n\n4. **Linear Projection**: The flattened patch vectors are then projected into a higher-dimensional space using a trainable linear projection (a matrix multiplication followed by a bias addition). This is akin to embedding tokens in NLP models. The dimensionality of the projection is determined by the size of the transformer's hidden layers.\n\n5. **Positional Encoding**: Since the transformer architecture does not inherently account for the order of the input data, positional encodings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information. These encodings can be learned or fixed and are added to the patch embeddings before they are fed into the transformer encoder.\n\n6. **Class Token**: Additionally, a special 'class token' is prepended to the sequence of embedded patches. This token is used to aggregate information across the patches and is ultimately used for classification after passing through the transformer layers.\n\n7. **Transformer Encoder**: The sequence of patch embeddings, now with positional encodings and the class token, is passed through the transformer encoder layers. The encoder consists of alternating layers of multi-headed self-attention and MLP blocks, with normalization and residual connections.\n\nThe output of the transformer encoder is then used for the classification task, with the representation corresponding to the class token serving as the input to the final classifier layer.\n\nIt's important to note that the tokenization process in Vision Transformers is quite different from the tokenization in NLP models, as it deals with raw pixel data rather than discrete tokens like words or subwords.", "The model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` refers to a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that has been pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset. The \"large\" indicates the size of the model, which has more layers and parameters compared to its \"base\" or \"small\" counterparts. The \"patch16\" means that the input images are divided into patches of 16x16 pixels, and \"224\" refers to the resolution of the input images, which is 224x224 pixels.\n\nWhen preparing data for this model, the resizing process is crucial to ensure that the input images match the expected input resolution of the model. Here's a brief overview of the resizing process:\n\n1. **Image Resizing**: All input images are resized to the required input resolution of 224x224 pixels. This is typically done using interpolation methods such as bilinear, bicubic, or nearest-neighbor interpolation to maintain the quality of the image as much as possible during the resizing.\n\n2. **Patch Extraction**: Once the images are resized, they are divided into non-overlapping patches. For the `vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model, this means dividing the image into 14x14 (196 in total) patches, each of which is 16x16 pixels in size. This is because the 224x224 image does not evenly divide into 16x16 patches, so the image is effectively padded slightly to fit.\n\n3. **Flattening and Linear Projection**: Each patch is then flattened into a 1D vector and passed through a linear projection layer to transform it into a higher-dimensional space. This is akin to creating \"words\" in a sentence for a language model, but in this case, the \"words\" are the flattened patches of the image.\n\n4. **Positional Encoding**: Since the transformer architecture does not inherently account for the order of the input data, positional encodings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information.

The classification head is implemented by a MLP with one hidden layer at pre-training time and by a single linear layer at fine-tuning time.\n3. Hybrid Architecture. As an alternative to raw image patches, the input sequence can be formed from feature maps of a CNN (LeCun et al., 1989). In this hybrid model, the patch embedding projection E (Eq. 1) is applied to patches extracted from a CNN feature map. As a special case, the patches can have spatial size 1x1, which means that the input sequence is obtained by simply flattening the spatial dimensions of the feature map and projecting to the Transformer dimension.\n4. Transformer uses constant latent vector size D through all of its layers, so we flatten the patches and map to D dimensions with a trainable linear projection (Eq. 1). We refer to the output of this projection as the patch embeddings.\n5. Inductive bias. We note that Vision Transformer has much less image-specific inductive bias than CNNs. In CNNs, locality, two-dimensional neighborhood structure, and translation equivariance are baked into each layer throughout the whole model. In ViT, only MLP layers are local and translationally equivariant, while the self-attention layers are global. The two-dimensional neighborhood structure is used very sparingly: in the beginning of the model by cutting the image into patches and at fine-tuning time\n6. Typically, we pre-train ViT on large datasets, and fine-tune to (smaller) downstream tasks. For this, we remove the pre-trained prediction head and attach a zero-initialized D \u00d7 K feedforward layer, where K is the number of downstream classes. It is often beneficial to fine-tune at higher resolution than pre-training (Touvron et al., 2019;. When feeding images of higher resolution, we keep the patch size the same, which results in a larger effective sequence length. The Vision Transformer can handle\n7. For the baseline CNNs, we use ResNet (He et al., 2016), but replace the Batch Normalization layers (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) with Group Normalization (Wu & He, 2018), and used standardized convolutions (Qiao et al., 2019). These modifications improve transfer , and we denote the modified model \"ResNet (BiT)\". For the hybrids, we feed the intermediate feature maps into ViT with patch size of one \"pixel\". To experiment with different sequence lengths, we either (i) take the output of stage 4 of a regular\n8. Model Variants. We base ViT configurations on those used for BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), as summarized in Table 1. The \"Base\" and \"Large\" models are directly adopted from BERT and we add the larger \"Huge\" model. In what follows we use brief notation to indicate the model size and the input patch size: for instance, ViT-L/16 means the \"Large\" variant with 16 \u00d7 16 input patch size.\n9. Inspired by the Transformer scaling successes in NLP, we experiment with applying a standard Transformer directly to images, with the fewest possible modifications. To do so, we split an image into patches and provide the sequence of linear embeddings of these patches as an input to a Transformer. Image patches are treated the same way as tokens (words) in an NLP application. We train the model on image classification in supervised fashion.\n10. latter datasets as well, but train Transformers instead of ResNet-based models used in prior works. We split an image into fixed-size patches, linearly embed each of them, add position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of vectors to a standard Transformer encoder. In order to perform classification, we use the standard approach of adding an extra learnable \"classification token\" to the sequence. The illustration of the Transformer encoder was inspired by Vaswani et al. (2017).\n11. Overview of the model: we split an image into fixed-size patches, linearly embed\neach of them, add position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of\nvectors to a standard Transformer encoder. In order to perform classification,\nwe use the standard approach of adding an extra learnable \"classification token\"\nto the sequence.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide detail tokenization, resizing/rewriting (depending on the modality), etc. about the preprocessing for the data of the model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k.

Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "The preprocessing for the data of the model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Image Resizing**: Each input image is resized to a fixed resolution of H\u00d7W, where H and W are both 224 pixels for this model variant. This is implied by the model name `patch16-224`, where `224` refers to the image resolution.\n\n2. **Patch Extraction**: The resized image is then split into a grid of 2D patches. The resolution of each patch is 16\u00d716 pixels, as indicated by the `patch16` in the model name. This is derived from the reference stating that the image is reshaped into a sequence of flattened 2D patches (P, P), where P is 16 in this case.\n\n3. **Flattening and Linear Embedding**: Each patch is flattened into a 1D vector and then linearly embedded into a D-dimensional space. The dimensionality D is constant throughout the Transformer layers but is not explicitly stated in the provided references. The linear projection is trainable as mentioned in reference 4.\n\n4. **Adding Position Embeddings**: After the patches are embedded, position embeddings are added to the sequence of patch embeddings to retain positional information, as Transformers do not inherently capture the order of the input sequence.\n\n5. **Classification Token**: Similar to BERT's [class] token, a learnable embedding, referred to as the \"classification token\" or `x_class`, is prepended to the sequence of embedded patches. The state of this token at the output of the Transformer encoder serves as the image representation for classification tasks.\n\n6. **Preprocessing for Different Resolutions**: If the model is fine-tuned on images of higher resolution than the pre-training, the patch size remains the same, resulting in a larger effective sequence length due to more patches being extracted from the larger image.\n\nThe preprocessing does not involve traditional tokenization as in NLP tasks because the model operates on images rather than text. Instead, the image is tokenized into patches which are treated analogously to tokens in NLP.\n\nFor any specific code implementations or further details on the dimensionality of the embeddings or the exact architecture of the MLP used in the classification head during pre-training, [More Information Needed] would be the appropriate response as these details are not provided in the references."}

This dataset contains over 14 million images spanning 21,000 classes. The \"large\" in the model name indicates a larger model size in terms of parameters, and \"patch16-224\" specifies that the input images are split into 16x16 patches and the model expects input images of size 224x224 pixels.\n\nThe behavior of this model is influenced by several characteristics:\n\n1. **Domain and Context**: The model is trained on a diverse set of images, which means it is designed to perform well on a wide range of visual recognition tasks. However, its performance may vary when applied to specific domains that are underrepresented in the training data, such as medical imaging or satellite imagery. The context in which the model is used will also affect its behavior; for example, a model used for real-time object detection may behave differently than one used for batch processing of images due to different performance constraints.\n\n2. **Data Distribution**: The distribution of the training data plays a crucial role in the model's performance. If certain classes or types of images are overrepresented in the training set, the model may be biased towards those and perform better on them compared to underrepresented classes.\n\n3. **Population Subgroups**: The model's performance can vary across different population subgroups, especially in cases where the training data does not equally represent diversity. For instance, in facial recognition tasks, the model might perform differently across various ethnicities, ages, or genders if the training data is not balanced across these subgroups.\n\n4. **Evaluation Metrics**: The choice of evaluation metrics can influence the perceived behavior of the model. For example, using accuracy as the sole metric might overlook the model's performance on minority classes, whereas metrics like the F1 score or balanced accuracy would provide a more nuanced view of its behavior across different classes.\n\n5. **Robustness and Generalization**: The model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data is a key characteristic. Factors such as overfitting to the training data can reduce the model's robustness and its performance on external datasets.\n\n6. **Adversarial Vulnerability**: Like many deep learning models, ViT models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, where small, often imperceptible changes to the input can lead to incorrect predictions. The model's behavior in the presence of such adversarial examples is an important consideration.\n\nTo uncover disparities in performance, evaluation should be disaggregated across these factors. This means conducting separate analyses for different domains, contexts, population subgroups, and data distributions. Such disaggregated evaluation helps in identifying biases and areas where the model may require further fine-tuning or additional training data to improve its performance and fairness."], "answer": ["Datasets.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "The model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k, as a Vision Transformer (ViT), has several characteristics that will influence its behavior in various domains and contexts, as well as across different population subgroups. Based on the provided references, the following factors are important to consider:\n\n1. **Pre-training Data Size and Composition**: The model has been pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which includes 21k classes and 14M images. The size and diversity of this dataset are crucial for the model's ability to generalize across different image recognition tasks. However, the representation within the dataset may not be uniform across all classes, potentially leading to disparities in performance when the model is applied to specific subgroups or domains that are underrepresented in the training data.\n\n2. **Regularization Techniques**: The model's performance has been optimized using basic regularization parameters such as weight decay, dropout, and label smoothing. These techniques help to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization to new data. However, the effectiveness of these techniques may vary across different datasets and tasks, potentially affecting performance in certain domains or for specific population subgroups.\n\n3. **Computational Resources**: The model's pre-training efficiency is highlighted as being favorable, especially when compared to other architectures. It is mentioned that the model can be trained using a standard cloud TPUv3 with 8 cores in approximately 30 days. This suggests that the model is accessible to a wider range of researchers and practitioners, but it also implies that performance might be further improved with access to more substantial computational resources.\n\n4. **Transferability**: The model is noted to perform well when transferred to several benchmark tasks, indicating good transferability of learned features. However, the performance on tasks not covered by the benchmarks or significantly different from the pre-training data may not be as strong. This could affect the model's applicability in niche domains or for tasks with unique characteristics.\n\n5. **Scalability**: The references suggest that Vision Transformers do not saturate within the range tried, which indicates potential for future scaling efforts. This scalability could influence the model's performance as datasets grow in size and complexity, potentially benefiting tasks with large amounts of data.\n\n6. **Representation Learning**: The model's internal representations, especially in the first layer where image patches are projected into a lower-dimensional space, are crucial for its performance. The way the model processes and represents image data will affect its applicability to different image recognition tasks and its performance across various domains.\n\n7. **Bias and Fairness**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided references, it is important to consider the potential for bias in the pre-training data, which can lead to disparities in model performance across different population subgroups. An evaluation disaggregated by factors such as demographics, image types, and contexts would be necessary to uncover any such disparities.\n\nIn summary, the google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model's behavior will be influenced by its pre-training on a large and diverse dataset, the regularization techniques employed, the computational resources used for training, its transferability to various tasks, its scalability, and the quality of its internal representations. To ensure fairness and mitigate bias, a thorough evaluation across different domains, contexts, and population subgroups is essential.

Here are some common metrics that could be considered:\n\n1. **Accuracy**: This is the most straightforward metric, measuring the percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions made. It provides a general sense of the model's performance but does not account for the balance between different types of errors.\n\n2. **Precision and Recall**: Precision measures the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct, while recall measures the proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.

This is particularly relevant for models trained on datasets with a large number of classes, like ImageNet-21k.\n\nWhen evaluating the model, it is important to consider the specific application and the cost of different types of errors. For instance, in medical image analysis, a false negative (missing a disease) might be more costly than a false positive (flagging a condition that is not present). In such cases, a higher recall might be prioritized over precision. Conversely, in a content recommendation system, a false positive might lead to a poor user experience, so precision might be more important.\n\nUltimately, the choice of metrics should align with the goals of the system and the impact of different types of errors on the overall performance and user experience."]}

The \"large\" in its name refers to the size of the model in terms of the number of parameters, and `patch16-224` indicates that the input images are split into 16x16 patches and the model expects input images of size 224x224 pixels.

This is facilitated by the self-attention mechanism, which allows some attention heads to attend to most of the image from the very beginning, akin to a large receptive field in CNNs (Reference 2).\n\n2. **Attention Distance Analysis**: We have analyzed the average attention distance spanned by attention weights at different layers. The attention distance is highly variable across heads in lower layers, with some heads attending to much of the image, while others focus on small regions. As the network depth increases, the attention distance also increases for all heads, suggesting a hierarchical processing of visual information (Reference 3).\n\n3. **Attention Rollout**: To visualize how the model attends to different parts of the image, we used Attention Rollout. This method involves averaging attention weights across all heads and recursively multiplying the weight matrices of all layers, providing a map of attention from the output token to the input space (Reference 4).\n\n4. **Position Embeddings**: The model learns a learned position embedding that encodes the distance within the image. Closer patches tend to have more similar position embeddings, and there is an apparent row-column structure, indicating that the model learns spatial relationships between patches (Reference 5).\n\n5. **Internal Representation Analysis**: To begin to understand the internal processing of the Vision Transformer, we analyzed the first layer's linear projection of flattened patches into a lower-dimensional space. This analysis helps in understanding the foundational representations the model builds upon (Reference 6).\n\n6. **Scaling and Ablation Studies**: We conducted ablation studies on scaling different dimensions of the Transformer architecture. These studies help in identifying which components contribute most to the model's performance and can guide future efforts in model scaling and design (Reference 8).\n\nIn summary, our analyses provide insights into the Vision Transformer's ability to process and integrate visual information, which is essential for interpretability. The model's attention mechanisms and learned embeddings offer a window into its decision-making process, which can be further explored for improved explainability.\n\n[More Information Needed] on specific use cases or additional interpretability techniques not covered by the provided references."}

We train all models, including ResNets, using Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with \u03b2 1 = 0.9, \u03b2 2 = 0.999, a batch size of 4096 and apply a high weight decay of 0.1, which we found to be useful for transfer of all models (Appendix D.1 shows that, in contrast to common practices, Adam works slightly better than SGD for ResNets in our setting). We use a linear learning rate warmup and decay, see Appendix B.1 for details. For fine-tuning we use SGD with momentum, batch size 512, for all\n4. Figure 13, present the performance of Axial ResNet, Axial-ViT-B/32 and Axial-ViT-B/16 on Ima-geNet 5shot linear, when pretrained on JFT dataset, verses the pretraining compute, both in terms of number of FLOPs and inference time (example per seconds). As we can see, both Axial-ViT-B/32 and Axial-ViT-B/16 do better than their ViT-B counterpart in terms of performance, but it comes at the cost of more compute. This is because in Axial-ViT models, each Transformer block with global self-attention is replaced\n5. Model Variants. We base ViT configurations on those used for BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), as summarized in Table 1. The \"Base\" and \"Large\" models are directly adopted from BERT and we add the larger \"Huge\" model. In what follows we use brief notation to indicate the model size and the input patch size: for instance, ViT-L/16 means the \"Large\" variant with 16 \u00d7 16 input patch size.\n6. pre-training efficiency may be affected not only by the architecture choice, but also other parameters, such as training schedule, optimizer, weight decay, etc. We provide a controlled study of performance vs. compute for different architectures in Section 4.4. Finally, the ViT-L/16 model pre-trained on the public ImageNet-21k dataset performs well on most datasets too, while taking fewer resources to pre-train: it could be trained using a standard cloud TPUv3 with 8 cores in approximately 30 days.\n7. subsets and use the same hyper-parameters for all settings. This way, we assess the intrinsic model properties, and not the effect of regularization. We do, however, use early-stopping, and report the best validation accuracy achieved during training. To save compute, we report few-shot linear accuracy instead of full finetuning accuracy. Figure 4 contains the results. Vision Transformers overfit more than ResNets with comparable computational cost on smaller datasets. For example, ViT-B/32 is slightly\n8. Figure 5 contains the transfer performance versus total pre-training compute (see Appendix D.5 for details on computational costs). Detailed results per model are provided in Table 6 in the Appendix. A few patterns can be observed. First, Vision Transformers dominate ResNets on the performance/compute trade-off. ViT uses approximately 2 \u2212 4\u00d7 less compute to attain the same performance (average over 5 datasets). Second, hybrids slightly outperform ViT at small computational budgets, but the difference\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the amount of time used to train the model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k.

Inductive bias. We note that Vision Transformer has much less image-specific inductive bias than CNNs. In CNNs, locality, two-dimensional neighborhood structure, and translation equivariance are baked into each layer throughout the whole model. In ViT, only MLP layers are local and translationally equivariant, while the self-attention layers are global. The two-dimensional neighborhood structure is used very sparingly: in the beginning of the model by cutting the image into patches and at fine-tuning time\n2. Hybrid Architecture. As an alternative to raw image patches, the input sequence can be formed from feature maps of a CNN (LeCun et al., 1989). In this hybrid model, the patch embedding projection E (Eq. 1) is applied to patches extracted from a CNN feature map. As a special case, the patches can have spatial size 1x1, which means that the input sequence is obtained by simply flattening the spatial dimensions of the feature map and projecting to the Transformer dimension.\n3. An overview of the model is depicted in Figure 1. The standard Transformer receives as input a 1D sequence of token embeddings. To handle 2D images, we reshape the image x \u2208 R H\u00d7W \u00d7C into a sequence of flattened 2D patches x p \u2208 R N \u00d7(P 2 \u2022C) , where (H, W ) is the resolution of the original image, C is the number of channels, (P, P ) is the resolution of each image patch, and N = HW/P 2 is the resulting number of patches, which also serves as the effective input sequence length for the Transformer.

In order to perform classification,\nwe use the standard approach of adding an extra learnable \"classification token\"\nto the sequence.\n5.

Both during pre-training and fine-tuning, a classification head is attached to z 0 L . The classification head is implemented by a MLP with one hidden layer at pre-training time and by a single linear layer at fine-tuning time.\n6. classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train. 1\n7. latter datasets as well, but train Transformers instead of ResNet-based models used in prior works.

Inspired by the Transformer scaling successes in NLP, we experiment with applying a standard Transformer directly to images, with the fewest possible modifications. To do so, we split an image into patches and provide the sequence of linear embeddings of these patches as an input to a Transformer. Image patches are treated the same way as tokens (words) in an NLP application. We train the model on image classification in supervised fashion.\n9. Typically, we pre-train ViT on large datasets, and fine-tune to (smaller) downstream tasks. For this, we remove the pre-trained prediction head and attach a zero-initialized D \u00d7 K feedforward layer, where K is the number of downstream classes.

If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "The architecture of the model `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` is based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) design. The model processes images by first splitting them into fixed-size patches. Each image is reshaped from a 2D grid of pixels into a 1D sequence of flattened 2D patches. Specifically, for an image of resolution `H\u00d7W` with `C` channels, it is divided into patches of resolution `P\u00d7P`. The number of patches `N` is given by `HW/P^2`, which also defines the sequence length for the Transformer.\n\nEach patch is then linearly embedded, and position embeddings are added to retain positional information. This sequence of vectors is then fed into a standard Transformer encoder, similar to the encoders used in NLP for processing sequences of token embeddings.\n\nFor the classification objective, the model employs a learnable \"classification token\" (analogous to BERT's [class] token) that is prepended to the sequence of embedded patches. The state of this classification token at the output of the Transformer encoder serves as the image representation for classification tasks. During pre-training, a classification head with one hidden layer is attached to this token, and during fine-tuning, a single linear layer is used.\n\nThe model is pre-trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned on various mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks. When fine-tuning on higher resolution images, the patch size remains the same, resulting in a longer effective sequence length for the Transformer to process.\n\nThe `google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k` model specifically uses patches of size 16x16 on images of resolution 224x224 and is pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset. The \"large\" in the model name indicates the size of the Transformer architecture, which has more layers and parameters compared to smaller variants, allowing it to potentially capture more complex features and achieve higher accuracy on various tasks."}

As we can see, both Axial-ViT-B/32 and Axial-ViT-B/16 do better than their ViT-B counterpart in terms of performance, but it comes at the cost of more compute. This is because in Axial-ViT models, each Transformer block with global self-attention is replaced\n6. pre-training efficiency may be affected not only by the architecture choice, but also other parameters, such as training schedule, optimizer, weight decay, etc. We provide a controlled study of performance vs. compute for different architectures in Section 4.4. Finally, the ViT-L/16 model pre-trained on the public ImageNet-21k dataset performs well on most datasets too, while taking fewer resources to pre-train: it could be trained using a standard cloud TPUv3 with 8 cores in approximately 30 days.\n7. The models from this codebase were originally trained in\nhttps://github.com/google-research/big_vision/\nwhere you can find more advanced code (e.g. multi-host training), as well as\nsome of the original training scripts (e.g.\n[configs/vit_i21k.py](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/main/big_vision/configs/vit_i21k.py)\nfor pre-training a ViT, or\n[configs/transfer.py](https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/main/big_vision/configs/transfer.py)\nfor transfering a model).\n8. Figure 5 contains the transfer performance versus total pre-training compute (see Appendix D.5 for details on computational costs). Detailed results per model are provided in Table 6 in the Appendix. A few patterns can be observed. First, Vision Transformers dominate ResNets on the performance/compute trade-off. ViT uses approximately 2 \u2212 4\u00d7 less compute to attain the same performance (average over 5 datasets). Second, hybrids slightly outperform ViT at small computational budgets, but the difference\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the compute infrastructure about the model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k.
