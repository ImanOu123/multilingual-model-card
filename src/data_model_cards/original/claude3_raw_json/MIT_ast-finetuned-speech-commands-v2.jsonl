The spectrogram is then divided into patches, similar to how images are divided into patches in the ViT model. These patches are linearly projected into a sequence of embeddings, which are then fed into a standard Transformer encoder architecture.\n\nThe Transformer encoder consists of multiple layers of multi-head self-attention and feed-forward networks, which learn to capture the temporal and frequency dependencies in the audio spectrogram.

Specifically, the Code at https://github.com/YuanGongND/ast.\n2. helpful. In order to better capture long-range global context, a recent trend is to add a self-attention mechanism on top of the CNN. Such CNN-attention hybrid models have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for many audio classification tasks such as audio event classification [7,8], speech command recognition [9], and emotion recognition [10]. However, motivated by the success of purely attention-based models in the vision domain [11,12,13], it is reasonable to ask whether a CNN is still essential\n3. To answer the question, we introduce the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a convolution-free, purely attentionbased model that is directly applied to an audio spectrogram and can capture long-range global context even in the lowest layers. Additionally, we propose an approach for transferring knowledge from the Vision Transformer (ViT) [12] pretrained on ImageNet [14] to AST, which can significantly improve the performance. The advantages of AST are threefold. First, AST has superior performance: we\n4. With the advent of deep neural networks, over the last decade audio classification research has moved from models based on hand-crafted features [1,2] to end-to-end models that directly map audio spectrograms to corresponding labels [3,4,5]. Specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [6] have been widely used to learn representations from raw spectrograms for end-to-end modeling, as the inductive biases inherent to CNNs such as spatial locality and translation equivariance are believed to be\n5. for audio classification.\n6. 8.

Specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [6] have been widely used to learn representations from raw spectrograms for end-to-end modeling, as the inductive biases inherent to CNNs such as spatial locality and translation equivariance are believed to be\n5. <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/YuanGongND/ast/blob/master/ast.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Illustration of AST.\" width=\"300\"/></p>\n\nThis repository contains the official implementation (in PyTorch) of the **Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)** proposed in the Interspeech 2021 paper [AST: Audio Spectrogram Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01778) (Yuan Gong, Yu-An Chung, James Glass).\n6. 8.

In this paper, we answer the question by introducing the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), the first convolution-free, purely attention-based model for audio classification. We evaluate AST on various audio classification benchmarks, where it achieves new state-of-the-art results of 0.485 mAP on AudioSet, 95.6% accuracy on ESC-50, and 98.1% accuracy on Speech Commands V2.\n10. Over the last decade, CNNs have become a common model component for audio classification. In this work, we find CNNs are not indispensable, and introduce the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a convolution-free, purely attention-based model for audio classification which features a simple architecture and superior performance.\n11. models we use for all aforementioned tasks have the same architecture while the input lengths vary from 1 sec. (Speech Commands) to 10 sec. (AudioSet). In contrast, CNN-based models typically require architecture tuning to obtain optimal performance for different tasks. Third, comparing with SOTA CNNattention hybrid models, AST features a simpler architecture with fewer parameters, and converges faster during training. To the best of our knowledge, AST is the first purely attentionbased audio\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nIf the model MIT/ast-finetuned-speech-commands-v2 is fine-tuned from another model, provide the name and link to that base model.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model MIT/ast-finetuned-speech-commands-v2.

This model has already been trained on a large dataset of speech commands, allowing it to accurately classify audio inputs into predefined categories.\n\nTo use the model without fine-tuning, you can simply load the pre-trained weights and use the model for inference. By providing an audio input to the model, it will process the audio and output the predicted command class. This approach is particularly useful when you have limited training data or want to quickly deploy a speech command recognition system without the need for additional training.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the model's performance may be limited to the specific commands it was trained on. If you require the recognition of commands that are not part of the model's original training data, fine-tuning the model on your specific dataset can help improve its accuracy and adapt it to your particular use case.", "The MIT/ast-finetuned-speech-commands-v2 model is a pre-trained audio classification model that can be used for recognizing spoken commands without the need for post-processing. This model has been fine-tuned on the Speech Commands dataset, which consists of short audio clips of spoken words and commands.\n\nTo use the model without post-processing, you can directly feed an audio input to the model, and it will output the predicted class label corresponding to the recognized command. The model takes care of the necessary feature extraction and classification internally, eliminating the need for additional post-processing steps.\n\nHere's a general workflow for using the model without post-processing:\n\n1. Preprocess the audio input to match the expected format of the model (e.g., converting to the required sample rate and duration).\n2. Pass the preprocessed audio through the model's inference pipeline.\n3. Obtain the predicted class label from the model's output.\n4. Use the predicted label for further actions or decision-making in your application.\n\nBy leveraging the pre-trained weights and the model's architecture, you can achieve accurate speech command recognition without the need for complex post-processing techniques. This makes the MIT/ast-finetuned-speech-commands-v2 model suitable for real-time applications or scenarios where quick and direct command recognition is required.", "The MIT/ast-finetuned-speech-commands-v2 model can be used without plugging into a pipeline by directly utilizing its underlying architecture and pre-trained weights. This model is based on the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) architecture, which is designed to process audio spectrograms and perform speech command recognition tasks.\n\nTo use the model independently, you would need to preprocess your audio data into the appropriate format required by the model. This typically involves converting the audio signal into a spectrogram representation. Once you have the spectrogram, you can pass it through the pre-trained AST model to obtain the predicted speech command.\n\nThe model's architecture consists of a series of transformer layers that learn to capture the temporal and frequency patterns in the spectrogram. By feeding the spectrogram through these layers, the model generates a representation that encodes the relevant features for speech command recognition.\n\nTo make predictions, you would pass the generated representation through the model's final classification layer, which outputs the predicted probabilities for each speech command class. You can then select the class with the highest probability as the recognized speech command.\n\nBy using the MIT/ast-finetuned-speech-commands-v2 model in this manner, you have the flexibility to integrate it into your own custom pipeline or application, without relying on a predefined pipeline.

We import the necessary classes from the Transformers library and the datasets library.\n\n2. We load the pre-trained AST model and its corresponding feature extractor using the `from_pretrained()` method, specifying the model checkpoint \"MIT/ast-finetuned-speech-commands-v2\".\n\n3. We load the audio dataset using the `load_dataset()` function from the datasets library, assuming the dataset is stored in the \"path/to/dataset\" directory.\n\n4. We preprocess the audio by extracting the audio array from the first sample in the dataset and passing it to the feature extractor along with the sampling rate. The feature extractor converts the audio into the required input format for the model.\n\n5. We perform inference by passing the preprocessed audio inputs to the model and obtain the logits (raw predictions).\n\n6. We determine the predicted class ID by finding the index of the maximum logit value using `argmax()`.\n\n7. We map the predicted class ID to its corresponding label using the `id2label` attribute of the model's configuration.\n\n8.

To summarize, while the input audio length varies from 1 sec. (Speech Commands), 5 sec. (ESC-50) to 10 sec. (AudioSet) and content varies from speech (Speech Commands) to non-speech (Au-dioSet and ESC-50), we use a fixed AST architecture for all three benchmarks and achieve SOTA results on all of them.

Applying it outside its intended use case could lead to poor performance or misclassifications.\n- [More Information Needed] on potential biases in the training data that could lead to unfair or discriminatory model outputs.\n\nTechnical limitations: \n- The model expects 16kHz audio input that is roughly normalized to 0 mean and 0.5 std (ref 4). Using audio that deviates significantly from this could degrade performance.\n- A fixed AST architecture is used which may not be optimal for all speech classification tasks (ref 10).\n- [More Information Needed] on compute requirements and latency which could limit real-time applications.\n\nSociotechnical limitations:\n- As a speech classifier, the model has no contextual understanding. Outputs should be carefully interpreted based on the specific application. \n- [More Information Needed] on how the model handles sensitive content and potential privacy concerns with classifying human speech.\n\nTo summarize, key limitations appear to be the narrow training domain, fixed input requirements, and lack of contextual awareness. More information is needed to fully characterize potential biases, resource requirements, and sociotechnical implications. Responsible usage requires understanding these constraints and carefully validating the model's fitness for a given real-world application."}

For evaluating the performance of such a speech recognition model, some commonly used metrics include:\n\nAccuracy: The overall accuracy in correctly identifying the spoken commands across a test set of audio samples. This measures what percentage of commands the model gets right.\n\nPrecision and Recall: Precision measures, for a given predicted command, how often the model is correct. Recall measures, for actual instances of a certain command, how often the model correctly identifies it. These provide a more detailed look at performance on each command.\n\nF1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's ability to avoid false positives and false negatives.\n\nConfusion Matrix: A table showing actual vs predicted commands, which helps visualize which commands the model mixes up most often.\n\nWord Error Rate (WER): Compares the model's transcription to the reference, counting substitutions, deletions and insertions as errors. Lower WER is better.\n\nSo in summary, a combination of accuracy, precision/recall, F1 scores, confusion matrices, and WER are likely to be the key metrics used to thoroughly evaluate this model's performance at its speech command recognition task.", "When considering the tradeoffs between different errors in the MIT/ast-finetuned-speech-commands-v2 model, it's important to understand the two main types of errors: false positives and false negatives.\n\nFalse positives occur when the model incorrectly identifies a speech command that was not actually spoken. This can lead to unintended actions being triggered by the system, which may be inconvenient or even dangerous in certain situations.\n\nFalse negatives, on the other hand, happen when the model fails to recognize a spoken command that was actually given. This can result in the desired action not being performed, leading to frustration for the user and potentially missing important instructions.\n\nThe tradeoff between these two types of errors depends on the specific application of the model.

AST is a transformer-based model designed for audio classification tasks.\n\nThe model architecture consists of the following components:\n\n1. Spectrogram Extraction: The input audio waveform is converted into a spectrogram representation using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The spectrogram captures the time-frequency information of the audio signal.\n\n2. Patch Embedding: The spectrogram is divided into patches, and each patch is linearly projected into a lower-dimensional embedding space. This step helps to reduce the spatial dimensions of the spectrogram while preserving the essential features.\n\n3. Transformer Encoder: The patch embeddings are passed through a stack of transformer encoder layers. Each encoder layer consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. The self-attention mechanism captures the dependencies between different patches, allowing the model to learn the temporal and frequency relationships in the audio signal.\n\n4. Classification Head: The output of the transformer encoder is passed through a classification head, which typically consists of a linear layer followed by a softmax activation function. The classification head maps the learned representations to the corresponding class probabilities.\n\nThe MIT/ast-finetuned-speech-commands-v2 model is a fine-tuned version of the AST model, specifically trained on the Speech Commands dataset. The fine-tuning process adapts the pre-trained AST model to the specific task of speech command recognition.\n\nThe AST architecture has shown strong performance on various audio classification tasks, including speech command recognition. Its ability to capture long-range dependencies and learn meaningful representations from spectrograms makes it well-suited for processing and classifying audio signals.", "The objective of the MIT/ast-finetuned-speech-commands-v2 model is to accurately recognize and classify spoken commands and keywords from audio input. This model has been fine-tuned on the Speech Commands dataset, which contains short utterances of specific words and phrases. The model aims to identify and differentiate between these spoken commands, such as \"yes,\" \"no,\" \"up,\" \"down,\" \"left,\" \"right,\" \"on,\" \"off,\" \"stop,\" and \"go.\" By accurately classifying these speech commands, the model can be used in various applications that require voice-based interaction and control, such as virtual assistants, smart home devices, or voice-controlled interfaces."]}

For balanced set experiments, we use an initial learning rate of 5e-5\n3. and train the model for 25 epochs, the learning rate is cut into half every 5 epoch after the 10th epoch. For full set experiments, we use an initial learning rate of 1e-5 and train the model for 5 epochs, the learning rate is cut into half every epoch after the 2nd epoch. We use the mean average precision (mAP) as our main evaluation metric.\n4. AudioSet [15] is a collection of over 2 million 10-second audio clips excised from YouTube videos and labeled with the sounds that the clip contains from a set of 527 labels. The balanced training, full training, and evaluation set contains 22k, 2M, and 20k samples, respectively. For AudioSet experiments, we use the exact same training pipeline with [8].
