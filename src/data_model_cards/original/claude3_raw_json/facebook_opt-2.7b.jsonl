The pre-training corpus contains a concatenation of datasets used in RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), the Pile (Gao et al., 2021a), and PushShift.io Reddit (Baumgartner et al., 2020;Roller et al., 2021). All corpora were previously collected or filtered to contain predominantly English text, but a small amount of non-English data is still present within the corpus via CommonCrawl.

We use an AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) with (\u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 ) set to (0.9, 0.95), and weight decay of 0.1. We follow a linear learning rate schedule, warming up from 0 to the maximum learning rate over the first 2000 steps in OPT-175B, or over 375M tokens in our smaller baselines, and decaying down to 10% of the maximum LR over 300B tokens. A number of mid-flight changes to LR were also required (see Section 2.5). Our batch sizes range from 0.5M to 4M depending on the model size (see Table 1)\n3. PushShift.io Reddit We included a subset of the Pushshift.io corpus produced by Baumgartner et al. (2020) and previously used by Roller et al. (2021).

This reduced the corpus by about 66%.\n4. We tokenize all corpora using the GPT-2 byte level BPE tokenizer (Sennrich et al., 2016;Radford et al., 2019;Brown et al., 2020).

This CC-News v2 corpus was preprocessed the same way as the original RoBERTa CCNews (Liu et al., 2019b).\n5. For weight initialization, we follow the same settings provided in the Megatron-LM codebase, 4 using a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation of 0.006. Standard deviation for output layers are scaled by a 1.0/ \u221a 2L term where L is the total number of layers.

This can be done by including context, instructions, or examples within the prompt itself.\n\nFor instance, if you want the model to generate a summary of an article, you can feed it a prompt like: \"Please summarize the following article: [article text]\". The model will then use its pre-trained knowledge to generate a concise summary based on the given article.\n\nPrompt engineering requires a good understanding of the model's strengths and limitations, as well as experimentation to find the most effective prompts for specific tasks. By leveraging the model's vast pre-trained knowledge through carefully designed prompts, OPT-2.7B can be used for various natural language processing tasks without the need for fine-tuning.", "The facebook/opt-2.7b model is a large language model that can be used for various natural language processing tasks without the need for extensive post-processing. This model has been pre-trained on a vast amount of text data, allowing it to generate human-like responses to given prompts or questions.\n\nTo use the model without post-processing, you can simply input your desired text or question into the model and let it generate a response based on its pre-trained knowledge. The model's output will be a coherent and contextually relevant piece of text that directly addresses the input prompt.\n\nFor example, if you input a question like \"What are the main advantages of solar energy?\" the model will generate a response that discusses the benefits of solar energy, such as its renewable nature, low environmental impact, and potential cost savings over time. The generated text will be ready to use without the need for additional editing or processing.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the model can produce high-quality responses without post-processing, it may occasionally generate text that contains factual inaccuracies or biased information. Therefore, it is always a good idea to review the model's output critically and verify the information against reliable sources if necessary.", "The facebook/opt-2.7b model can be used without plugging it into a pipeline by directly utilizing the model's tokenizer and the model itself. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Load the tokenizer:\n   - Import the AutoTokenizer class from the transformers library.\n   - Use the `from_pretrained()` method to load the tokenizer specific to the facebook/opt-2.7b model.\n\n2. Tokenize the input:\n   - Pass the input text to the tokenizer's `encode()` method to convert it into a sequence of token IDs.\n   - Optionally, you can specify additional parameters like `max_length`, `padding`, and `truncation` to control the tokenization process.\n\n3. Load the model:\n   - Import the AutoModelForCausalLM class from the transformers library.\n   - Use the `from_pretrained()` method to load the pre-trained facebook/opt-2.7b model.\n\n4. Generate output:\n   - Pass the tokenized input to the model's `generate()` method to generate the output text.\n   - You can specify various generation parameters like `max_length`, `num_beams`, `temperature`, etc., to control the generation process.\n\n5. Decode the output:\n   - Use the tokenizer's `decode()` method to convert the generated token IDs back into human-readable text.\n\nBy following these steps, you can directly use the facebook/opt-2.7b model for text generation tasks without the need for a pipeline. This approach provides more flexibility and control over the tokenization and generation process compared to using a pre-built pipeline.", "Here's a short passage answering the question about the model facebook/opt-2.7b, including a code snippet demonstrating its usage:\n\nThe facebook/opt-2.7b model is a large language model developed by Facebook AI. It has 2.7 billion parameters and is trained on a diverse dataset of web pages, books, and articles. This model can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, question answering, and language translation.\n\nTo use the facebook/opt-2.7b model, you can leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python. Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to load the model and generate text:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\nmodel_name = \"facebook/opt-2.7b\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\nprompt = \"Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\noutput = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)\ngenerated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n1. We import the necessary classes from the Transformers library.\n2. We specify the name of the model we want to use, in this case, \"facebook/opt-2.7b\".\n3. We create an instance of the tokenizer and the model using the `from_pretrained()` method.\n4. We define a prompt that serves as the starting point for text generation.\n5. We encode the prompt using the tokenizer and convert it to PyTorch tensors.\n6. We generate text using the `generate()` method of the model, specifying the maximum length of the generated text and the number of sequences to return.\n7. We decode the generated output using the tokenizer and print the resulting text.\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to load the facebook/opt-2.7b model and generate text based on a given prompt. The model will continue the text from the prompt, providing a coherent and contextually relevant continuation."]}

Fine-tuning involves taking the pre-trained weights of the model and adjusting them using task-specific data, allowing the model to learn the nuances and requirements of the target task.\n\nFor example, if the task is sentiment analysis, the model would be fine-tuned using a dataset containing text examples along with their corresponding sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral). During fine-tuning, the model learns to associate certain patterns and features in the input text with the appropriate sentiment labels, enabling it to make accurate predictions on new, unseen text data.\n\nFine-tuning the facebook/opt-2.7b model offers several advantages:\n\n1. Transfer learning: The model has already been pre-trained on a large corpus of text data, allowing it to capture general language patterns and knowledge.

Tokenization: The input text is split into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, subwords, or characters. The OPT models use a byte-level BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding) tokenizer, which helps in handling out-of-vocabulary words and reduces the vocabulary size.\n\n2. Sequence Length Adjustment: The tokenized input is then resized to a fixed sequence length. If the input is shorter than the desired sequence length, padding tokens are added to the end of the sequence. If the input is longer, it is truncated to fit within the specified sequence length.\n\n3. Conversion to Input IDs: Each token in the resized input is then converted into its corresponding integer ID based on the model's vocabulary. This step maps the tokens to a format that the model can process.\n\n4. Attention Mask Creation: An attention mask is generated to indicate which tokens in the input sequence are actual tokens and which are padding tokens.

{"question": "preprocessing", "chain": "rev_retrieval", "prompt": ["The Facebook OPT-2.7B model uses a byte-level Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization for preprocessing the training data. BPE is a subword tokenization algorithm that iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of bytes to create a vocabulary of subword units. This allows the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words and efficiently represent a large corpus of text with a fixed-size vocabulary.\n\nThe tokenization process for the OPT-2.7B model can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. The input text is first normalized by converting it to lowercase and removing any special characters or punctuation marks.\n\n2. The normalized text is then split into a sequence of bytes, which are the basic units for the BPE algorithm.\n\n3. The BPE algorithm iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of bytes to create a vocabulary of subword units. This process continues until a desired vocabulary size is reached or no more frequent pairs can be merged.\n\n4. The resulting vocabulary is then used to tokenize the input text by replacing each subword unit with its corresponding token ID.\n\n5. The tokenized text is then fed into the model for training or inference.\n\nThe specific details of the tokenization process, such as the vocabulary size and the merging rules, are not publicly disclosed for the OPT-2.7B model. However, the use of BPE tokenization allows the model to handle a large and diverse corpus of text efficiently while still maintaining a fixed-size vocabulary.", "The facebook/opt-2.7b model, like other large language models, requires preprocessing of the input data before training. The preprocessing steps may vary depending on the modality of the data, such as text, images, or audio.\n\nFor text data, the preprocessing typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Tokenization: The input text is split into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, subwords, or characters. The OPT models use a byte-level BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding) tokenizer, which helps in handling out-of-vocabulary words and reduces the vocabulary size.\n\n2. Sequence Length Adjustment: The tokenized input is then resized to a fixed sequence length. If the input is shorter than the desired sequence length, padding tokens are added to the end of the sequence. If the input is longer, it is truncated to fit within the specified sequence length.\n\n3. Conversion to Input IDs: Each token in the resized input is then converted into its corresponding integer ID based on the model's vocabulary. This step maps the tokens to a format that the model can process.\n\n4. Attention Mask Creation: An attention mask is generated to indicate which tokens in the input sequence are actual tokens and which are padding tokens. This mask helps the model focus on the relevant parts of the input during training and inference.\n\nFor other modalities, such as images or audio, the preprocessing steps would differ. Images may need to be resized, normalized, and converted into a suitable format (e.g., tensors), while audio data may require techniques like resampling, normalization, and feature extraction.\n\nThe specific preprocessing details for the facebook/opt-2.7b model may vary depending on the implementation and the task at hand. However, the general idea is to convert the input data into a format that the model can effectively process and learn from during training."], "answer": ["has never been publicly released, and achieved 10.7 ppl and .185 UF1, matching the performance of the validation set.

We trained OPT-175B on 992 80GB A100 GPUs, by utilizing Fully Sharded Data Parallel (Artetxe et al., 2021) with Megatron-LM Tensor Parallelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019). We achieve utilization of up to 147 TFLOP/s per GPU. We keep Adam state in FP32, since we shard it across all hosts, while the model weights remained in FP16. To avoid underflows, we used dynamic loss scaling, as described in Micikevicius et al. (2017).\n2. Hardware Failures We faced a significant number of hardware failures in our compute cluster while training OPT-175B. In total, hardware failures contributed to at least 35 manual restarts and the cycling of over 100 hosts over the course of 2 months. During manual restarts, the training run was paused, and a series of diagnostics tests were conducted to detect problematic nodes. Flagged nodes were then cordoned off and training was resumed from the last saved checkpoint. Given the difference between the\n3. 1.0), and after which our activation norms would trend downward instead of growing unboundedly. Our empirical LR schedule is shown in Figure 1. Early in training, we also noticed that lowering gradient clipping from 1.0 to 0.3 helped with stability; see our released logbook for exact details. Figure 2 shows our validation loss with respect to training iterations.\n4. Loss Divergences Loss divergences were also an issue in our training run. When the loss diverged, we found that lowering the learning rate and restarting from an earlier checkpoint allowed for the job to recover and continue training. We noticed a correlation between loss divergence, our dynamic loss  scalar crashing to 0, and the l 2 -norm of the activations of the final layer spiking. These observations led us to pick restart points for which our dynamic loss scalar was still in a \"healthy\" state (\u2265\n5. Other Mid-flight Changes We conducted a number of other experimental mid-flight changes to handle loss divergences. These included: switching to vanilla SGD (optimization plateaued quickly, and we reverted back to AdamW); resetting the dynamic loss scalar (this helped recover some but not all divergences); and switching to a newer version of Megatron (this reduced pressure on activation norms and improved throughput).\n6. \u2022 Person or organization developing model: OPT-175B was developed by Meta AI.\n\u2022 Model date: OPT-175B was released on May 3, 2022.\n\u2022 Model version: OPT-175B described in this paper is version 1.0.0.\n\u2022 Model type: OPT-175B is a large decoder-only transformer language model.\n7. \u2022 Paper or other resource for more information: See the rest of this paper for more details on OPT-175B as well as the corresponding post on the Meta AI Research Blog.

Similar to our zero-shot evaluation, we hypothesize our one-and few-shot evaluation setup may differ significantly from Brown et al. (2020).\n6. Results are presented in Table 3. With all of our one-shot through few-shot configurations, OPT-175B performs considerably better than Davinci. We speculate this occurs from two sources: (1) evaluating via the Davinci API may be bringing in safety control mechanisms beyond the original 175B GPT-3 model used in Brown et al. (2020); and (2) the significant presence of unmoderated social media discussions in the pre-training dataset has provided additional inductive bias to aid in such classification tasks.\n7. Results are shown in Figure 5. Overall, we see that OPT-175B has a higher toxicity rate than either PaLM or Davinci. We also observe that all 3 models have increased likelihood of generating toxic continuations as the toxicity of the prompt increases, which is consistent with the observations of Chowdhery et al. (2022). As with our experiments in hate speech detection, we suspect the inclusion of unmoderated social media texts in the pre-training corpus raises model familiarity with, and therefore\n8. Using the ETHOS dataset provided in Mollas et al.

In the zero-, one-,  .672 .812 and few-shot binary cases, the model is presented with text and asked to consider whether the text is racist or sexist and provide a yes/no response.

To understand the potential harm of OPT-175B, we evaluate a series of benchmarks related to hate speech detection, stereotype awareness, and toxic content generation. While there may be shortcomings in these benchmarks (Blodgett et al., 2021;Jacobs and Wallach, 2021), these measurements provide a first step towards understanding the limitations of OPT-175B.

For the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) task in the SuperGLUE benchmark, we follow (Brown et al., 2020) and formulate the task as multiple choice questions, which is known to affect performance .\n4. We evaluate our model on 16 standard NLP tasks utilized in the literature: HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), StoryCloze (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016), PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), ARC Easy and Challenge , OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), WinoGrad (Levesque et al., 2011), Wino-Grande (Sakaguchi et al., 2020), and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019). We follow GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) by using their prompts and overall experimental setup. We compare primarily to GPT-3, having aimed to re-implement their evaluation\n5. Our performance roughly matched GPT-3 for 10 tasks, and underperformed in 3 tasks (ARC Challenge and MultiRC).

OPT-175B can also have quality issues in terms of generation diversity and hallucination. In general, OPT-175B is not immune from the plethora of issues that plague modern large language models. By releasing with a non-commercial license, we also hope to increase communication, transparency,\n7. Similar to other LLMs, OPT-175B can produce factually incorrect statements (Adiwardana et al., 2020;Brown et al., 2020;Roller et al., 2021;Rae et al., 2021;Chowdhery et al., 2022;Thoppilan et al., 2022). This can be particularly harmful in applications where information accuracy is critical, such as healthcare and scientific discovery (Weidinger et al., 2021b). Recently, several efforts have reported that retrieval-augmented models can improve factual correctness of LLMs (Lewis et al., 2020;Komeili et al.,\n8. and study of the problems of large language models, especially in areas which may not be aligned with commercial interests. See Section 5 for a more detailed discussion of limitations of OPT-175B.\n9. \u2022 Data selection for evaluation: Evaluations in this paper were chosen to provide comparable performance assessments relative to similar scale models in the literature. Given concerns in the community around safety and fairness of large language models in general, we also explicitly provide evaluations on Responsible AI (see Section 4).\n10. Results are shown in Table 2. We see that OPT-175B significantly outperforms the alsounsupervised Reddit 2.7B model on all tasks, and performs competitively with the fully supervised BlenderBot 1 model, especially in the ConvAI2 dataset. On the Wizard-of-Internet dataset, which is fully unsupervised for all models, we see that OPT-175B obtains the lowest perplexity but still has lower UF1 than the models with Wizard-of-Wikipedia supervision.\n11.

The 2.7B model may have similar toxicity issues.\n- Inclusion of unmoderated social media texts in pre-training likely raises familiarity with hate speech and toxic language (References 2-4).\n- [More Information Needed] on specific bias and toxicity evaluations for the 2.7B model.\n\nTraining Data:\n- [More Information Needed] on the exact training data used for the 2.7B model. The full OPT models used a dataset that included unmoderated social media discussions (Reference 1).\n\nOther Notes:\n- The 2.7B model is one of the smaller baseline models being released, while the 175B requires a request for research access (Reference 11).\n- [More Information Needed] on model architecture, hyperparameters, compute used, etc for the 2.7B model specifically.\n\nIn summary, more targeted evaluation is needed to fully characterize the performance, limitations, training data, and technical details of the facebook/opt-2.7b model based on the provided references that focus more on the larger 175B model. The smaller model likely exhibits some of the same concerning behaviors around toxicity and bias as the 175B model, but to an unknown degree without further study."}
