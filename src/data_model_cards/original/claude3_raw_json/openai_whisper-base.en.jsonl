Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on 25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10\n3. A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification\n4. segments was used, and the models are trained for 2 20 updates which is between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern, and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness. Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters. 3 During early development and evaluation we observed that Whisper models had a\n5. We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000;Chen et al., 2016). Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013) with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256\n6. These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as speech recognition 1 . This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine\n7. We study the capabilities of speech processing systems trained simply to predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervision, the resulting models generalize well to standard benchmarks and are often competitive with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models approach their accuracy and robustness. We are releasing models and\n8. As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize much more effectively to held-out datasets than models trained on a single source. These works achieve this by combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a moderate amount of this data easily available.\n9. Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale text from the internet for training machine learning systems, we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies the speech recognition pipeline since it\n10. Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.\n11.

We'd like to thank the millions of people who were involved in creating the data used by Whisper. We'd also like to thank Nick Ryder, Will Zhuk, and Andrew Carr for the conversation on the waterfall hike that inspired this project. We are also grateful to the Acceleration and Supercomputing teams at OpenAI for their critical work on software and hardware infrastructure this project used. We'd also like to thank Pamela Mishkin for advising the project from a policy perspective.

Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual. They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not\n4. transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly, we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to more directly optimize for decoding performance could help further reduce these errors.\n5. Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages As Figure 3 shows, Whisper's speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount of training data for the language.

The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000 hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could be further improved by a combination of longer training and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing the end of performance improvements from dataset size scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to characterize \"scaling laws\" for\n5. model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was performed on an exponential moving average estimate of the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance on English and multilingual speech recognition and X\u2192en translation is reported in Table 6.  All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all\n6. To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper using our normalizer versus an independently developed one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces the WER of Whisper models' significantly more.

For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model we aggregated information about its error rate on training data sources and performed manual inspection of these data sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated captions that filtering\n8. Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In order to avoid learning \"transcript-ese\", we developed many heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset.

It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.\n10. Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages As Figure 3 shows, Whisper's speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount of training data for the language. Since our pre-training dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have\n11. tendency to transcribe plausible but almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.

As an ASR model, its primary purpose is to transcribe spoken English into written text. Several domain and context characteristics can influence the model's behavior and performance:\n\n1. Accent and dialect: The model's performance may vary depending on the speaker's accent or dialect. If the model was primarily trained on a specific accent or dialect, it might struggle with others.\n\n2. Background noise: The presence of background noise in the audio can affect the model's ability to accurately transcribe speech. Noise can include ambient sounds, music, or other speakers talking simultaneously.\n\n3. Audio quality: The quality of the input audio, such as its clarity, volume, and potential distortions, can impact the model's performance. Low-quality audio may lead to less accurate transcriptions.\n\n4. Domain-specific vocabulary: If the audio contains domain-specific terminology or jargon that the model has not encountered during training, it may struggle to transcribe those terms accurately.\n\n5. Speaking style: The model's performance can be influenced by the speaker's style, such as their speed, clarity of pronunciation, and use of filler words (e.g., \"um,\" \"uh\").\n\n6. Context-dependent words: Some words may sound similar but have different spellings depending on the context (e.g., \"their,\" \"there,\" \"they're\"). The model might struggle to choose the correct spelling without understanding the broader context of the speech.\n\nTo achieve the best results, it is essential to use high-quality audio input, minimize background noise, and be aware of the model's potential limitations in handling various accents, dialects, and domain-specific vocabulary.", "The openai/whisper-base.en model is an English-only speech recognition model developed by OpenAI. As such, the model's performance may be influenced by various population subgroup characteristics related to English language usage and speech patterns. Some foreseeable factors that could impact the model's behavior include:\n\n1. Accents and dialects: The model's performance may vary depending on the speaker's accent or dialect. If the model was primarily trained on a specific accent (e.g., American English), it might have difficulty accurately transcribing speech from individuals with different accents (e.g., British English, Indian English, or African American Vernacular English).\n\n2. Age: The model's performance may be affected by the age of the speaker. Children and elderly individuals may have different speech patterns, pronunciation, and vocabulary compared to adults, which could influence the model's accuracy.\n\n3. Socioeconomic background: An individual's socioeconomic background can impact their language use, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The model's performance may be influenced by how well it was trained on a diverse range of socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\n4. Education level: The speaker's education level can affect their vocabulary, grammar, and language complexity. If the model was primarily trained on speech from individuals with higher education levels, it may struggle with transcribing speech from those with lower education levels, and vice versa.\n\n5. Domain-specific language: If the model was not trained on domain-specific language (e.g., medical, legal, or technical terminology), it may have difficulty accurately transcribing speech containing such vocabulary.\n\nTo ensure the model performs well across various population subgroups, it is essential to train the model on a diverse dataset that includes a wide range of accents, ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, education levels, and domain-specific language.", "Based on the available information about the openai/whisper-base.en model, it is unclear whether the evaluation of the model has been disaggregated across various factors to uncover potential disparities in performance. The documentation and research papers related to this specific model do not provide explicit details about conducting a disaggregated evaluation to identify performance differences across different subgroups or factors such as gender, age, accent, or other demographic variables. To comprehensively answer this question, more information from the model developers or additional evaluation studies would be needed to determine if such an analysis has been carried out to assess the model's fairness and identify any biases or disparities in its performance across different populations."]}

The WER measures the accuracy of the transcription by comparing the number of errors (substitutions, deletions, and insertions) made by the model to the total number of words in the reference transcription.\n\nOther potential metrics that could be used to assess the model's performance include:\n\n1. Character Error Rate (CER): Similar to WER, but measured at the character level instead of the word level.\n\n2. Perplexity: A measure of how well the language model predicts the next word in a sequence, which can indicate the model's understanding of language patterns.\n\n3. Inference time: The time taken by the model to process and transcribe a given audio sample, which is important for real-time applications.\n\n4. Robustness to noise and accents: Evaluating the model's performance on audio samples with varying levels of background noise and different accents to assess its reliability in real-world scenarios.\n\nThe specific metrics used may vary depending on the intended application and the research goals of the team evaluating the model.", "When considering the tradeoffs between different errors in the openai/whisper-base.en model, it's important to understand the model's purpose and limitations. This model is designed for English speech recognition and transcription.\n\nOne tradeoff is between accuracy and speed. The model may prioritize faster processing times at the expense of some accuracy in transcription. Balancing these two factors depends on the specific use case and requirements.\n\nAnother tradeoff involves the model's performance on different accents, dialects, and background noise levels. The model may have higher error rates when transcribing speech with heavy accents or in noisy environments compared to clear, standard English audio. Improving performance on edge cases often requires more training data and computational resources.\n\nThere is also a tradeoff between the model's size and its performance. The openai/whisper-base.en model is a base-sized model, which offers good performance while remaining relatively lightweight. However, larger models in the Whisper family, like the medium and large variants, generally provide higher accuracy at the cost of increased computational requirements and slower inference speeds.\n\nUltimately, the choice of model depends on the specific needs of the application, considering factors such as the desired accuracy, inference speed, model size, and the characteristics of the audio data being transcribed."]}

This is particularly challenging for zero-shot models like Whisper that don't observe dataset-specific transcript formats.

This normalizer was iteratively refined through manual inspection. The code for the normalizer is being released to enable fair comparisons. (References 2-3, 5) \n\n- Character Error Rate (CER) is used as an additional metric for some languages.

Distributions of WER from Whisper, commercial services, and the best open-source model were compared.

To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8.

The diminishing returns for English speech recognition could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9\n2. The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech processing system that works reliably without the need for dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper\n3. Whisper models which we investigate in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others study the performance of speech recognition systems in out-of-distribution settings.\n4. particularly acute for zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any examples of specific datasets transcript formats. This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an active area of research, and while there are some promising methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation to minimize penalization of\n5. non-semantic differences. Our text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a quirk such as a dataset's reference transcripts seperating contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the transcription style of\n6. STT model we used their buffered inference implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets, especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative robustness of\n7. We compare the performance with open-source models as well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services, as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models.

The model architecture consists of the following main components:\n\n1. Encoder: The encoder is a stack of transformer layers that processes the input audio features. It consists of self-attention layers and feed-forward neural networks (FFNs) that learn to capture the temporal dependencies and extract meaningful representations from the audio input.\n\n2. Decoder: The decoder is another stack of transformer layers that generates the text output based on the encoded representations from the encoder. It also employs self-attention layers and FFNs, along with cross-attention layers that attend to the encoder's output at each decoding step.\n\n3. Positional Encoding: Since transformers are position-invariant, positional encoding is added to the input features to provide information about the relative position of each time step in the audio sequence.\n\n4. Convolutional Layers: Before the audio features are fed into the encoder, they pass through a series of convolutional layers. These layers help in learning local patterns and reducing the sequence length of the input, which improves computational efficiency.\n\nThe openai/whisper-base.en model is a specific instance of the Whisper architecture that has been pre-trained on a large corpus of English speech data. It has a moderate number of parameters compared to larger variants like openai/whisper-large, making it suitable for various English ASR tasks while balancing performance and computational requirements.", "The objective of the model \"openai/whisper-base.en\" is to perform automatic speech recognition (ASR) specifically for the English language. This model is part of the Whisper family of models developed by OpenAI, which are designed to transcribe spoken language into written text.\n\nThe \"base.en\" variant of the Whisper model is a compact and efficient model that focuses on English language transcription. It aims to accurately convert English speech into text, enabling applications such as speech-to-text transcription, subtitling, and voice-based user interfaces.\n\nBy specializing in English, the \"openai/whisper-base.en\" model can achieve high accuracy and performance in transcribing English speech, while being computationally efficient compared to larger, multilingual models. This makes it suitable for various use cases where English speech recognition is required, such as in voice assistants, transcription services, and audio analysis tools."]}
