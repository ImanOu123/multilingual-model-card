We instruction-finetune on a collection of data sources (Figure 2) with a variety of instruction template types (Figure 3). We call this finetuning procedure Flan (Finetuning language models; Wei et al., 2021) and prepend \"Flan\" to the resulting finetuned models (e.g., Flan-PaLM). 2 We show that Flan works across several model sizes and architectures (Table 2).\n2. Flan-T5-small has 77 million weights. Flan-T5-base has 250 million weights. Flan-T5-large has 780 million weights. Flan-T5-XL has 3 billion weights. Flan-T5-XXL has 11 billion weights. See Table 2 for details.\n3. Dense encoder-decoder models of 5 different sizes. See Table 2.\n4. For each size PaLM model, we fine tuned an equivalent version of Flan. The largest models, Flan-PaLM and Flan-U-PaLM, have 540 billion parameters. We also have 62-billion and 6-billion parameter models. See Table 2 for details.\n5. chosen based on periodic evaluations (every 2k to 10k steps depending the model size) of the held-out tasks, and we used the same number of checkpoint steps across all ablation runs for a given model. Notably, the amount of compute used for finetuning is only a small fraction relative to the training compute, as shown in Table 2. For example, we only use 0.2% of the pre-training compute to instruction-finetune Flan-PaLM 540B (approximately 512 v4 TPU chips for 37 hours). We use the JAX-based T5X framework\n6. al., 2021;Dai et al., 2022) and program synthesis data (Yasunaga and Liang, 2020;Li et al., 2022). T0-SF (193 tasks) comprises tasks from T0 (Sanh et al., 2021) that do not overlap with the data used in Muffin (SF stands for \"sans Flan\"). NIV2 (1554 tasks) comprises tasks from Wang et al. (2022c). 4 Figure 3: Combinations of finetuning data formats in this work. We finetune with and without exemplars, and also with and without chain-of-thought. In addition, we have some data formats without instructions\n7. In this paper, we apply instruction finetuning across a broad range of model families, including T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and U-PaLM (Tay et al., 2022b). These model families span a range of sizes, from Flan-T5-small (80M parameters), to PaLM and U-PaLM (540B parameters). For each model, we apply the same training procedure, except for a few hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, dropout, and finetuning steps. We use a constant learning rate schedule and finetune using\n8. Task mixtures. Prior literature has shown that increasing the number of tasks in finetuning with instructions improves generalization to unseen tasks (Wei et al., 2021;Sanh et al., 2021, inter alia). In this paper we scale to 1,836 finetuning tasks by combining four mixtures from prior work: Muffin, T0-SF, NIV2, and CoT, as summarized in Figure 2. Muffin 3 (80 tasks) comprises 62 tasks from Wei et al. (2021) and 26 new tasks that we added in this work, including dialog data (Byrne et al., 2019;Anantha et\n9.

For example, we only use 0.2% of the pre-training compute to instruction-finetune Flan-PaLM 540B (approximately 512 v4 TPU chips for 37 hours). We use the JAX-based T5X framework\n4. In this paper, we apply instruction finetuning across a broad range of model families, including T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and U-PaLM (Tay et al., 2022b). These model families span a range of sizes, from Flan-T5-small (80M parameters), to PaLM and U-PaLM (540B parameters). For each model, we apply the same training procedure, except for a few hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, dropout, and finetuning steps. We use a constant learning rate schedule and finetune using\n5. the Adafactor optimizer (Shazeer and Stern, 2018). We use packing (Raffel et al., 2020) to combine multiple training examples into a single sequence, separating inputs from targets using an end-of-sequence token. Masking is applied to prevent the tokens from attending to others across the packed example boundary. The number of finetuning steps, learning rate, batch size, and dropout for each model are given in Appendix E. For each model, we use a single checkpoint for all evaluations; the optimal step was\n6. Model Initialization These models are based on pretrained T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and fine-tuned with instructions for better zero-shot and few-shot performance. There is one fine-tuned Flan model per T5 model size.\n7. Dense encoder-decoder models of 5 different sizes. See Table 2.\n8. System Description This is a standalone model.\n9. Model Initialization These models are based on pretrained T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and fine-tuned with instructions for better zero-shot and few-shot performance.

In addition, we showed that instruction finetuning combines well with other model adaptation techniques such as UL2R (Tay et al., 2022b), resulting in the strongest model that we trained in this work (Flan-U-PaLM).\n11. Flan-T5 has not been tested in real world applications.\nEthical Considerations & Risks Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases.

Muffin 3 (80 tasks) comprises 62 tasks from Wei et al. (2021) and 26 new tasks that we added in this work, including dialog data (Byrne et al., 2019;Anantha et\n6. Chain-of-thought finetuning mixture. The fourth finetuning data mixture (reasoning) involves CoT annotations, which we use to explore whether finetuning on CoT annotations improves performance on unseen reasoning tasks. We create a new mixture of nine datasets from prior work for which human raters manually wrote CoT annotations for a training corpus. These nine datasets include tasks such as arithmetic reasoning (Cobbe et al., 2021), multi-hop reasoning (Geva et al., 2021), and natural language inference\n7. Templates and formatting. For Muffin, T0-SF, and NIV2, we use instructional templates for each task as given by the creators of the mixtures. For CoT, we manually write around ten instruction templates for each of the nine datasets. To create few-shot templates, we write a variety of exemplar delimiters (e.g., \"Q:\"/\"A:\") and apply them randomly at the example level. An example of formatting for both with and without exemplars, as well as with and without CoT, is shown in Figure 3.\n8. Flan-T5 has not been tested in real world applications.\nEthical Considerations & Risks Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. As a result the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases in the underlying data.\n9.

In Section 5, we observed the generality of instruction finetuning by applying it models with a range of different architectures (decoder only, encoder-decoder), sizes (T5-80M to PaLM-540B), and pre-training objectives (causal LM, span corruption, and prefix LM + span corruption). This finding is consistent with prior studies that demonstrated the effectiveness of instruction finetuning on either T5 models (Sanh et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2022c;Scialom et\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nIf the model google/flan-t5-xxl is fine-tuned from another model, provide the name and link to that base model.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/flan-t5-xxl.

{"question": "direct_use", "chain": "retrieval", "prompt": ["The google/flan-t5-xxl model, which is part of the Flan-T5 series, is a large language model that has been pre-trained on a vast amount of text data. One of the key advantages of this model is its ability to perform various natural language processing tasks without the need for fine-tuning.\n\nTo use the google/flan-t5-xxl model without fine-tuning, you can leverage its inherent knowledge and understanding of language patterns. The model can be used for tasks such as:\n\n1. Text generation: Given a prompt or a starting sentence, the model can generate coherent and contextually relevant text.\n\n2. Question answering: The model can provide answers to questions based on the information it has learned during pre-training.\n\n3. Text summarization: By providing the model with a longer piece of text, it can generate a concise summary that captures the main points.\n\n4. Text classification: The model can classify text into predefined categories without additional training.\n\nTo use the model without fine-tuning, you would typically input your text or prompt into the model and let it generate the desired output based on its pre-existing knowledge. This approach is known as \"zero-shot learning,\" where the model relies on its general understanding of language to perform tasks without task-specific training.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the google/flan-t5-xxl model can be used without fine-tuning, the results may not be as accurate or tailored to specific domains compared to models that have undergone fine-tuning on task-specific data. Fine-tuning can help the model adapt to the nuances and requirements of a particular task or domain, leading to improved performance.", "The google/flan-t5-xxl model, which is a large language model trained by Google, can be used without any post-processing due to its ability to generate human-like text based on the given input. This model has been fine-tuned on a diverse range of tasks, allowing it to understand and respond to various prompts without the need for additional processing steps.\n\nTo use the google/flan-t5-xxl model without post-processing, you can simply provide it with a prompt or a question, and the model will generate a relevant and coherent response. The model's architecture and training process enable it to maintain context, understand the intent behind the prompt, and produce an appropriate output that does not require further modification.\n\nFor example, if you ask the model a question like \"What are the main advantages of solar energy?\" it will generate a response that directly answers the question, discussing points such as reduced carbon emissions, lower electricity costs, and energy independence. The generated text will be clear, concise, and ready to use without the need for any post-processing steps.", "The google/flan-t5-xxl model can be used without plugging into a pipeline by directly utilizing the model's tokenizer and model classes from the transformers library. Here's a brief explanation of how to use the model:\n\n1. Install the transformers library:\n   ```\n   pip install transformers\n   ```\n\n2. Import the necessary classes:\n   ```python\n   from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n   ```\n\n3. Load the pre-trained model and tokenizer:\n   ```python\n   model_name = \"google/flan-t5-xxl\"\n   tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n   model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)\n   ```\n\n4. Prepare your input text:\n   ```python\n   input_text = \"Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, how are you?'\"\n   ```\n\n5. Tokenize the input text:\n   ```python\n   input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\n   ```\n\n6. Generate the output:\n   ```python\n   outputs = model.generate(input_ids)\n   ```\n\n7. Decode the generated output:\n   ```python\n   generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n   print(generated_text)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can directly use the google/flan-t5-xxl model for tasks such as translation, summarization, question answering, and more, without the need for a pipeline. This approach provides more flexibility and control over the model's usage.", "The google/flan-t5-xxl model is a large language model developed by Google AI. It is part of the Flan-T5 series, which is fine-tuned on a vast corpus of web pages, books, and articles. The \"xxl\" in the model name indicates that it is an extra-extra-large variant, with 11 billion parameters.\n\nTo use the google/flan-t5-xxl model, you can leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python. Here's a code snippet demonstrating how to load and use the model for text generation:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\n# Load the tokenizer and model\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xxl\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-xxl\")\n\n# Define the input text\ninput_text = \"Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, how are you?'\"\n\n# Tokenize the input text\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\n\n# Generate the output\noutput = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)\n\n# Decode the generated output\ngenerated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\nIn this example, we first load the tokenizer and model using the `from_pretrained()` method from the Transformers library. We then define an input text that instructs the model to translate an English phrase to French.\n\nNext, we tokenize the input text using the loaded tokenizer, which converts the text into input IDs that the model can understand. We pass these input IDs to the model's `generate()` method to generate the output.\n\nFinally, we decode the generated output using the tokenizer's `decode()` method, specifying `skip_special_tokens=True` to remove any special tokens from the generated text.\n\nThe google/flan-t5-xxl model can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and more, by providing appropriate input prompts and instructions."], "answer": ["Sensitive Use Flan-T5 should not be applied for any unacceptable use cases, e.g., generation of abusive speech.", "Answer the following question by reasoning step-by-step.\nAm I blood related to my step-aunt's husband's nephew?

For example, we only use 0.2% of the pre-training compute to instruction-finetune Flan-PaLM 540B (approximately 512 v4 TPU chips for 37 hours).

Task mixtures. Prior literature has shown that increasing the number of tasks in finetuning with instructions improves generalization to unseen tasks (Wei et al., 2021;Sanh et al., 2021, inter alia). In this paper we scale to 1,836 finetuning tasks by combining four mixtures from prior work: Muffin, T0-SF, NIV2, and CoT, as summarized in Figure 2. Muffin 3 (80 tasks) comprises 62 tasks from Wei et al. (2021) and 26 new tasks that we added in this work, including dialog data (Byrne et al., 2019;Anantha et\n2. chosen based on periodic evaluations (every 2k to 10k steps depending the model size) of the held-out tasks, and we used the same number of checkpoint steps across all ablation runs for a given model. Notably, the amount of compute used for finetuning is only a small fraction relative to the training compute, as shown in Table 2. For example, we only use 0.2% of the pre-training compute to instruction-finetune Flan-PaLM 540B (approximately 512 v4 TPU chips for 37 hours). We use the JAX-based T5X framework\n3. In this paper, we apply instruction finetuning across a broad range of model families, including T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and U-PaLM (Tay et al., 2022b). These model families span a range of sizes, from Flan-T5-small (80M parameters), to PaLM and U-PaLM (540B parameters). For each model, we apply the same training procedure, except for a few hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, dropout, and finetuning steps. We use a constant learning rate schedule and finetune using\n4. Chain-of-thought finetuning mixture. The fourth finetuning data mixture (reasoning) involves CoT annotations, which we use to explore whether finetuning on CoT annotations improves performance on unseen reasoning tasks. We create a new mixture of nine datasets from prior work for which human raters manually wrote CoT annotations for a training corpus. These nine datasets include tasks such as arithmetic reasoning (Cobbe et al., 2021), multi-hop reasoning (Geva et al., 2021), and natural language inference\n5. al., 2021;Dai et al., 2022) and program synthesis data (Yasunaga and Liang, 2020;Li et al., 2022). T0-SF (193 tasks) comprises tasks from T0 (Sanh et al., 2021) that do not overlap with the data used in Muffin (SF stands for \"sans Flan\"). NIV2 (1554 tasks) comprises tasks from Wang et al. (2022c). 4 Figure 3: Combinations of finetuning data formats in this work. We finetune with and without exemplars, and also with and without chain-of-thought. In addition, we have some data formats without instructions\n6.

SentencePiece is a subword tokenization algorithm that can handle a large vocabulary efficiently.\n\nThe preprocessing steps for the input data are as follows:\n\n1. Text Normalization: The input text is normalized by converting it to lowercase and removing any unnecessary characters or symbols.\n\n2. Subword Tokenization: The normalized text is then tokenized using the SentencePiece tokenizer. The tokenizer breaks down the text into subword units, which can be individual characters, substrings of characters, or entire words. This allows the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words by combining subword units to form new words.\n\n3. Vocabulary: The SentencePiece tokenizer is trained on a large corpus of text data to create a subword vocabulary. The google/flan-t5-xxl model has a vocabulary size of 32,128 subword tokens.\n\n4.

Special Tokens: The model also uses special tokens to represent specific elements in the input, such as the start and end of a sequence, padding tokens, and sentinel tokens for tasks like text infilling.\n\nThe tokenized input is then fed into the model for training or inference. The model processes the sequence of token IDs and generates an output based on the task at hand. During postprocessing, the generated token IDs are converted back into human-readable text using the SentencePiece tokenizer's decoding functionality.\n\nBy using subword tokenization, the google/flan-t5-xxl model can handle a wide range of vocabulary and effectively process unseen words by breaking them down into subword units.", "The google/flan-t5-xxl model, like other T5 models, operates on textual data and does not require any specific preprocessing steps related to resizing or rewriting. The input data is typically tokenized using the SentencePiece tokenizer, which is a subword tokenization method that can handle a large vocabulary efficiently.\n\nDuring the tokenization process, the input text is split into subword units, which allows the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. The tokenizer used by the google/flan-t5-xxl model has a vocabulary size of 32,128 tokens.\n\nBefore feeding the tokenized input to the model, the input sequence is typically padded or truncated to a fixed length, depending on the maximum sequence length the model can handle.

These results were quite strong for some benchmarks-for example, Flan-T5-XL is only 3B parameters and achieves a MMLU score of 52.4%, surpassing GPT-3 175B's score of 43.9%.   (Ouyang et al., 2022).

To do this, we created an evaluation set of 190 examples. This evaluation set includes questions", "The human rater instructions are given in Appendix I. This ability of instruction-finetuned models to better respond to open-ended zeroshot inputs is consistent with Ouyang et al.

Instruction finetuning improves normalized average performance by a large margin for all model types. For T5 models without instruction finetuning, we use LM-adapted models, which were produced by training T5 on 100B additional tokens from C4 on a standard language modeling objective (Lester et al., 2021).

Notably, the amount of compute used for finetuning is only a small fraction relative to the training compute, as shown in Table 2. For example, we only use 0.2% of the pre-training compute to instruction-finetune Flan-PaLM 540B (approximately 512 v4 TPU chips for 37 hours). We use the JAX-based T5X framework\n2. We found that learning rate, batch size and the dropout were the most important hyperparameters for instruction finetuning. Table 22 lists these values for all finetuned models studied in this paper. The reported batch size is the global batch size (not per-device batch size). Because we use packing (Raffel et al., 2020), the effective batch size is larger.\n3. In this paper, we apply instruction finetuning across a broad range of model families, including T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and U-PaLM (Tay et al., 2022b). These model families span a range of sizes, from Flan-T5-small (80M parameters), to PaLM and U-PaLM (540B parameters). For each model, we apply the same training procedure, except for a few hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, dropout, and finetuning steps. We use a constant learning rate schedule and finetune using\n4. the Adafactor optimizer (Shazeer and Stern, 2018). We use packing (Raffel et al., 2020) to combine multiple training examples into a single sequence, separating inputs from targets using an end-of-sequence token. Masking is applied to prevent the tokens from attending to others across the packed example boundary. The number of finetuning steps, learning rate, batch size, and dropout for each model are given in Appendix E. For each model, we use a single checkpoint for all evaluations; the optimal step was\n5. To run a training job, we use the `t5x/train.py` script.\n\n```sh\n6. For each size PaLM model, we fine tuned an equivalent version of Flan. The largest models, Flan-PaLM and Flan-U-PaLM, have 540 billion parameters. We also have 62-billion and 6-billion parameter models. See Table 2 for details.\n7. Flan-T5-small has 77 million weights. Flan-T5-base has 250 million weights. Flan-T5-large has 780 million weights. Flan-T5-XL has 3 billion weights. Flan-T5-XXL has 11 billion weights. See Table 2 for details.\n8. (Bradbury et al., 2018;.\n9. compared with their non-finetuned models. These results were quite strong for some benchmarks-for example, Flan-T5-XL is only 3B parameters and achieves a MMLU score of 52.4%, surpassing GPT-3 175B's score of 43.9%.   (Ouyang et al., 2022). Hence, we conduct a manual evaluation that investigates the effect of instruction finetuning on the ability for models to give open-ended responses to challenging inputs. To do this, we created an evaluation set of 190 examples. This evaluation set includes questions\n10. The human rater instructions are given in Appendix I. This ability of instruction-finetuned models to better respond to open-ended zeroshot inputs is consistent with Ouyang et al. (2022), which showed that finetuning language models with a set of labeler demonstrations, as well as reinforcement learning from human feedback, improved human evaluations on a user prompt distribution. Moreover, inspection of model generations for PaLM reveals how just pre-training on a next-token prediction objective is not\n11. finetuning requires only 0.2% of the pre-training compute but improves the normalized average across evaluation benchmarks by 9.4%. Moreover, smaller models that use instruction finetuning can sometimes outperform larger models without it. As examples from Table 5, Flan-PaLM 62B outperforms PaLM 540B on TyDiQA (58.7% vs. 52.9% EM), and Flan-T5 11B outperforms PaLM 62B on BBH-direct (43.7% vs. 37.5%).\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide detail training hyperparameters when training the model google/flan-t5-xxl.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/flan-t5-xxl.

Training data: The model was trained on a large corpus of web pages, books, and articles spanning a wide range of domains. This broad training allows it to perform well on many general language tasks, but it may have biases or gaps in more specialized domains that were less represented in the training data.\n\n2. Task formulation: As a text-to-text model, flan-t5-xxl is highly flexible and can be applied to many NLP tasks. However, its performance will depend on how well the task can be formulated as a text-to-text problem and whether the task format aligns with patterns the model learned during training.\n\n3. Language and cultural context: The model has strong English language capabilities but may struggle with nuances or references that are specific to certain regional dialects, cultural contexts, or time periods. Slang, idioms and current events after the model's knowledge cutoff date may be challenging.\n\n4. Domain-specific terminology: While the model has broad knowledge, it may have difficulty with highly technical or esoteric terminology in specialized academic or professional domains. Contexts requiring this level of domain expertise could lead to less reliable outputs.\n\n5. Factual grounding: As a language model, flan-t5-xxl can generate fluent text on many topics but is not grounded to external knowledge sources. Its outputs may contain inconsistencies or inaccuracies, especially for information-dense queries requiring up-to-date factual knowledge.\n\nUnderstanding these characteristics can help set appropriate expectations for the model's capabilities and limitations across different domains and contexts of use. Fine-tuning on domain-specific data can help adapt the model to more specialized applications.", "The behavior of the google/flan-t5-xxl model is likely to be influenced by various population subgroup characteristics, such as:\n\n1. Language: The model's performance may vary depending on the language used in the input data. It is trained on a diverse set of web pages, books, and articles, but its exposure to different languages and dialects may not be equal, potentially leading to biases or variations in output quality.\n\n2. Cultural background: The model's training data encompasses a wide range of cultural contexts. However, the representation of different cultures may not be balanced, which could affect how the model interprets and responds to culturally specific information or nuances.\n\n3. Socioeconomic status: The model's training data may have an overrepresentation of content created by individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, as they are more likely to have access to the internet and contribute to online content. This could lead to biases in the model's understanding and generation of text related to various socioeconomic issues.\n\n4. Education level: The model's behavior may be influenced by the education level of the content creators whose work is included in the training data. This could affect the complexity, style, and accuracy of the model's outputs.\n\n5. Age: The age distribution of content creators in the training data may impact the model's understanding of age-specific language, trends, and perspectives. If certain age groups are underrepresented, the model may struggle to accurately interpret or generate content related to those age groups.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that these potential biases are not inherent to the model itself but rather a reflection of the biases present in the training data. Ongoing research and efforts to create more diverse and representative datasets can help mitigate these biases and improve the model's performance across various population subgroups.", "Based on the available information, it is unclear whether the evaluation of the google/flan-t5-xxl model has been disaggregated across various factors to uncover potential disparities in performance. The model card and associated documentation do not explicitly mention disaggregated evaluation to assess fairness and identify biases.\n\nDisaggregated evaluation involves analyzing a model's performance across different subgroups or factors, such as demographics, protected attributes, or specific domains. This type of evaluation is crucial for uncovering disparities and ensuring that the model performs equitably across different segments of the population or data.\n\nTo comprehensively answer this question, more information would be needed from the model developers or additional research would need to be conducted to determine if any disaggregated evaluation has been performed on the google/flan-t5-xxl model. It is important for model developers to prioritize disaggregated evaluation and transparently report their findings to promote fairness and accountability in AI systems."]}

Addressing this issue involves using diverse and representative training data, as well as implementing techniques to identify and mitigate biases.\n\nThe tradeoff between these errors lies in the fact that optimizing for one type of error may come at the cost of increased vulnerability to another. For example, fine-tuning the model to reduce factual inaccuracies may inadvertently introduce more biases if the fine-tuning data itself contains biases.\n\nUltimately, the choice of which errors to prioritize depends on the specific use case and the potential consequences of each type of error.
