Similar to BERT's [class] token, we prepend a learnable embedding to the sequence of embedded patches (z 0 0 = x class ), whose state at the output of the Transformer encoder (z 0 L ) serves as the image representation y (Eq. 4). Both during pre-training and fine-tuning, a classification head is attached to z 0 L . The classification head is implemented by a MLP with one hidden layer at pre-training time and by a single linear layer at fine-tuning time.\n6. Datasets. To explore model scalability, we use the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset with 1k classes and 1.3M images (we refer to it as ImageNet in what follows), its superset ImageNet-21k with 21k classes and 14M images (Deng et al., 2009), and JFT (Sun et al., 2017) with 18k classes and 303M high-resolution images. We de-duplicate the pre-training datasets w.r.t. the test sets of the downstream tasks following . We transfer the models trained on these dataset to several benchmark tasks: ImageNet on the\n7. For the baseline CNNs, we use ResNet (He et al., 2016), but replace the Batch Normalization layers (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) with Group Normalization (Wu & He, 2018), and used standardized convolutions (Qiao et al., 2019). These modifications improve transfer , and we denote the modified model \"ResNet (BiT)\". For the hybrids, we feed the intermediate feature maps into ViT with patch size of one \"pixel\". To experiment with different sequence lengths, we either (i) take the output of stage 4 of a regular\n8. The \"How to train your ViT? ...\" paper added >50k checkpoints that you can\nfine-tune with the [`configs/augreg.py`] config. When you only specify the model\nname (the `config.name` value from [`configs/model.py`]), then the best i21k\ncheckpoint by upstream validation accuracy (\"recommended\" checkpoint, see\nsection 4.5 of the paper) is chosen. To make up your mind which model you want\nto use, have a look at Figure 3 in the paper. It's also possible to choose a\n9. Typically, we pre-train ViT on large datasets, and fine-tune to (smaller) downstream tasks. For this, we remove the pre-trained prediction head and attach a zero-initialized D \u00d7 K feedforward layer, where K is the number of downstream classes. It is often beneficial to fine-tune at higher resolution than pre-training (Touvron et al., 2019;. When feeding images of higher resolution, we keep the patch size the same, which results in a larger effective sequence length. The Vision Transformer can handle\n10. vanishes for larger models. This result is somewhat surprising, since one might expect convolutional local feature processing to assist ViT at any size. Third, Vision Transformers appear not to saturate within the range tried, motivating future scaling efforts. To begin to understand how the Vision Transformer processes image data, we analyze its internal representations. The first layer of the Vision Transformer linearly projects the flattened patches into a lower-dimensional space (Eq. 1). Figure 7\n11. classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train. 1\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide basic details about the model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k.

This model can be used for various computer vision tasks without the need for fine-tuning in certain scenarios:\n\n1. Feature extraction: The pre-trained model can be used as a feature extractor, where the output of the model's last hidden layer is used as a representation of the input image. These features can then be used for tasks such as image retrieval, clustering, or as input to another machine learning model.\n\n2. Zero-shot learning: Since the model has been trained on a large dataset with a wide variety of classes, it can be used for zero-shot learning. This means that the model can classify images into classes it has not been explicitly trained on, based on the similarity of the image features to the learned representations of the known classes.\n\n3. Similarity search: The model's learned representations can be used to find similar images in a large dataset. By comparing the cosine similarity or other distance metrics between the features of a query image and the features of images in a database, the most similar images can be retrieved.\n\nHowever, for best performance on specific tasks, it is generally recommended to fine-tune the pre-trained model using a smaller dataset relevant to the target task. This allows the model to adapt its learned representations to the specific characteristics and nuances of the target domain.", "The model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k is a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) that can be used for various computer vision tasks without the need for extensive post-processing. This model has been trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which contains 21,000 classes and millions of images, allowing it to learn a wide range of visual features and representations.\n\nOne of the key advantages of using this model is its ability to generate high-quality feature embeddings directly from input images. These embeddings can be used as input for downstream tasks such as image classification, object detection, or image retrieval without requiring additional post-processing steps. By simply passing an image through the model, you can obtain a dense vector representation that captures the essential features and semantics of the image.\n\nTo use the model without post-processing, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Load the pre-trained model using a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n2. Preprocess your input image by resizing it to the required input size (224x224 pixels) and normalizing the pixel values.\n3. Pass the preprocessed image through the model to obtain the feature embeddings.\n4. Use the generated embeddings as input for your desired downstream task, such as training a classifier or performing similarity-based image retrieval.\n\nBy leveraging the rich feature representations learned by the google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model, you can achieve competitive performance on various computer vision tasks without the need for extensive post-processing or fine-tuning. This makes the model a valuable tool for quickly prototyping and deploying vision-based applications.", "The google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model is a Vision Transformer (ViT) model that can be used for various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, without necessarily plugging it into a pipeline. To use this model directly, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Load the pre-trained model using the AutoModel class from the transformers library.\n2. Preprocess your input image by resizing it to the required dimensions (224x224) and normalizing the pixel values.\n3. Convert the preprocessed image to a tensor and add a batch dimension.\n4. Pass the input tensor through the model to obtain the output embeddings.\n5. Use the output embeddings for your desired task, such as feeding them into a classifier or using them for similarity comparison.\n\nBy following these steps, you can leverage the power of the pre-trained ViT model to extract meaningful features from images and use them for various computer vision applications without the need for a pipeline. This approach allows for more flexibility and customization in how you utilize the model's capabilities.", "The model \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" is a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pretrained by Google on the ImageNet-21k dataset. It can be used for various computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.\n\nTo use this model, you can leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python. Here's a code snippet demonstrating how to load the model and perform image classification:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import ViTFeatureExtractor, ViTForImageClassification\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\n# Load the pretrained model and feature extractor\nmodel = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained(\"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\")\nfeature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\")\n\n# Load and preprocess the image\nurl = \"https://example.com/image.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Perform image classification\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\npredicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()\nprint(\"Predicted class index:\", predicted_class_idx)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n1. We import the necessary classes from the Transformers library and other required libraries.\n2. We load the pretrained ViT model and its corresponding feature extractor using the `from_pretrained()` method.\n3. We load an image from a URL using the `requests` library and preprocess it using the feature extractor. The `return_tensors=\"pt\"` argument ensures that the preprocessed image is returned as a PyTorch tensor.\n4. We pass the preprocessed image to the model and obtain the output logits.\n5. We find the index of the predicted class by taking the argmax of the logits tensor.\n\nNote that the model expects the input image to be of size 224x224 pixels. If your image has a different size, you may need to resize it before passing it to the feature extractor.\n\nThis is just a basic example of how to use the \"google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k\" model for image classification. You can explore other tasks and fine-tune the model on your specific dataset to achieve better performance."]}

Depending on the application, misclassifications could be very harmful, for example in medical diagnosis use cases.\n\n- Opaque \"black box\" - The inner workings of large neural networks can be difficult to interpret and explain. This opacity makes auditing for issues like unfair bias more challenging.\n\nHowever, without more specifics on the model details and intended use cases, it's hard to comprehensively assess harms and limitations.

While it has demonstrated impressive performance on various computer vision tasks, there are some potential misunderstandings and limitations to consider:\n\n1. Generalization: Although the model is trained on a diverse dataset, it may not generalize well to all domains or specific tasks. The performance on ImageNet-21k does not guarantee similar performance on other datasets or real-world applications.\n\n2. Bias: The model may inherit biases present in the training data, such as cultural, gender, or racial biases. These biases can lead to unfair or inaccurate predictions in certain scenarios.\n\n3. Adversarial examples: Like other deep learning models, ViT models can be vulnerable to adversarial examples\u2014carefully crafted input images designed to fool the model into making incorrect predictions.\n\n4. Interpretability: The decision-making process of the model can be difficult to interpret, as it relies on self-attention mechanisms and complex interactions between image patches. This lack of interpretability can make it challenging to understand why the model makes certain predictions.\n\n5. Computational resources: The google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model is a large model with many parameters, requiring significant computational resources for inference.

Computational requirements: The model is large, with approximately 307 million parameters, which requires significant computational resources for fine-tuning and inference. This can limit its usability on resource-constrained devices or in real-time applications.\n\n2. Transfer learning performance: While the model has been pre-trained on a large dataset (ImageNet-21k), its performance on specific downstream tasks may vary depending on the similarity between the pre-training and target datasets. Fine-tuning the model on a smaller, domain-specific dataset might not always yield optimal results.\n\n3. Robustness to adversarial attacks: Like other deep learning models, ViT models can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted perturbations to input images can cause misclassifications. More research is needed to improve the robustness of these models against such attacks.\n\n4. Interpretability: The self-attention mechanism in ViT models can make it challenging to interpret the model's decisions and understand which parts of the input image contribute to the output. This lack of interpretability can be a limitation in applications where explainability is crucial, such as in medical diagnosis or autonomous vehicles.\n\n5. Handling occlusions and truncations: ViT models may struggle with images containing occlusions or truncated objects, as the self-attention mechanism relies on the global context of the image. Improving the model's ability to handle such cases is an ongoing research area.\n\n6. Bias and fairness: Like other machine learning models, ViT models can inherit biases present in the training data, which may lead to unfair or discriminatory predictions.

Applicability to other vision tasks: While the ViT model shows promising results on image classification, its performance on other computer vision tasks like detection and segmentation still needs to be explored and validated. [Reference 1]\n\n2. Self-supervised pre-training: Although self-supervised pre-training improves the model's performance, there is still a significant gap compared to large-scale supervised pre-training. Further research is needed to bridge this gap and improve self-supervised methods for the ViT model. [Reference 2]\n\n3. Scaling and computational resources: Scaling up the ViT model is likely to lead to improved performance. However, this may require significant computational resources, which could be a limiting factor for some users or applications. [Reference 3, 4]\n\n4. Inductive bias: Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the ViT model has much less image-specific inductive bias. While this allows for more flexibility, it may also lead to less efficient learning on smaller datasets or tasks that benefit from strong inductive biases. [Reference 7]\n\n5.

The preprocessing steps for the input data are as follows:\n\n1. Resizing: The input images are resized to a fixed size of 224x224 pixels. This ensures that all images have consistent dimensions before being fed into the model.\n\n2. Patch Extraction: The resized image is divided into non-overlapping patches of size 16x16 pixels. In this case, with an image size of 224x224 and a patch size of 16x16, there will be a total of 14x14 = 196 patches.\n\n3. Patch Flattening: Each 16x16 patch is flattened into a 1D vector of size 256 (16 * 16 = 256). This step converts the 2D spatial structure of the patches into a 1D sequence of tokens.\n\n4. Patch Embedding: The flattened patches are then linearly projected into a higher-dimensional space using a learned embedding matrix. In the case of the vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model, the embedding dimension is typically set to 1024.\n\n5. Position Embeddings: To preserve the spatial information of the patches, learnable position embeddings are added to the patch embeddings. These position embeddings encode the relative position of each patch within the image.\n\n6. Input Sequence: The resulting sequence of embedded patches, along with the position embeddings, forms the input sequence to the Vision Transformer model. This sequence is then processed by the self-attention layers and feed-forward networks of the Transformer architecture.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific details of the preprocessing steps may vary depending on the implementation and framework being used. However, the general idea of resizing, patch extraction, flattening, and embedding remains consistent across different ViT models.", "The google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model is a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on the ImageNet-21k dataset. As the model name suggests, it uses a patch size of 16x16 and expects input images to be resized to 224x224 pixels.\n\nPreprocessing for this model involves the following steps:\n\n1. Resize the input image: The input image is resized to a fixed size of 224x224 pixels using bilinear interpolation. This ensures that all images have consistent dimensions before being fed into the model.\n\n2. Normalize pixel values: The pixel values of the resized image are normalized to a range of [-1, 1]. This is typically done by subtracting the mean pixel value (0.5) and dividing by the standard deviation (0.5) for each color channel (red, green, and blue).\n\n3.

We train all models, including ResNets, using Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) with \u03b2 1 = 0.9, \u03b2 2 = 0.999, a batch size of 4096 and apply a high weight decay of 0.1, which we found to be useful for transfer of all models (Appendix D.1 shows that, in contrast to common practices, Adam works slightly better than SGD for ResNets in our setting). We use a linear learning rate warmup and decay, see Appendix B.1 for details. For fine-tuning we use SGD with momentum, batch size 512, for all\n3. Datasets. To explore model scalability, we use the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset with 1k classes and 1.3M images (we refer to it as ImageNet in what follows), its superset ImageNet-21k with 21k classes and 14M images (Deng et al., 2009), and JFT (Sun et al., 2017) with 18k classes and 303M high-resolution images. We de-duplicate the pre-training datasets w.r.t. the test sets of the downstream tasks following . We transfer the models trained on these dataset to several benchmark tasks: ImageNet on the\n4. original validation labels and the cleaned-up ReaL labels , CIFAR-10/100 (Krizhevsky, 2009), Oxford-IIIT Pets (Parkhi et al., 2012), and Oxford Flowers-102 (Nilsback & Zisserman, 2008). For these datasets, pre-processing follows .  We also evaluate on the 19-task VTAB classification suite (Zhai et al., 2019b). VTAB evaluates low-data transfer to diverse tasks, using 1 000 training examples per task. The tasks are divided into three groups: Natural -tasks like the above, Pets, CIFAR, etc. Specialized\n5. For VTAB we follow the protocol in , and use the same hyperparameter setting for all tasks. We use a learning rate of 0.01 and train for 2500 steps (Tab. 4). We chose this setting by running a small sweep over two learning rates and two schedules, and selecting the setting with the highest VTAB score on the 200-example validation sets. We follow the pre-processing used in , except that we do not use task-specific input resolutions. Instead we find that Vision Transformer benefits most from a high\n6. Model Variants. We base ViT configurations on those used for BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), as summarized in Table 1. The \"Base\" and \"Large\" models are directly adopted from BERT and we add the larger \"Huge\" model. In what follows we use brief notation to indicate the model size and the input patch size: for instance, ViT-L/16 means the \"Large\" variant with 16 \u00d7 16 input patch size.\n7. Lastly, we would like to remark that our instantiation of masked patch prediction doesn't require such an enormous amount of pretraining nor a large dataset such as JFT in order to lead to similar performance gains on ImageNet classification. That is, we observed diminishing returns on downstream performance after 100k pretraining steps, and see similar gains when pretraining on ImageNet.\n8. For the baseline CNNs, we use ResNet (He et al., 2016), but replace the Batch Normalization layers (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) with Group Normalization (Wu & He, 2018), and used standardized convolutions (Qiao et al., 2019). These modifications improve transfer , and we denote the modified model \"ResNet (BiT)\". For the hybrids, we feed the intermediate feature maps into ViT with patch size of one \"pixel\". To experiment with different sequence lengths, we either (i) take the output of stage 4 of a regular\n9. subsets and use the same hyper-parameters for all settings. This way, we assess the intrinsic model properties, and not the effect of regularization. We do, however, use early-stopping, and report the best validation accuracy achieved during training. To save compute, we report few-shot linear accuracy instead of full finetuning accuracy. Figure 4 contains the results. Vision Transformers overfit more than ResNets with comparable computational cost on smaller datasets. For example, ViT-B/32 is slightly\n10. First, we pre-train ViT models on datasets of increasing size: ImageNet, ImageNet-21k, and JFT-300M. To boost the performance on the smaller datasets, we optimize three basic regularization parameters -weight decay, dropout, and label smoothing. Figure 3 shows the results after finetuning to ImageNet (results on other datasets are shown in    Second, we train our models on random subsets of 9M, 30M, and 90M as well as the full JFT-300M dataset. We do not perform additional regularization on the smaller\n11. pre-training efficiency may be affected not only by the architecture choice, but also other parameters, such as training schedule, optimizer, weight decay, etc. We provide a controlled study of performance vs. compute for different architectures in Section 4.4. Finally, the ViT-L/16 model pre-trained on the public ImageNet-21k dataset performs well on most datasets too, while taking fewer resources to pre-train: it could be trained using a standard cloud TPUv3 with 8 cores in approximately 30 days.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide detail training hyperparameters when training the model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k.

Image resolution: The model is trained on images with a resolution of 224x224 pixels. Images with significantly different resolutions may affect the model's performance.\n\n2. Image content: The ImageNet-21k dataset consists of a wide range of image categories, including objects, scenes, and abstract concepts. The model is likely to perform better on images that are similar to those in the training dataset.\n\n3. Domain shift: If the model is applied to images from domains that are significantly different from the ImageNet-21k dataset (e.g., medical images, satellite imagery), its performance may degrade due to domain shift.\n\n4. Fine-tuning: The model's behavior can be adapted to specific tasks or domains through fine-tuning on task-specific datasets. The characteristics of the fine-tuning dataset will influence the model's performance on the target task.\n\n5. Patch size: The model uses a patch size of 16x16 pixels. This patch size affects the model's ability to capture local and global features in the image. Changing the patch size may impact the model's performance.\n\n6. Computational resources: The google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model is a large model with many parameters. Its performance and inference time will be influenced by the available computational resources, such as GPU memory and processing power.\n\nUnderstanding these domain and context characteristics is crucial for effectively applying the google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model to various computer vision tasks and ensuring optimal performance.", "The model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k, being a vision transformer model trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, may exhibit biases and variations in performance based on certain population subgroup characteristics present in the training data. Some foreseeable characteristics that could influence the model's behavior include:\n\n1. Ethnicity and skin tone: The model's performance might vary depending on the diversity and representation of different ethnicities and skin tones in the training data. If certain ethnicities or skin tones are underrepresented, the model may struggle to accurately classify or process images containing individuals from those groups.\n\n2. Age: The model's ability to recognize and process images of people from different age groups may be influenced by the age distribution in the training data. If the dataset predominantly features a specific age range, the model might perform better on images containing individuals within that range and less accurately on images of people from other age groups.\n\n3. Gender: Gender representation in the training data can impact the model's performance. If the dataset has an imbalance in gender representation, the model may develop biases or varying levels of accuracy when processing images of different genders.\n\n4. Cultural and geographic diversity: The model's behavior can be influenced by the cultural and geographic diversity present in the training data. If the dataset is skewed towards certain cultural or geographic backgrounds, the model may perform better on images that align with those backgrounds and less accurately on images from underrepresented cultures or regions.\n\nIt is important to note that these biases and variations in performance are not inherent to the model architecture itself but rather a reflection of the biases and limitations present in the training data. Efforts to create more diverse and representative datasets, as well as techniques like data augmentation and bias mitigation strategies, can help address these issues and improve the model's fairness and generalizability across different population subgroups.", "Based on the available information about the google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model, there is no clear indication that the evaluation of the model's performance has been disaggregated across various factors to uncover potential disparities. The model card and documentation primarily focus on the architecture, training data, and overall performance metrics, such as accuracy on benchmark datasets like ImageNet-21k and ImageNet-1k.\n\nTo comprehensively assess whether the model exhibits disparities in performance, it would be necessary to evaluate its performance across different subgroups or factors, such as race, gender, age, or other demographic characteristics.

Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the Vision Transformer (ViT) model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k, here are some foreseeable characteristics that may influence its behavior:\n\nDataset Size and Domain:\nThe performance of the ViT model is heavily influenced by the size and domain of the pre-training dataset. References 1, 2, and 5 indicate that ViT models benefit from larger datasets like ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M compared to smaller datasets like ImageNet. The model's performance on downstream tasks will likely vary depending on the similarity between the pre-training data domain and the target domain.\n\nComputational Cost and Model Size: \nReferences 4 and 7 suggest that the computational cost of pre-training and the model size impact ViT's performance. Larger ViT models tend to perform better but require more compute resources for pre-training. The ViT-L/16 model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k shows good performance while being more computationally efficient.\n\nFine-tuning Resolution:\nReference 3 mentions that fine-tuning ViT at a higher resolution than the pre-training resolution can be beneficial. The patch size remains the same, resulting in a larger effective sequence length. This suggests that the model's performance may vary based on the resolution used during fine-tuning.\n\n[More Information Needed] regarding specific population subgroups or factors for disaggregated evaluation, as the provided references do not cover this aspect in detail.\n\nIn summary, the pre-training dataset size and domain, computational cost, model size, and fine-tuning resolution are key characteristics that influence the behavior of the google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model. More information is needed to assess potential disparities in performance across different population subgroups or factors."}

The key components of the model architecture are as follows:\n\n1. Patch Embedding: The input image is divided into non-overlapping patches of size 16x16 pixels. Each patch is linearly projected into a lower-dimensional embedding space.\n\n2. Positional Embeddings: Since the Transformer architecture is permutation-invariant, positional embeddings are added to the patch embeddings to retain spatial information.\n\n3. Transformer Encoder: The embedded patches are passed through a stack of Transformer encoder layers. Each layer consists of a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network (MLP). The self-attention mechanism allows the model to capture global dependencies between patches.\n\n4. Classification Head: The output of the Transformer encoder is passed through a classification head, which typically consists of a global average pooling layer followed by a fully connected layer. The classification head outputs the final predictions for the task at hand.\n\nThe \"large\" in the model name indicates that it has a larger number of Transformer layers and hidden dimensions compared to the base ViT model. The model is pretrained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which contains 21,841 classes and 14 million images, providing a strong foundation for transfer learning to various downstream vision tasks.", "The objective of the model google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k is to perform image classification tasks on a wide range of visual concepts. This model is a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture pre-trained on the ImageNet-21k dataset, which contains 21,841 classes and 14 million images.\n\nThe model aims to learn rich visual representations by attending to different patches of the input image and capturing their relationships.
