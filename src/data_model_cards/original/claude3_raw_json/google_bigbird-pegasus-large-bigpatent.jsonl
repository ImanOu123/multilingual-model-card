It utilizes a combination of global attention, random attention, and local attention to reduce the quadratic dependency on sequence length.\n\nKey features of the BigBird architecture include:\n\n1. Sparse attention: BigBird uses a sparse attention mechanism that attends to a subset of tokens rather than all tokens, reducing computational complexity.\n\n2. Global, random, and local attention: The model employs a combination of global attention (attending to all tokens), random attention (attending to randomly selected tokens), and local attention (attending to nearby tokens within a fixed window size).\n\n3. Longer sequence handling: BigBird can process sequences up to 4096 tokens, making it suitable for tasks involving longer documents.\n\nThe google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model is further enhanced by using the PEGASUS (Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive SUmmarization Sequence-to-sequence) pre-training objective. PEGASUS is an abstractive summarization model that is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data with the objective of generating summary-like text from input documents.\n\nIn summary, the google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model combines the strengths of the BigBird architecture for handling longer sequences and the PEGASUS pre-training objective for abstractive summarization, making it well-suited for tasks involving long documents, such as patent data.", "The google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model is a large language model developed by Google. It was trained on a dataset of 1.5 million US patents across a wide range of technical domains. The model architecture combines Google's BigBird transformer model, which allows capturing long-range dependencies in text, with the PEGASUS abstractive summarization approach. This enables the model to understand and generate coherent summaries and paraphrases of lengthy, complex technical content like patents. The model was trained in an unsupervised manner on the patent corpus using a self-supervised pre-training objective. Fine-tuning can adapt the model for specific downstream tasks like patent classification or claim generation.", "The google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model is a large language model developed by Google. It is based on the BigBird architecture, which is designed to handle longer input sequences efficiently, combined with the PEGASUS (Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive SUmmarization) pre-training objective.\n\nKey details about the model parameters:\n\n1. Architecture: The model uses the BigBird transformer architecture, which employs sparse attention mechanisms to process longer sequences while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n2. Pre-training: The model is pre-trained using the PEGASUS objective, which involves masking important sentences from input documents and training the model to generate these sentences as a summary.\n\n3. Model size: The \"large\" in the model name indicates that it is a large-scale model. However, the exact number of parameters is not readily available in the official documentation.\n\n4. Training data: The model is trained on the BigPatent dataset, which consists of 1.3 million U.S. patent documents spanning various technical domains. This allows the model to have a broad understanding of technical language and concepts.\n\n5. Input sequence length: BigBird models can handle longer input sequences compared to traditional transformer models. The maximum input sequence length for this model is likely to be in the range of several thousand tokens.\n\nPlease note that without access to the official model card or research paper, providing the exact number of parameters or hidden layers is difficult.

While it can generate text related to patents and intellectual property, it is important to note several key disclaimers:\n\n1. The model's outputs do not constitute legal advice. Any information generated should be reviewed by qualified patent attorneys or agents before being relied upon or used for any legal purpose.\n\n2. The model may produce incorrect, inconsistent or biased information. Its outputs are based on statistical patterns in the training data and are not guaranteed to be factual, complete or up-to-date. \n\n3. The model does not have true understanding and cannot engage in substantive discussions about patents or IP. It simply generates text based on patterns and cannot reason about the subject matter.\n\n4. Use of the model must comply with its intended use case and license. It is not intended for making actual patent filings or providing legal guidance to be acted upon without expert review.\n\nIn summary, while this powerful AI model can produce patent-related text, it is critical that its significant limitations be understood and that reliance on its raw outputs be avoided for any legal or IP matters. Expert oversight and review of the model's generations are essential."]}

The tokenizer is responsible for preprocessing the input text, converting it into a format that the model can understand. The model class, on the other hand, contains the actual pre-trained weights and performs the inference.\n\nOnce you have the tokenizer and model instances, you can tokenize your input text using the tokenizer.

This task involves predicting a random subset of tokens which have been masked out. We use four standard data-sets for pretraining (listed in App. E.1, Tab. 9), warm-starting from the public RoBERTa checkpoint 2 . We compare performance in predicting the masked out tokens in terms of bits per character, following [8]. As seen in App. E.1, Tab. 10, both BIGBIRD and Longformer perform\n2. long document classification where discriminating information may not be located in first 512 tokens. Below we summarize the results for BIGBIRD using sequence length 4096 1 , while we defer all other setup details including computational resources, batch size, step size, to App. E.\n3. better than limited length RoBERTa, with BIGBIRD-ETC performing the best. We note that we trained our models on a reasonable 16GB memory/chip with batch size of 32-64. Our memory efficiency is due to efficient blocking and sparsity structure of the sparse attention mechanism described in Sec. 2.\n4. To directly use the encoder instead of say BERT model, we can use the following\ncode.\n\n```python\nfrom bigbird.core import modeling\n\nbigb_encoder = modeling.BertModel(...)\n```\n\nIt can easily replace [BERT's](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) encoder.\n\n\nAlternatively, one can also try playing with layers of BigBird encoder\n\n```python\nfrom bigbird.core import encoder\n\nonly_layers = encoder.EncoderStack(...)\n```\n5. In this section our goal is to showcase benefits of modeling longer input sequence for NLP tasks, for which we select three representative tasks. We begin with basic masked language modeling (MLM; Devlin et al. 22) to check if better contextual representations can be learnt by utilizing longer contiguous sequences. Next, we consider QA with supporting evidence, for which capability to handle longer sequence would allow us to retrieve more evidence using crude systems like TF-IDF/BM25.   Finally, we tackle\n6. DNA into tokens so as to further increase the context length (App. F, Fig. 7). In particular, we build a byte-pair encoding [50] 4 . We finetuned the pretrained BIGBIRD model from above, using the training data and report F1 on test dataset. We compare our results to the previously reported best method in Tab. 6. We see that BIGBIRD achieve nearly perfect accuracy with a 5% jump from the previous best reported accuracy.   [109,46]. Thus, understanding the functional effects of non-coding regions of DNA is\n7. There has been a recent upsurge in using deep learning for genomics data [86,106,13], which has resulted in improved performance on several biologically-significant tasks such as promoter site prediction [71], methylation analysis [55], predicting functional effects of non-coding variant [109], etc. These approaches consume DNA sequence fragments as inputs, and therefore we believe longer input sequence handling capability of BIGBIRD would be beneficial as many functional effects in DNA are highly non-local\n8. [12]. Furthermore, taking inspiration from NLP, we learn powerful contextual representations for DNA fragments utilizing abundant unlabeled data (e.g. human reference genome, Saccharomyces Genome Database) via MLM pretraining. Next, we showcase that our long input BIGBIRD along with the proposed pretraining significantly improves performances in two downstream tasks. Detailed experimental setup for the two tasks are provided in App. F.   [58], instead of operating on base pairs, we propose to first segment\n9. Classification We experiment on datasets of different lengths and contents, specifically various document classification and GLUE tasks. Following BERT, we used one layer with cross entropy loss on top of the first [CLS] token. We see that gains of using BIGBIRD are more significant when we have longer documents and fewer training examples. For instance, using base sized model, BIGBIRD improves state-of-the-art for Arxiv dataset by about 5% points. On Patents dataset, there is improvement over using simple\n10. - pretrained Pegasus Encoder-Decoder Transformer in large size(`bigbp_large`). Again following original implementation of Pegasus, they are transformers with pre-normalization. They have full set of separate encoder-decoder weights. Also for long document summarization datasets, we have converted Pegasus checkpoints (`model.ckpt-0`) for each dataset and also provided fine-tuned checkpoints (`model.ckpt-300000`) which works on longer documents.\n11. As has been pointed out recently [76,107], pretraining helps in generative tasks, we warm start from our general purpose MLM pretraining on base-sized models as well as utilizing state-of-the-art summarization specific pretraining from Pegasus [107] on large-sized models. The results of training BIGBIRD sparse encoder along with full decoder on these long document datasets are presented in Tab. 4. We can clearly see modeling longer context brings significant improvement. Along with hyperparameters, we also\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nExplain how this model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent can be used when fine-tuned for a task or when plugged into a larger ecosystem or app. Provide a code snippet if necessary\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.

For instance, using base sized model, BIGBIRD improves state-of-the-art for Arxiv dataset by about 5% points. On Patents dataset, there is improvement over using simple\n8. We use four publicly available datasets Books [110], CC-News [34], Stories [89] and Wikipedia to pretrain BIGBIRD. We borrow the sentencepiece vocabulary as RoBERTa (which is in turn borrowed from GPT2). We split any document longer than 4096 into multiple documents and we join documents that were much smaller than 4096. Following the original BERT training, we mask 15% of tokens in these four datasets, and train to predict the mask. We warm start from RoBERTa's checkpoint. We train two different models:\n9. We prefix and append each example with [CLS] and [SEP] token respectively. The output corresponding to the [CLS] token from BIGBIRD transformer encoder is fed to a simple binary classification layer. We fine-tune the pretrained BIGBIRD from App. F.1 using hyper-parameters described in Tab. 21. We note that high performance is not surprising due to the overlap in the nature of negative example generation and MLM pretraining.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nHow the model may foreseeably be misused and address what users ought not do with the model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.

This could be misleading if generated text is presented as factual.\n\nEnabling bad actors to more easily file fraudulent or frivolous patents by automating the authoring of technical patent language and claims.

Its outputs should not be blindly trusted as authoritative.\n\n- The training data consists of patents, which have their own unique style, jargon, and subject matter.

{"question": "bias_recommendations", "chain": "rev_retrieval", "prompt": ["When considering the potential issues with the google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model, a few key points come to mind:\n\n1. Bias: As with any large language model trained on a specific domain (in this case, patent data), there is a risk of the model inheriting biases present in the training data. This could lead to the model generating content that favors certain types of patents, technologies, or industries over others.\n\n2. Limited generalization: While the model is likely to perform well on tasks related to patent data, its performance may not generalize well to other domains or tasks that are significantly different from the training data. This could limit the model's applicability in broader contexts.\n\n3. Computational resources: The \"large\" in the model's name suggests that it is a sizable model, which may require significant computational resources to run effectively. This could pose challenges for users with limited access to high-performance computing infrastructure.\n\n4. Intellectual property concerns: Given that the model is trained on patent data, there may be concerns around the model potentially reproducing or generating content that infringes upon existing patents. This could lead to legal and ethical issues if not properly addressed.\n\n5. Lack of interpretability: Like many deep learning models, the google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model may suffer from a lack of interpretability. This means that it might be difficult to understand how the model arrives at its outputs, which could be problematic in contexts where explainability is important, such as in legal or regulatory settings.", "Based on the limited information provided about the google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model, here are some general recommendations regarding potential issues to consider:\n\n1. Bias and fairness: Large language models can sometimes exhibit biases present in their training data. It's important to evaluate the model's outputs for any potential biases related to gender, race, or other sensitive attributes. Mitigation strategies may be needed.\n\n2. Hallucinations: Language models can occasionally generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect statements. Use the model's outputs with caution, especially for critical applications. Outputs should be fact-checked against reliable sources.\n\n3. Intellectual property: Since the model was likely trained on patent data, be mindful of potential intellectual property issues. Generated text could inadvertently reproduce patented language. Consult with legal experts regarding the model's appropriate use cases.\n\n4. Misuse and ethical concerns: As with any powerful language model, there are risks of misuse such as generating misleading or harmful content. Establish clear guidelines and restrictions for appropriate use of the model. Consider potential ethical implications.\n\n5. Domain shift: The model's performance may degrade if applied to patent data that is substantially different from its training domain, such as patents from other languages or technical fields. Evaluate the model's generalization capabilities.\n\n6. Computational resources: Large models like this often require significant computational resources for inference. Ensure you have adequate infrastructure for your use case.

Performance-memory tradeoff: While BigBird reduces memory consumption compared to other long-range transformers without sacrificing performance (Ref 1), it's important to assess if this tradeoff is suitable for the specific use case of the bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model. \n\n2. Limitations on certain tasks: The references show that sparse attention mechanisms like BigBird's cannot universally replace dense attention for all tasks. There exist problems solvable in O(1) layers by full attention that would require \u03a9(n) layers for sparse attention with \u00d5(n) edges (Ref 2-5). It's crucial to evaluate if the bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model's intended applications fall under this limitation.\n\n3. Need for regularization: Reference 8 mentions that additional regularization was needed when training BigBird for certain competitive tasks. [More Information Needed] on whether such regularization was used for bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent and its impact.\n\n4. Pretraining data: The bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model should document what pretraining data was used (Ref 9 mentions Books, CC-News, Stories, Wikipedia for the original BigBird). Any potential biases or limitations from the pretraining data sources should be analyzed and communicated to users.\n\n5. Evaluation on long sequences: As BigBird is designed for longer sequences, the bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model should be thoroughly evaluated on patent documents of various lengths to understand its performance characteristics and limitations.\n\nIn summary, while BigBird enables handling longer sequences, the bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model card should clearly communicate its performance tradeoffs, potential limitations on certain tasks, any important training details, pretraining data used, and extensive evaluation results to help users determine if it suits their use case.

In this section we provide details of the experimental setup for BIGBIRD on genomics data.\n3. \u2022 Masked Language Model (MLM): In order to train a deep bidirectional representation, BERT training introduces the MLM task, where we simply mask out 15% of the input tokens at random, and then predict those masked tokens. We can simply replace such masked out of the tokens with a [MASK] placeholder, but it leads to a distribution mis-match for downstream tasks which will not have such placeholders. To mitigate with this issue, out of the 15% of the tokens selected for masking:\n4. Next we run sentencepiece [50] tokenization on the resulting documents. In particular, using 5 characters as the building blocks (four for bases -A, T, C, G and one for missing symbol N), we construct a byte pair encoding table of size 32k, with each token representing 8.78 base pairs on average.\nUsing the above constructed documents, we construct a dataset for two pretraining tasks following Devlin et al.

Each document d \u2208 D is a sequence of sentences, where each sentence is a sequence of fragments of DNA. We construct the documents as follows:\n6. As a result we propose to first blockify the attention pattern i.e. we pack sets of query and keys together and then define attention on these blocks. It is easier to explain this process using the example shown in Fig. 3. Suppose, there are 12 query and 12 key vectors to attend to. Using a block size of 2, we split the query matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks and similarly the key matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks. Then the three different building components of BIGBIRD are defined on the block matrix. In particular\n7. We use four publicly available datasets Books [110], CC-News [34], Stories [89] and Wikipedia to pretrain BIGBIRD. We borrow the sentencepiece vocabulary as RoBERTa (which is in turn borrowed from GPT2).

It means that each query block j (size 2 queries) attends to key block j \u2212 1, j, j + 1.\n5. GPU/TPU and Sparsity Ideally, if the adjacency matrix A described in Sec. 2 is sparse, one would hope this would be sufficient to speed up the implementation. Unfortunately, it is well known [33,102], that such sparse multiplications cannot be efficiently implemented in GPUs. GPUs have thousands of cores performing operations in parallel. Thus, we cannot efficiently perform the sparse matrix multiplication mentioned in section Sec. 2.\n6. 1. Random attention: Each query block attends to r random key blocks. In Fig. 3a, r = 1 with block size 2. This implies that each query block of size 2 randomly attends to a key block of size 2.\n7. - pretrained Pegasus Encoder-Decoder Transformer in large size(`bigbp_large`). Again following original implementation of Pegasus, they are transformers with pre-normalization. They have full set of separate encoder-decoder weights. Also for long document summarization datasets, we have converted Pegasus checkpoints (`model.ckpt-0`) for each dataset and also provided fine-tuned checkpoints (`model.ckpt-300000`) which works on longer documents.\n8. We use four publicly available datasets Books [110], CC-News [34], Stories [89] and Wikipedia to pretrain BIGBIRD. We borrow the sentencepiece vocabulary as RoBERTa (which is in turn borrowed from GPT2). We split any document longer than 4096 into multiple documents and we join documents that were much smaller than 4096. Following the original BERT training, we mask 15% of tokens in these four datasets, and train to predict the mask. We warm start from RoBERTa's checkpoint. We train two different models:\n9. We prefix and append each example with [CLS] and [SEP] token respectively. The output corresponding to the [CLS] token from BIGBIRD transformer encoder is fed to a simple binary classification layer. We fine-tune the pretrained BIGBIRD from App. F.1 using hyper-parameters described in Tab. 21. We note that high performance is not surprising due to the overlap in the nature of negative example generation and MLM pretraining.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide detail tokenization, resizing/rewriting (depending on the modality), etc. about the preprocessing for the data of the model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.

Using a block size of 2, we split the query matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks and similarly the key matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks. Then the three different building components of BIGBIRD are defined on the block matrix. In particular\n3. We optimize the code for modern hardware. Hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs truly shine on coalesced memory operations which load blocks of contiguous bytes at once. Thus, its not very efficient to have small sporadic look-ups caused by a sliding window or random element queries. We alleviate this by \"blockifying\" the lookups.\n4. GPU/TPU and Sparsity Ideally, if the adjacency matrix A described in Sec. 2 is sparse, one would hope this would be sufficient to speed up the implementation. Unfortunately, it is well known [33,102], that such sparse multiplications cannot be efficiently implemented in GPUs. GPUs have thousands of cores performing operations in parallel. Thus, we cannot efficiently perform the sparse matrix multiplication mentioned in section Sec. 2.\n5. 2. Window local attention: While creating the block, we ensure that the number of query blocks and the number of key blocks are the same. This helps us in defining the block window attention. Every query block with index j attends to key block with index j \u2212 (w \u2212 1)/2 to j + (w \u2212 1)/2, including key block j. In Fig. 3b, w = 3 with block size 2. It means that each query block j (size 2 queries) attends to key block j \u2212 1, j, j + 1.\n6. The detailed statistics of the four datasets used are given in Tab. 11. All the hyperparameters for BIGBIRD, used for creating Tab. 2 are shown in Tab. 12 and those submitted to get Tab. 3 are shown in Tab. 13. We use two types of regularization in training:\n\u2022 We used a variant of contrastive predictive coding [70] as a dual encoder model.\n\u2022 We use position embedding for ITC and relative position encoding [79] for ETC.\n7. BIGBIRD-ITC-base and BIGBIRD-ETC-base. The hyper-parameters for these two models are given in Tab. 8. In all experiments we use a learning rate warmup over the first 10,000 steps, and linear decay of the learning rate.\n8. As these tasks are very competitive, multiple highly engineered systems have been designed specific each dataset confirming to respective output formats. For a fair comparison, we had to use some additional regularization for training BIGBIRD, details of which are provided in App. E.2 along with exact architecture description. We experiment using the base sized model and select the best configuration on the development set for each dataset (as reported in Tab. 2).

Pretraining and MLM We follow [22,63] to create base and large versions of BIGBIRD and pretrain it using MLM objective. This task involves predicting a random subset of tokens which have been masked out. We use four standard data-sets for pretraining (listed in App. E.1, Tab. 9), warm-starting from the public RoBERTa checkpoint 2 . We compare performance in predicting the masked out tokens in terms of bits per character, following [8]. As seen in App. E.1, Tab. 10, both BIGBIRD and Longformer perform\n5. better than limited length RoBERTa, with BIGBIRD-ETC performing the best. We note that we trained our models on a reasonable 16GB memory/chip with batch size of 32-64.

There has been a recent upsurge in using deep learning for genomics data [86,106,13], which has resulted in improved performance on several biologically-significant tasks such as promoter site prediction [71], methylation analysis [55], predicting functional effects of non-coding variant [109], etc. These approaches consume DNA sequence fragments as inputs, and therefore we believe longer input sequence handling capability of BIGBIRD would be beneficial as many functional effects in DNA are highly non-local\n6. We propose BIGBIRD: a sparse attention mechanism that is linear in the number of tokens. BIGBIRD satisfies a number of theoretical results: it is a universal approximator of sequence to sequence functions and is also Turing complete. Theoretically, we use the power of extra global tokens preserve the expressive powers of the model. We complement these results by showing that moving to sparse attention mechanism do incur a cost. Empirically, BIGBIRD gives state-of-the-art performance on a number of NLP tasks\n7. such as question answering and long document classification. We further introduce attention based contextual language model for DNA and fine-tune it for down stream tasks such as promoter region prediction and predicting effects of non-coding variants.\n8.

Classification We experiment on datasets of different lengths and contents, specifically various document classification and GLUE tasks. Following BERT, we used one layer with cross entropy loss on top of the first [CLS] token. We see that gains of using BIGBIRD are more significant when we have longer documents and fewer training examples. For instance, using base sized model, BIGBIRD improves state-of-the-art for Arxiv dataset by about 5% points. On Patents dataset, there is improvement over using simple\n10. As these tasks are very competitive, multiple highly engineered systems have been designed specific each dataset confirming to respective output formats. For a fair comparison, we had to use some additional regularization for training BIGBIRD, details of which are provided in App. E.2 along with exact architecture description. We experiment using the base sized model and select the best configuration on the development set for each dataset (as reported in Tab. 2). We can see that BIGBIRD-ETC, with expanded\n11. We use four publicly available datasets Books [110], CC-News [34], Stories [89] and Wikipedia to pretrain BIGBIRD. We borrow the sentencepiece vocabulary as RoBERTa (which is in turn borrowed from GPT2). We split any document longer than 4096 into multiple documents and we join documents that were much smaller than 4096. Following the original BERT training, we mask 15% of tokens in these four datasets, and train to predict the mask. We warm start from RoBERTa's checkpoint. We train two different models:\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nWhat are the foreseeable characteristics that will influence how the model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent behaves? This includes domain and context, as well as population subgroups. Evaluation should ideally be disaggregated across factors in order to uncover disparities in performance.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent. If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model, here are some key characteristics that may influence the model's behavior:\n\nDomain and Context:\n- The model is designed to handle long document classification tasks where discriminating information may not be located in the first 512 tokens (Ref 1). This suggests the model is well-suited for domains with lengthy text inputs.\n- The model has been applied to genomics data, such as DNA sequence analysis for tasks like promoter site prediction and predicting effects of non-coding variants (Ref 5, 7). This indicates potential applicability in the bioinformatics domain.\n\nPopulation Subgroups:\n- [More Information Needed] The references do not provide clear information about performance across different population subgroups.\n\nOther Factors:\n- The model uses an efficient sparse attention mechanism that allows it to process longer input sequences (up to 4096 tokens) while maintaining memory efficiency (Ref 4, 6). This architectural choice influences the model's capabilities.\n- Pretraining was done using masked language modeling (MLM) on large datasets like Books, CC-News, Stories and Wikipedia (Ref 3, 11). The pretraining data characteristics can impact the model's knowledge and biases.\n\nEvaluation:\n- The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks like question answering and long document classification (Ref 6, 9). However, more disaggregated evaluation across different factors would help uncover potential performance disparities.\n\nIn summary, the google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent model is designed to handle long text sequences and has shown applicability in domains like NLP and genomics. The sparse attention mechanism and pretraining approach influence its capabilities. However, more information is needed to assess performance across population subgroups and conduct disaggregated evaluation."}

This type of error prioritizes fluency and coherence of the summary over strict factual accuracy. On the other hand, the model could produce summaries that are very literal and faithful to the source but lack the conciseness and readability expected in a good summary.\n\nAnother tradeoff lies in the model's handling of domain-specific terminology and jargon prevalent in patent documents. The model may struggle to accurately convey the meaning of technical terms in the summaries, leading to errors in precision. Alternatively, the model might rely too heavily on copying verbatim from the source text to ensure accuracy, at the cost of generating less abstractive and readable summaries.\n\nThe model's performance can also be affected by the length of the input documents. While BigBird architectures are designed to handle longer sequences, there may still be a tradeoff between processing very long patent documents in their entirety and splitting them into smaller chunks. Processing the full document at once may lead to errors related to memory constraints or the model's ability to maintain coherence across long distances. Splitting the document may result in errors related to loss of context and overall coherence of the summary.\n\nUltimately, the choice of which types of errors are more acceptable depends on the specific use case and requirements of the summarization task.

Following the original BERT training, we mask 15% of tokens in these four datasets, and train to predict the mask. We warm start from RoBERTa's checkpoint. We train two different models:"]}

BigBird, is a sparse-attention based transformer which extends Transformer based models, such as BERT to much longer sequences. Moreover, BigBird comes along with a theoretical understanding of the capabilities of a complete transformer that the sparse model can handle.\n\nAs a consequence of the capability to handle longer context,\nBigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization.\n2. In this section, we describe the BIGBIRD model using the generalised attention mechanism that is used in each layer of transformer operating on an input sequence X = (x 1 , ...,\nx n ) \u2208 R n\u00d7d .\n3. The second viewpoint which inspired the creation of BIGBIRD is that most contexts within NLP and computational biology have data which displays a great deal of locality of reference. In this phenomenon, a great deal of information about a token can be derived from its neighboring tokens. Most pertinently, Clark et al. [19] investigated self-attention models in NLP tasks and concluded that that neighboring inner-products are extremely important. The concept of locality, proximity of tokens in linguistic\n4. The final attention mechanism for BIGBIRD (Fig. 1d) has all three of these properties: queries attend to r random keys, each query attends to w/2 tokens to the left of its location and w/2 to the right of its location and they contain g global tokens (The global tokens can be from existing tokens or extra added tokens). We provide implementation details in App. D.\n5. The final piece of BIGBIRD is inspired from our theoretical analysis (Sec. 3), which is critical for empirical performance. More specifically, our theory utilizes the importance of \"global tokens\" (tokens that attend to all tokens in the sequence and to whom all tokens attend to (see Fig. 1c). These global tokens can be defined in two ways:\n6. properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having O(1) global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BIGBIRD drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question\n7. Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BIGBIRD, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BIGBIRD is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these\n8. 2. Empirically, we show that the extended context modelled by BIGBIRD benefits variety of NLP tasks. We achieve state of the art results for question answering and document summarization on a number of different datasets. Summary of these results are presented in Sec. 4.\n9. - pretrained Pegasus Encoder-Decoder Transformer in large size(`bigbp_large`). Again following original implementation of Pegasus, they are transformers with pre-normalization. They have full set of separate encoder-decoder weights. Also for long document summarization datasets, we have converted Pegasus checkpoints (`model.ckpt-0`) for each dataset and also provided fine-tuned checkpoints (`model.ckpt-300000`) which works on longer documents.\n10. We propose BIGBIRD: a sparse attention mechanism that is linear in the number of tokens. BIGBIRD satisfies a number of theoretical results: it is a universal approximator of sequence to sequence functions and is also Turing complete. Theoretically, we use the power of extra global tokens preserve the expressive powers of the model. We complement these results by showing that moving to sparse attention mechanism do incur a cost. Empirically, BIGBIRD gives state-of-the-art performance on a number of NLP tasks\n11. In particular, the query/key/value matrix of self-attention and all the feedforward layers are shared between encoder and decoder. The only variable that is initialized randomly is the encoder-decoder attention. For base sized model, we utilize our MLM pretrained model on 4096 sequence length from App. E.1, which is in turn initialized using the public RoBERTa checkpoint. For the large size model, we lift weight from the state-of-the-art Pegasus model [107], which is pretrained using an objective designed\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the model architecture and objective about the model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/bigbird-pegasus-large-bigpatent.
