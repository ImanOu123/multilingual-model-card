Vision Transformer (ViT): The document image is divided into patches, which are then linearly projected and fed into a standard transformer encoder. This allows the model to capture the spatial relationships and visual features of the document.\n\n2. Language Model: The question is tokenized and passed through a language model, which is typically a pre-trained model like BERT or RoBERTa. This helps the model understand the context and intent of the question.\n\n3. Cross-Attention Layers: The outputs from the vision transformer and language model are combined using cross-attention layers. This allows the model to attend to relevant parts of the document based on the question, enabling it to generate accurate answers.\n\n4. Answer Decoder: The output from the cross-attention layers is passed through a decoder, which generates the final answer.

Unlike conventional methods, Donut does not depend on OCR and can easily be trained in an end-to-end fashion.

Text Layout and Pattern To mimic the layouts in real-world documents, a heuristic rule-based pattern generator is applied to the document image region to generate text regions. The main idea is to set multiple squared regions to represent text paragraphs. Each squared text region is then interpreted as multiple lines of text. The size of texts and text region margins are chosen randomly.\n6. Our extensive experiments and analysis on both external public benchmarks and private internal service datasets show higher performance and better costeffectiveness of the proposed method.

This means that the pre-trained model can be directly applied to answer questions about the content of a given document image, without the need for additional training on a specific dataset.\n\nTo use the model without fine-tuning, you can simply provide an input document image and a question related to the content of the document. The model will process the image using its pre-trained Optical Character Recognition (OCR) component to extract the text from the document. It will then use its pre-trained language understanding capabilities to analyze the extracted text and the given question to generate an appropriate answer.\n\nThe advantage of using the model without fine-tuning is that it can be quickly deployed for various DocVQA tasks without requiring labeled data or additional training time. However, the performance of the model may be limited compared to a fine-tuned version that has been specifically adapted to a particular domain or dataset.", "The jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model is a powerful tool for document understanding and question answering. One of its key advantages is that it can be used without the need for post-processing. This means that the model can directly generate answers to questions based on the input document, without requiring any additional steps or manual intervention.\n\nThe model achieves this by leveraging a pre-trained Donut architecture, which combines a document understanding component with a question-answering module. The document understanding component extracts relevant information from the input document, such as text, layout, and visual features. This information is then fed into the question-answering module, which generates a natural language answer based on the extracted information and the given question.\n\nBy integrating these two components into a single end-to-end model, jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut eliminates the need for separate post-processing steps. The model can directly output the answer without requiring any additional processing or filtering of the generated text. This streamlined approach makes the model more efficient and easier to use in real-world applications, as it reduces the complexity and computational overhead associated with post-processing.\n\nIn summary, the jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model can be used without post-processing thanks to its end-to-end architecture, which combines document understanding and question answering into a single, integrated system. This allows for direct generation of answers from input documents, making the model more efficient and user-friendly.", "The jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model can be used without plugging it into a pipeline by directly utilizing the model's underlying architecture and weights. This approach involves loading the pre-trained model and performing the necessary preprocessing steps on the input data before passing it through the model for inference.\n\nTo use the model without a pipeline, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. Load the pre-trained jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model using a deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n\n2. Preprocess the input document image by applying techniques like resizing, normalization, and converting it to the appropriate format expected by the model.\n\n3. Extract the text from the document image using an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) library or tool. This step is necessary to obtain the textual content of the document.\n\n4. Tokenize and encode the extracted text and the input question using the tokenizer associated with the jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model. This step converts the text into numerical representations that the model can understand.\n\n5. Pass the encoded document text and question through the loaded model to obtain the predicted answer. The model will process the input and generate an output based on its trained weights and architecture.\n\n6. Postprocess the model's output if necessary, such as decoding the predicted answer back into human-readable text.\n\nBy following these steps, you can utilize the jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model without relying on a pre-built pipeline. This approach provides more flexibility and control over the individual components of the document question-answering process, allowing for customization and integration with other tools or frameworks as needed.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that using the model without a pipeline requires a deeper understanding of the model's architecture, input/output formats, and the necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps. It also involves more manual effort compared to using a pre-built pipeline that abstracts away some of the complexities.", "Certainly! Here's a short passage that answers the question about the model jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut and provides a code snippet to demonstrate its usage:\n\nThe jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model is a powerful tool for performing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on document images. It combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with a deep learning model called Donut to understand and answer questions based on the content of the document image.\n\nTo use this model, you can leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python. Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to load the model and perform inference:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import DonutProcessor, VisionEncoderDecoderModel\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Load the pre-trained model and processor\nmodel = VisionEncoderDecoderModel.from_pretrained(\"jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut\")\nprocessor = DonutProcessor.from_pretrained(\"jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut\")\n\n# Load and preprocess the document image\nimage = Image.open(\"path/to/document_image.jpg\")\npixel_values = processor(image, return_tensors=\"pt\").pixel_values\n\n# Prepare the question\nquestion = \"What is the total amount mentioned in the invoice?\"\n\n# Generate the answer\noutputs = model.generate(\n    pixel_values,\n    decoder_input_ids=processor.tokenizer.encode(question, return_tensors=\"pt\"),\n    max_length=50,\n    early_stopping=True,\n    num_beams=1,\n)\n\n# Decode the generated answer\nanswer = processor.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n\nprint(\"Question:\", question)\nprint(\"Answer:\", answer)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, we first load the pre-trained jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model and its associated processor using the `from_pretrained()` method from the Hugging Face Transformers library.\n\nNext, we load the document image using the PIL library and preprocess it using the loaded processor to obtain the pixel values.\n\nWe then prepare the question we want to ask about the document image. In this example, the question is \"What is the total amount mentioned in the invoice?\"\n\nFinally, we generate the answer using the `generate()` method of the model, passing the pixel values and the encoded question as inputs. We specify a maximum length of 50 tokens for the generated answer and enable early stopping and beam search with a single beam.\n\nThe generated answer is then decoded using the processor's `decode()` method, and we print both the question and the answer.\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to use the jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model to perform Visual Question Answering on a document image, allowing you to extract specific information based on the provided question."]}

Donut does not require off-the-shelf OCR engines/APIs, yet it shows state-of-the-art performances on various visual document understanding tasks, such as visual document classification or information extraction (a.k.a. document parsing).\n5. Document images, such as commercial invoices, receipts, and business cards, are easy to find in modern working environments. To extract useful information from such document images, Visual Document Understanding (VDU) has not been only an essential task for industry, but also a challenging topic for researchers, with applications including document classification [27,1], information extraction [22,42], and visual question answering [44,57].\n6.

In particular, Donut surpasses the Lay-outLMv2 accuracy reported in [64], while using fewer parameters with the 2x faster speed.

To validate the further capacity of the model, we conduct a document visual question answering task (DocVQA). In this task, a document image and question pair is given and the model predicts the answer for the question by capturing both visual and textual information within the image. We make the decoder generate the answer by setting the question as a starting prompt to keep the uniformity of the method (See Figure 3). DocVQA.

The tokenization process is an essential part of this preprocessing pipeline. Here's a detailed overview of the tokenization steps:\n\n1. Text Extraction: The input documents, which can be in various formats such as images or PDFs, undergo an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process to extract the text content. The OCR engine identifies and extracts the text from the document images.\n\n2. Text Cleaning: The extracted text is then cleaned by removing any unwanted characters, such as special symbols or non-printable characters. This step ensures that the text is in a consistent and processable format.\n\n3. Tokenization: The cleaned text is tokenized using a subword tokenization method, typically the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece algorithm. These tokenization methods break down the text into smaller subword units, which helps in handling out-of-vocabulary words and reduces the overall vocabulary size.\n\n4. Vocabulary Creation: A predefined vocabulary is used to map the subword tokens to integer IDs. This vocabulary is usually created during the model's pretraining phase and contains the most frequent subword units observed in the training data.\n\n5. Token IDs: Each subword token in the tokenized text is replaced with its corresponding integer ID from the vocabulary. This step converts the text into a sequence of numerical representations that can be processed by the model.\n\n6. Special Tokens: Special tokens, such as [CLS] (classification token) and [SEP] (separator token), are added to the token sequence. These tokens serve specific purposes in the model's architecture and help in tasks like sequence classification or separation of different parts of the input.\n\n7. Padding and Truncation: The token sequences are padded or truncated to a fixed length, depending on the model's maximum sequence length. Padding ensures that all sequences have the same length, while truncation limits the sequence length to fit within the model's constraints.\n\nBy following these tokenization steps, the input data is transformed into a format that can be effectively processed by the jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model.

This resizing step ensures that all input images have consistent dimensions, allowing the model to process them efficiently. The resized images are then normalized by subtracting the mean pixel values and dividing by the standard deviation, which helps to center and scale the pixel intensities. For text-based inputs, such as questions or document text, the preprocessing involves tokenization and encoding. The text is split into individual tokens using a tokenizer specific to the model, such as the BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding) tokenizer.

{"question": "preprocessing", "chain": "rev_retrieval", "prompt": ["The jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model, which is based on the Donut architecture, requires specific preprocessing steps for the input data before training and inference. The tokenization process is an essential part of this preprocessing pipeline. Here's a detailed overview of the tokenization steps:\n\n1. Text Extraction: The input documents, which can be in various formats such as images or PDFs, undergo an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process to extract the text content. The OCR engine identifies and extracts the text from the document images.\n\n2. Text Cleaning: The extracted text is then cleaned by removing any unwanted characters, such as special symbols or non-printable characters. This step ensures that the text is in a consistent and processable format.\n\n3. Tokenization: The cleaned text is tokenized using a subword tokenization method, typically the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece algorithm. These tokenization methods break down the text into smaller subword units, which helps in handling out-of-vocabulary words and reduces the overall vocabulary size.\n\n4. Vocabulary Creation: A predefined vocabulary is used to map the subword tokens to integer IDs. This vocabulary is usually created during the model's pretraining phase and contains the most frequent subword units observed in the training data.\n\n5. Token IDs: Each subword token in the tokenized text is replaced with its corresponding integer ID from the vocabulary. This step converts the text into a sequence of numerical representations that can be processed by the model.\n\n6. Special Tokens: Special tokens, such as [CLS] (classification token) and [SEP] (separator token), are added to the token sequence. These tokens serve specific purposes in the model's architecture and help in tasks like sequence classification or separation of different parts of the input.\n\n7. Padding and Truncation: The token sequences are padded or truncated to a fixed length, depending on the model's maximum sequence length. Padding ensures that all sequences have the same length, while truncation limits the sequence length to fit within the model's constraints.\n\nBy following these tokenization steps, the input data is transformed into a format that can be effectively processed by the jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model.

For image-based inputs, the preprocessing involves resizing the images to a fixed resolution of 224x224 pixels. This resizing step ensures that all input images have consistent dimensions, allowing the model to process them efficiently. The resized images are then normalized by subtracting the mean pixel values and dividing by the standard deviation, which helps to center and scale the pixel intensities. For text-based inputs, such as questions or document text, the preprocessing involves tokenization and encoding. The text is split into individual tokens using a tokenizer specific to the model, such as the BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding) tokenizer. The tokens are then converted into numerical representations, typically using an embedding layer or a pre-trained word embedding model. The encoded text is padded or truncated to a fixed length to ensure consistent input sizes.

Its ability to understand and extract information can be impacted by the layout, formatting, and complexity of the documents.\n\n2. Language and script: The model's behavior will be influenced by the language(s) and script(s) present in the documents. Its performance may differ when handling documents in various languages or with different writing systems (e.g., Latin, Chinese, Arabic).\n\n3. Image quality and resolution: The quality and resolution of the input document images will affect the model's ability to accurately recognize and extract text. Low-quality, blurry, or skewed images may lead to poorer performance compared to high-quality, clear images.\n\n4. Domain-specific vocabulary and jargon: If the model is applied to documents from specific domains (e.g., legal, medical, technical), its behavior will be influenced by its ability to understand and handle domain-specific vocabulary, abbreviations, and jargon.\n\n5. Question complexity and type: The model's performance will be affected by the complexity and type of questions asked. Simple, factual questions may be easier to answer than complex, multi-step, or reasoning-based questions.\n\n6.

Language: The model's behavior may vary depending on the language of the documents it processes. If the model was primarily trained on documents in a specific language or set of languages, it may perform better on documents in those languages compared to others.\n\n2. Document type: The model's performance may be affected by the type of documents it encounters, such as forms, invoices, receipts, or contracts. If the training data was biased towards certain document types, the model may exhibit better performance on those types.\n\n3. Handwriting styles: If the model is expected to process handwritten documents, its performance may be influenced by the diversity of handwriting styles in the population. The model may struggle with uncommon or highly stylized handwriting if not sufficiently represented in the training data.\n\n4. Document quality: The quality of the input documents, such as image resolution, contrast, and clarity, can impact the model's ability to accurately extract information.

{"question": "testing_metrics", "chain": "rev_retrieval", "prompt": ["Based on the information provided in the question, the jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model will likely be evaluated using standard metrics for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks on document images. Some commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of VQA models include:\n\n1. Accuracy: The percentage of correctly answered questions out of the total number of questions. This is the most straightforward metric to assess the model's overall performance.\n\n2. ANLS (Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity): This metric measures the similarity between the predicted answer and the ground truth answer, taking into account the order of words and penalizing errors based on the edit distance.\n\n3. BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): Originally designed for machine translation, BLEU can be used to evaluate the quality of generated answers by comparing them to the ground truth answers.\n\n4. F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, which assesses the model's ability to generate accurate and complete answers.\n\nThe choice of evaluation metrics may depend on the specific dataset and the nature of the answers expected from the model (e.g., short answers, long answers, or multiple-choice). The model's performance will be compared against the ground truth answers provided in the test set to compute these metrics and assess its effectiveness in answering questions from document images.", "When considering the tradeoffs between different errors in the jinhybr/OCR-DocVQA-Donut model, it's important to understand the balance between precision and recall. Precision refers to the accuracy of the model's predictions, while recall measures the model's ability to identify all relevant instances.\n\nOne potential tradeoff is between false positives and false negatives. False positives occur when the model incorrectly identifies a document or question as relevant, leading to unnecessary processing and potentially incorrect answers. On the other hand, false negatives happen when the model fails to recognize a relevant document or question, resulting in missed opportunities to provide accurate responses.\n\nAnother tradeoff to consider is the balance between the model's performance on different types of documents and questions. The model may excel at processing certain formats or answering specific question types while struggling with others. For example, it might perform well on structured forms but face challenges with handwritten or more complex documents.\n\nAdditionally, there is a tradeoff between the model's speed and accuracy. Increasing the model's complexity to improve accuracy may result in slower processing times, which could be problematic in real-time applications or when dealing with large volumes of data.\n\nUltimately, the choice of which tradeoffs to prioritize depends on the specific use case and requirements of the application. Some scenarios may demand high precision to avoid incorrect answers, while others may prioritize recall to ensure all relevant information is captured.

With the 1280\u00d7960 setting, the model training cost of Donut was small. For example, the model fine-tuning on CORD or Ticket took approximately 0.5 hours with one A100 GPU. However, when we set the\n3. input resolution of Donut is set to 2560\u00d71920 at the pre-training phase. In downstream tasks, the input resolutions are controlled. In some downstream document IE experiments, such as,  There is a hierarchy in the structure of information (i.e., depth = 2). Donut not only reads some important key information from the image, but also predicts the relationship among the extracted information (e.g., the name, price, and quantity of each menu item are grouped) CORD [45], Ticket [12] and Business Card, smaller\n4. For all model training, we use a half-precision (fp16) training. We train Donut using Adam optimizer [30] by decreasing the learning rate as the training progresses. The initial learning rate of pre-training is set to 1e-4 and that of finetuning is selected from 1e-5 to 1e-4. We pre-train the model for 200K steps with 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and a mini-batch size of 196, which takes about 2-3 GPU days. We also apply a gradient clipping technique where a maximum gradient norm is selected from 0.05 to 1.0. The\n5. which is much slower than A100. For the OCR based baselines, states-of-the-art OCR engines are used, including MS OCR API used in [64] and CLOVA OCR API 5 used in [24,23]. An analysis on OCR engines is available in Section 3.4. More details of OCR and training setups are available in Appendix A.1 and A.5.\n6. scheduled and the initial rate is selected from 1e-5 to 1e-4. The input resolution is set to 2560\u00d71920 and a max length in the decoder is set to 1536. All fine-tuning results are achieved by starting from the pre-trained multi-lingual model. Some hyperparameters are adjusted at fine-tuning and in ablation studies. We use 960\u00d71280 for Train Tickets and Business Card parsing tasks. We fine-tune the model while monitoring the edit distance over token sequences. The speed of Donut is measured on a P40 GPU,\n7. Document Classification. The results are shown in Table 1. Without relying on any other resource (e.g., off-the-shelf OCR engine), Donut shows a state-of-the-art performance among the general-purpose VDU models such as LayoutLM [65] and LayoutLMv2 [64]. In particular, Donut surpasses the Lay-outLMv2 accuracy reported in [64], while using fewer parameters with the 2x faster speed. Note that the OCR-based models must consider additional model parameters and speed for the entire OCR framework, which is not\n8. - [`donut-proto`](https://huggingface.co/naver-clova-ix/donut-proto/tree/official): (preliminary model) trained with 8 V100 GPUs (~5 days), number of layers (encoder: {2,2,18,2}, decoder: 4), input size 2048x1536, swin window size 8, and SynthDoG (English, Japanese, Korean, 0.4M x 3).\n9. the running time with MS OCR API used in [64]. The model in the third group is a DocVQA-specificpurposed fine-tuning model of LayoutLMv2, whose inference results are available in the official leader-board. 6 As can be seen, Donut achieves competitive scores with the baselines that are dependent on external OCR engines. Especially, Donut shows that it is robust to the handwritten documents, which is known to be challenging to process.
