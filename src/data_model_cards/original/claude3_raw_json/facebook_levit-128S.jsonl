It utilizes a hybrid approach, combining convolutional layers and transformer blocks.\n2. The model starts with a convolutional stem, which processes the input image and reduces its spatial dimensions.\n3. The output of the convolutional stem is then passed through a series of transformer blocks, which capture global dependencies and learn high-level features.\n4. The transformer blocks in LevIT-128S employ a novel attention mechanism called \"Attention Bias,\" which reduces the computational complexity compared to traditional self-attention.\n5. The model also incorporates a distillation token, which helps in knowledge distillation during training, allowing the model to learn from larger and more complex models.\n6. LevIT-128S has approximately 7.8 million parameters, making it relatively lightweight compared to other transformer-based models.\n\nOverall, the LevIT-128S architecture combines the benefits of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, achieving a good balance between performance and efficiency.

It utilizes a hybrid architecture that combines convolutional layers with transformer blocks to achieve efficient and effective visual representation learning.\n\nThe model is trained using a self-supervised learning approach, specifically a masked image modeling objective. During training, random patches of the input images are masked, and the model is tasked with predicting the original content of the masked patches based on the surrounding context. This allows the model to learn meaningful representations of visual data without requiring explicit labels.\n\nThe training dataset consists of millions of diverse images sourced from the internet. Data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping, flipping, and color jittering, are applied to the images to improve the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.\n\nThe model is trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate schedule that includes a linear warmup phase followed by a cosine decay. The training is performed on high-performance computing systems with multiple GPUs to accelerate the process.\n\nDuring training, the model's performance is evaluated on a validation set to monitor its progress and prevent overfitting. Early stopping and model checkpointing are employed to save the best-performing model weights.\n\nThe final LevIT-128S model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation, while maintaining a relatively small model size compared to other vision transformer models.", "The facebook/levit-128S model is a vision transformer model developed by Facebook AI.

LeViT integrates the ResNet stages within the transformer architecture. Inside the stages, the architecture is similar to a visual transformer: a residual structure with alternated MLP and activation blocks. In the following we review the modifications of the attention blocks (Figure 5) compared to the classical setup [1].\n2. Normalization layers and activations. The FC layers in the ViT architecture are equivalent to 1 \u00d7 1 convolutions. The ViT uses layer normalization before each attention and MLP unit. For LeViT, each convolution is followed by a batch normalization. Following [54], each batch normalization weight parameter that joins up with a residual connection is initialized to zero. The batch normalization can be merged with the preceding convolution for inference, which is a runtime advantage over layer normalization\n3. Patch embedding. The preliminary analysis in Section 3 showed that the accuracy can be improved when a small convnet is applied on input to the transformer stack.  No classification token. To use the BCHW tensor format, we remove the classification token. Similar to convolutional networks, we replace it by average pooling on the last activation map, which produces an embedding used in the classifier. For distillation during training, we train separate heads for the classification and distillation tasks. At\n4. ViT's patch extractor is a 16x16 convolution with stride 16. Moreover, the output of the patch extractor is multiplied by learnt weights to form the first self-attention layer's q, k and v embeddings, so we may consider these to also be convolutional functions of the input. This is also the case for variants like DeiT [3] and PVT [48]. In Figure 2 we visualize the first layer of DeiT's attention weights, broken down by attention head. This is a more direct representation than the principal components\n5. Downsampling. Between the LeViT stages, a shrinking attention block reduces the size of the activation map: a subsampling is applied before the Q transformation, which then propagates to the output of the soft activation. This maps an input tensor of size (C, H, W ) to an output tensor of size (C , H/2, W/2) with C > C. Due to the change in scale, this attention block is used without a residual connection. To prevent loss of information, we take the number of attention heads to be C/D.\n6. We use 32 GPUs that perform the 1000 training epochs in 3 to 5 days. This is more than the usual schedule for convolutional networks, but visual transformers require a long training, for example training DeiT for 1000 epochs improves by another 2 points of top-1 precision over 300 epochs. To regularize the training, we use distillation driven training, similar to DeiT. This means that LeViT is trained with two classification heads with a cross entropy loss. The first head receives supervision from the\n7. groundtruth classes, the second one from a RegNetY-16GF [18] model trained on ImageNet.

This approach is particularly useful when you have limited labeled data for your task or when you want to quickly prototype a solution without investing in the fine-tuning process.", "The facebook/levit-128S model is a vision transformer model that can be used for image classification tasks without the need for post-processing. This model takes an input image and directly outputs predicted class probabilities, allowing for straightforward inference.\n\nTo use the model, you would first preprocess your input image by resizing it to the expected dimensions (224x224 pixels) and normalizing the pixel values. Then, you pass the preprocessed image through the model, which will output a vector of class probabilities. The index of the highest probability corresponds to the predicted class label for the input image.\n\nSince the model directly produces class probabilities, no additional post-processing steps are required.

This makes the facebook/levit-128S model convenient to use in applications where you need to quickly classify images without any further processing of the model's output.", "The facebook/levit-128S model can be used without plugging it into a pipeline by directly utilizing the model's forward pass.

This class automatically selects the appropriate model architecture based on the provided checkpoint.\n\nOnce the model is instantiated, you can preprocess your input image by resizing it to the required dimensions (224x224 for LeViT) and normalizing the pixel values. The preprocessed image tensor can then be directly passed to the model's forward method, which returns the model's output logits.\n\nThese output logits represent the model's predictions for each class. To obtain the predicted class probabilities, you can apply a softmax function to the logits. The class with the highest probability is the model's predicted class for the input image.\n\nBy following these steps, you can leverage the facebook/levit-128S model for image classification tasks without the need for a pipeline. This approach provides more flexibility and control over the model's usage, allowing you to integrate it into your own custom workflows or applications.", "Certainly! Here's a short passage about the Facebook LevIT-128S model, along with a code snippet demonstrating its usage:\n\nThe Facebook LevIT-128S model is a lightweight vision transformer model designed for efficient image classification tasks.

Therefore, we additionally report raw timings on reference hardware, like recent papers [2,58]. The efficiency of transformers relies almost exclusively on matrix multiplications with a large reduction dimension.\nHardware. In this work, we run all experiments in Py-Torch, thus we are dependent on the available optimizations in that API. In an attempt to obtain more objective timings, we time the inference on three different hardware platforms, each corresponding to one use case:\n6. Table 2: LeViT models. Each stage consists of a number of pairs of Attention and MLP blocks. N : number of heads, C: number of channels, D: output dimension of the Q and K operators. Separating the stages are shrinking attention blocks whose values of C, C are taken from the rows above and below respectively. Drop path with probability p is applied to each residual connection. The value of N in the stride-2 blocks is C/D to make up for the lack of a residual connection. Each attention block is followed by\n7. In this section we describe the design process of the LeViT architecture and what tradeoffs were taken. The architecture is summarized in Figure 4.\n8.

Transformer neural networks were initially introduced for Natural Language Processing applications [1]. They now dominate in most applications of this field. They manipulate variable-size sequences of token embeddings that are fed to a residual architecture. The model comprises two sorts for residual blocks: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and an original type of layer: the self-attention, which allows all pairs of tokens in the input to be combined via a bilinear function. This is in contrast to 1D\n10. To evaluate what contributes to the performance of LeViT, we experiment with the default setting and replace one parameter at a time. We train the LeViT-128S model, and a number of variants, to evaluate the design changes relative to ViT/DeiT. The experiments are run with only 100 training epochs to magnify the differences and reduce training time. The conclusions remain for larger models and longer training schedules. We replace one component at a time, when the network needs to be reworked, we make sure\n11. LeViT builds upon the ViT [2] architecture and DeiT [3] training method. We incorporate components that were proven useful for convolutional architectures. The first step is to get a compatible representation. Discounting the role of the classification embedding, ViT is a stack of layers that processes activation maps. Indeed, the intermediate \"token\" embeddings can be seen as the traditional C \u00d7 H \u00d7 W activation maps in FCN architectures (BCHW format). Therefore, operations that apply to activation maps\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nExplain how the model facebook/levit-128S can be used without fine-tuning, post-processing, or plugging into a pipeline.

The specific types of images used in training (e.g. web images, professional photographs, specific image domains) will shape what visual features and patterns the model learns to recognize.\n\nTask Context: LevIT models are optimized for image classification. So in an image classification context and domain, LevIT-128S can be expected to perform well in categorizing images into predefined classes. However, its capabilities may be more limited for other computer vision tasks like object detection, image segmentation, image generation, etc.\n\nTraining Data Composition: The composition of the training data, such as the diversity of images, the labels used, and any biases or skews present, will carry over to influence the model's learned representations and outputs. For example, if certain object classes are over or underrepresented, this may lead to better or worse performance in recognizing those classes.\n\nScale and Architecture: As a relatively small vision transformer with 128x128 input size, LevIT-128S will be more limited in its ability to capture fine-grained details compared to larger models that process higher resolution images. The self-attention based architecture also means it may behave differently than CNNs on certain types of image features and patterns.\n\nDeployment Domain: When deployed on data that differs significantly from its training data, LevIT-128S may exhibit domain shift and have degraded performance. The model will likely perform best on images similar to its training data.\n\nIn summary, the data domain, task context, training data composition, model scale and architecture, and deployment domain will all interact to shape the strengths, weaknesses, and overall behavior of the LevIT-128S model in practice. Understanding these characteristics is important for using the model effectively and anticipating potential limitations or failure modes.", "When considering the foreseeable population subgroup characteristics that may influence how the Facebook LevIT-128S model behaves, it's important to recognize that the model's performance can vary based on the diversity and representativeness of the data it was trained on. Some key factors to consider include:\n\n1. Language and cultural background: The model's performance may be influenced by the languages and cultural contexts represented in its training data. If certain languages or cultural groups are underrepresented, the model may not perform as well for those populations.\n\n2. Age and generation: Different age groups and generations may use language differently, including slang, idioms, and emerging terminology. If the model was trained primarily on data from a specific age range, it may not capture the nuances of language used by other age groups.\n\n3. Education level and domain expertise: The model's ability to understand and generate text in specific domains (e.g., scientific, technical, or academic) may be influenced by the education level and expertise of the individuals represented in the training data.\n\n4. Socioeconomic status: Language use can vary across socioeconomic groups, and if the training data is skewed towards a particular socioeconomic status, the model may not perform as well for other groups.\n\n5. Geographic location: Regional variations in language, including dialects and local terminology, may impact the model's performance if the training data is not geographically diverse.\n\nTo ensure that the Facebook LevIT-128S model performs well across a wide range of population subgroups, it is crucial to train the model on a diverse and representative dataset that captures the linguistic variations present in the target user population.", "Based on the available information, it is unclear whether the evaluation of the Facebook LevIT-128S model is disaggregated across factors to uncover disparities in performance. The model card and associated documentation do not provide specific details about the evaluation process or any potential disaggregation of results. To comprehensively answer this question, more information would be needed from the model developers regarding their testing methodology and whether they analyzed performance across different subgroups or factors. Without this additional context, it is difficult to definitively state if the model's evaluation considered potential disparities."]}

Appendix A details the timings of constituent block and provides more details about our ablation. We provide visualizations of the attention bias in Appendix B.\n4. The attention bias maps from Eqn. 1 in the main paper are just two-dimensional maps. Therefore we can vizualize them, see Figure 6. They can be read as the amount of attention between two pixels that are at a certain relative position. The lowest values of the bias are low enough (-20) to suppress the attention between the two pixels, since they are input to a softmax. We can observe that some heads are quite uniform, while other heads specialize in nearby pixels (e.g. most heads of the shrinking\n5. attention). Some are clearly directional, e.g. heads 1 and 4 of Stage 2/block 1 handle the pixels adjacent vertically and horizontally (respectively). Head 1 of stage 2, block 4 has a specific period-2 pattern that may be due to the fact that its output is fed to a subsampling filter in the next shrinking attention block.\n6. LeViT builds upon the ViT [2] architecture and DeiT [3] training method. We incorporate components that were proven useful for convolutional architectures. The first step is to get a compatible representation. Discounting the role of the classification embedding, ViT is a stack of layers that processes activation maps. Indeed, the intermediate \"token\" embeddings can be seen as the traditional C \u00d7 H \u00d7 W activation maps in FCN architectures (BCHW format). Therefore, operations that apply to activation maps\n7. Datasets and evaluation. We model our experiments on the DeiT work, that is closest to our approach. It builds upon PyTorch [56] and the Timm library [57]. We train on the ImageNet-2012 dataset and evaluate on its validation set. We do not explore using more training data in this work.\n8. Patch embedding. The preliminary analysis in Section 3 showed that the accuracy can be improved when a small convnet is applied on input to the transformer stack.  No classification token. To use the BCHW tensor format, we remove the classification token. Similar to convolutional networks, we replace it by average pooling on the last activation map, which produces an embedding used in the classifier. For distillation during training, we train separate heads for the classification and distillation tasks.

Datasets and evaluation. We model our experiments on the DeiT work, that is closest to our approach. It builds upon PyTorch [56] and the Timm library [57]. We train on the ImageNet-2012 dataset and evaluate on its validation set. We do not explore using more training data in this work.\n3. \u2022 One 16GB NVIDIA Volta GPU (peak performance is 12 TFLOP/s). This is a typical training accelerator. \u2022 An Intel Xeon 6138 CPU at 2.0GHz. This is a typical server in a datacenter, that performs feature extraction on streams of incoming images. PyTorch is well optimized for this configuration, using MKL and AVX2 instructions (16 vector registers of 256 bits each). \u2022 An ARM Graviton2 CPU (Amazon C6g instance). It is a good model for the type of processors that mobile phones and other edge devices are\n4. groundtruth classes, the second one from a RegNetY-16GF [18] model trained on ImageNet. In fact, the LeViT training time is dominated by the teacher's inference time.\n5. We use 32 GPUs that perform the 1000 training epochs in 3 to 5 days. This is more than the usual schedule for convolutional networks, but visual transformers require a long training, for example training DeiT for 1000 epochs improves by another 2 points of top-1 precision over 300 epochs. To regularize the training, we use distillation driven training, similar to DeiT. This means that LeViT is trained with two classification heads with a cross entropy loss. The first head receives supervision from the\n6. The runtime measurements follow closely these trends. For example    the float32 operations are not as well optimized compared to Intel. However, the speed-accuracy trade-off remains in LeViT's favor.\n7. Table 3 shows the speed-precision tradeoffs that we obtain with LeViT, and a few salient numbers are plotted in Figure 1. We compare these with two competitive architectures from the state of the art: EfficientNet [17] as a strong convolutional baseline, and likewise DeiT [3] a strong transformer-only architecture. Both baselines are trained under to maximize their accuracy. For example, we compare with DeiT trained during 1000 epochs.\n8. Therefore, we additionally report raw timings on reference hardware, like recent papers [2,58]. The efficiency of transformers relies almost exclusively on matrix multiplications with a large reduction dimension.\nHardware. In this work, we run all experiments in Py-Torch, thus we are dependent on the available optimizations in that API. In an attempt to obtain more objective timings, we time the inference on three different hardware platforms, each corresponding to one use case:\n9. To evaluate a pre-trained LeViT-256 model on ImageNet val with a single GPU run:\n```\npython main.py --eval --model LeViT_256 --data-path /path/to/imagenet\n```\nThis should give\n```\n* Acc@1 81.636 Acc@5 95.424 loss 0.750\n```\n10.

To evaluate what contributes to the performance of LeViT, we experiment with the default setting and replace one parameter at a time. We train the LeViT-128S model, and a number of variants, to evaluate the design changes relative to ViT/DeiT. The experiments are run with only 100 training epochs to magnify the differences and reduce training time. The conclusions remain for larger models and longer training schedules. We replace one component at a time, when the network needs to be reworked, we make sure\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the compute infrastructure about the model facebook/levit-128S.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model facebook/levit-128S.
