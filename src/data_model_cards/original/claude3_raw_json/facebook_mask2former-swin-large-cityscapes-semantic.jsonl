Semantic segmentation. We follow the same settings as [14] to train our models, except: 1) a learning rate multiplier of 0.1 is applied to both CNN and Transformer backbones instead of only applying it to CNN backbones in [14], 2) both ResNet and Swin backbones use an initial learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.05, instead of using Beyond the PQ metric, our Mask2Former\n2. also achieves higher performance on two other metrics compared to DETR [5] and MaskFormer: AP Th pan , which is the AP evaluated on the 80 \"thing\" categories using instance segmentation annotation, and mIoU pan , which is the mIoU evaluated on the 133 categories for semantic segmentation converted from panoptic segmentation annotation. This shows Mask2Former's universality: trained only with panoptic segmentation annotations, it can be used for instance and semantic segmentation. Instance segmentation. We\n3. compare Mask2Former with state-of-the-art models on the COCO [35] dataset in Table 2. With ResNet [25] backbone, Mask2Former outperforms a strong Mask R-CNN [24] baseline using largescale jittering (LSJ) augmentation [18,23]\n4. query features are directly supervised before being used in the Transformer decoder to predict masks (M 0 ). We find these learnable query features function like a region proposal network [43] and have the ability to generate mask proposals. Finally, we find dropout is not necessary and usually decreases performance. We thus completely remove dropout in our decoder.\n5. We now present Mask2Former. We first review a meta architecture for mask classification that Mask2Former is built upon. Then, we introduce our new Transformer decoder with masked attention which is the key to better convergence and results. Lastly, we propose training improvements that make Mask2Former efficient and accessible.\n6. Image segmentation groups pixels with different semantics, e.g., category or instance membership. Each choice of semantics defines a task. While only the semantics of each task differ, current research focuses on designing specialized architectures for each task. We present Maskedattention Mask Transformer (Mask2Former), a new architecture capable of addressing any image segmentation task (panoptic, instance or semantic). Its key components include masked attention, which extracts localized features by\n7. constraining cross-attention within predicted mask regions. In addition to reducing the research effort by at least three times, it outperforms the best specialized architectures by a significant margin on four popular datasets. Most notably, Mask2Former sets a new state-of-the-art for panoptic segmentation (57.8 PQ on COCO), instance segmentation (50.1 AP on COCO) and semantic segmentation (57.7 mIoU on ADE20K).\n8. We evaluate Mask2Former on three image segmentation tasks (panoptic, instance and semantic segmentation) using four popular datasets (COCO [35], Cityscapes [16], ADE20K [65] and Mapillary Vistas [42]). For the first time, on all these benchmarks, our single architecture performs on par or better than specialized architectures. Mask2Former sets the new state-of-the-art of 57.8 PQ on COCO panoptic segmentation [28], 50.1 AP on COCO instance segmentation [35] and 57.7 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation [65]\n9. segmentation follow semantic segmentation training settings), except that we use 200 queries for panoptic and instance segmentation models with Swin-L backbone.

Image Resizing: The input image is resized to a fixed size, typically 1024x1024 pixels, to ensure consistent input dimensions for the model.\n\n2. Patch Splitting: The resized image is divided into non-overlapping patches of a fixed size, such as 32x32 pixels. Each patch represents a local region of the image.\n\n3. Patch Embedding: Each image patch is projected into a high-dimensional embedding space using a linear projection layer. This step converts the pixel values of each patch into a dense vector representation.\n\n4. Position Embedding: To preserve the spatial information of the patches, position embeddings are added to the patch embeddings. These position embeddings encode the relative position of each patch within the image.\n\n5. Transformer Encoding: The patch embeddings with position information are then passed through the Swin Transformer encoder layers. The Swin Transformer uses a hierarchical structure with shifted windows to capture both local and global dependencies in the image.\n\n6.

This is done to ensure consistent input dimensions for the model. The aspect ratio of the images is maintained during the resizing process.\n\n2. Normalization: The pixel values of the input images are normalized to a range of [0, 1]. This is a common practice in deep learning models to facilitate faster convergence and better performance. The normalization is typically performed by dividing the pixel values by 255 (assuming 8-bit images).\n\n3. Encoding: The resized and normalized images are then encoded using the Swin Transformer backbone of the Mask2Former model. The Swin Transformer is a hierarchical vision transformer that captures multi-scale features from the input images. It divides the images into non-overlapping patches and applies self-attention mechanisms to learn representations at different scales.\n\n4.

We follow the same settings as [14] to train our models, except: 1) a learning rate multiplier of 0.1 is applied to both CNN and Transformer backbones instead of only applying it to CNN backbones in [14], 2) both ResNet and Swin backbones use an initial learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.05, instead of using Beyond the PQ metric, our Mask2Former\n2. We adopt settings from [14] with the following differences: Pixel decoder. Mask2Former is compatible with any existing pixel decoder module. In MaskFormer [14], FPN [33] is chosen as the default for its simplicity. Since our goal is to demonstrate strong performance across different segmentation tasks, we use the more advanced multi-scale deformable attention Transformer (MSDeformAttn) [66] as our default pixel decoder. Specifically, we use 6 MSDefor-mAttn layers applied to feature maps with resolution 1/8,\n3. also achieves higher performance on two other metrics compared to DETR [5] and MaskFormer: AP Th pan , which is the AP evaluated on the 80 \"thing\" categories using instance segmentation annotation, and mIoU pan , which is the mIoU evaluated on the 133 categories for semantic segmentation converted from panoptic segmentation annotation. This shows Mask2Former's universality: trained only with panoptic segmentation annotations, it can be used for instance and semantic segmentation. Instance segmentation. We\n4. truth. Post-processing. We use the exact same post-processing as [14] to acquire the expected output format for panoptic and semantic segmentation from pairs of binary masks and class predictions. Instance segmentation requires additional confidence scores for each prediction. We multiply class confidence and mask confidence (i.e., averaged foreground per-pixel binary mask probability) for a final confidence.\n5. 1/16 and 1/32, and use a simple upsampling layer with lateral connection on the final 1/8 feature map to generate the feature map of resolution 1/4 as the per-pixel embedding. In our ablation study, we show that this pixel decoder provides best results across different segmentation tasks. Transformer decoder.

All other backbones or semantic segmentation models use 100 queries. Results. In Table VII, we report Mask2Former results obtained with various backbones on Cityscapes for three segmentation tasks and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods without using extra data.

The final binary mask predictions are decoded from per-pixel embeddings with object queries. One successful instantiation of such a meta architecture is MaskFormer [14], and we refer readers to [14] for more details.\n8. Image segmentation groups pixels with different semantics, e.g., category or instance membership. Each choice of semantics defines a task. While only the semantics of each task differ, current research focuses on designing specialized architectures for each task. We present Maskedattention Mask Transformer (Mask2Former), a new architecture capable of addressing any image segmentation task (panoptic, instance or semantic). Its key components include masked attention, which extracts localized features by\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide detail tokenization, resizing/rewriting (depending on the modality), etc. about the preprocessing for the data of the model facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model facebook/mask2former-swin-large-cityscapes-semantic.

We adopt settings from [14] with the following differences: Pixel decoder. Mask2Former is compatible with any existing pixel decoder module. In MaskFormer [14], FPN [33] is chosen as the default for its simplicity. Since our goal is to demonstrate strong performance across different segmentation tasks, we use the more advanced multi-scale deformable attention Transformer (MSDeformAttn) [66] as our default pixel decoder. Specifically, we use 6 MSDefor-mAttn layers applied to feature maps with resolution 1/8,\n2. We demonstrate Mask2Former is an effective architecture for universal image segmentation through comparisons with specialized state-of-the-art architectures on standard benchmarks. We evaluate our proposed design decisions through ablations on all three tasks. Finally we show Mask2Former generalizes beyond the standard benchmarks, obtaining state-of-the-art results on four datasets. Datasets. We study Mask2Former using four widely used image segmentation datasets that support semantic, instance and panoptic\n3. truth. Post-processing. We use the exact same post-processing as [14] to acquire the expected output format for panoptic and semantic segmentation from pairs of binary masks and class predictions. Instance segmentation requires additional confidence scores for each prediction. We multiply class confidence and mask confidence (i.e., averaged foreground per-pixel binary mask probability) for a final confidence.\n4. 1/16 and 1/32, and use a simple upsampling layer with lateral connection on the final 1/8 feature map to generate the feature map of resolution 1/4 as the per-pixel embedding. In our ablation study, we show that this pixel decoder provides best results across different segmentation tasks. Transformer decoder.

We first provide more results for Mask2Former with different backbones as well as test-set performance on standard benchmarks (Appendix A): We use COCO panoptic [28] for panoptic, COCO [35] for instance, and ADE20K [65] for semantic segmentation.
