Finally, to emphasize the filtering/compression property of the encoder as well as its shape, we name the proposed model Funnel-Transformer (F-TFM).\n3. With the architecture design specified, we now analyze how the sequence compression affects the complexity and capacity of the proposed model, especially compared to the standard Transformer. Firstly, for a Transformer layer with an S-Attn and a P-FFN module of hidden size D, the complexity of processing a length-T sequence is O(T 2 D + T D 2 ). 2 Hence, every time the sequence length is reduced by half in the encoder, we enjoy a super-linear (more than half) complexity drop. In practice, as the O(T D 2 )\n4. layers of hidden size 768 (L12H768), we may construct a Funnel-Transformer of 3 blocks where each block has 6 layers of hidden size 768 (B6-6-6H768). Despite having 18 layers in total, when finetuned for classification, the FLOPs of the B6-6-6H768 architecture only corresponds to at most 6 + 6/2 + 6/4 = 10.5 full-length layers, clearly fewer than that of L12H768.

To inherit the high capacity and optimization advantages of the Transformer architecture, the proposed model keeps the same overall skeleton of\n6. In this section, we empirically evaluate the proposed F-TFM by first pretraining it and then finetuning it in downstream tasks. Following previous work, for pretraining, we consider two common settings:\n\u2022 Base scale: Pretraining models for 1M steps with batch size 256 on Wikipedia + Book Corpus. This is the setting used by original BERT [2]. We will rely on this setting to perform fair comparison between F-TFM and the standard Transformer as well as some ablation studies.\n7. \u2022 The number of attention heads is \"hidden size/64\". Finally, another important element in pretraining is the mask sampling strategy. For MLM training, following previous work, we always complete word span (up to 5 complete words) sampling. However, for ELECTRA training, we notice a weird phenomenon that under the base-scale setting, the performance of both the Transformer and the F-TFM drops significantly if we use word span sampling rather than the single-token sampling. On the other hand, under the\n8. \u2022 Large scale: Pretraining models for 500K steps with batch size 8K on the five datasets used by XLNet [3] and ELECTRA [5] (Wikipedia + Book Corpus + ClueWeb + Gigaword + Common Crawl).

The acting was brilliant and the plot kept me engaged throughout.\"\n\n# Perform text classification\nresult = classifier(text)\n\n# Print the classification result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, we first import the necessary classes from the Transformers library.

Then, for each Transformer baseline, we construct F-TFMs of different block layouts and parameters, while ensuring the F-TFMs always have fewer or similar FLOPs. Based on the MLM pretraining objective, the results on GLUE benchmark\n3. In this section, we empirically evaluate the proposed F-TFM by first pretraining it and then finetuning it in downstream tasks. Following previous work, for pretraining, we consider two common settings:\n\u2022 Base scale: Pretraining models for 1M steps with batch size 256 on Wikipedia + Book Corpus. This is the setting used by original BERT [2]. We will rely on this setting to perform fair comparison between F-TFM and the standard Transformer as well as some ablation studies.\n4. \u2022 Large scale: Pretraining models for 500K steps with batch size 8K on the five datasets used by XLNet [3] and ELECTRA [5] (Wikipedia + Book Corpus + ClueWeb + Gigaword + Common Crawl). We will compare F-TFM trained at this scale with previous state-of-the-art methods. For finetuning, we mainly focus on sequence-level tasks that only requires a single vectorial representation of the input sequence, since F-TFM is designed with such a purpose in mind. Specifically, such tasks include the GLUE benchmark for\n5. apply F-TFM to token-level tasks by additionally finetuning the decoder. To test this ability, we finetune F-TFM on the SQuAD datasets and compare it with previous models in Table 5. While F-TFM outperforms previous models in the base group by a large margin, in the large model group, the F-TFM with about 83% FLOPs (B10-10-10) still falls behind the standard Transformer that always maintains a full-length token-level representations. This suggests sequential compression could harm the performance when\n6. **Funnel-Transformer** is a new self-attention model that gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, Funnel-Transformer usually has a higher capacity given the same FLOPs. In addition, with a decoder, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover the token-level deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence, which\n7. In this section, we discuss some potential model extensions of Funnel-Transformer. As described in section 2, Funnel-Transformer can be divided into an encoder with a compression functionality and a decoder that recovers the full-length token-level representations. To further extend the proposed model, first note that the encoder-decoder framework can be formulated into a more general form:\n8. In this work, under the pretraining-finetuning paradigm, we investigate a largely overlooked dimension of complexity in language processing. With the proposed Funnel-Transformer, we show how sequential resolution can be compressed in a simple form to save computation and how the saved FLOPs can be re-invested in improving the model capacity and hence the performance. Open challenges for future research include the better ways to improve the compression scheme, to optimize the block layout design and to\n9. the key difference compared to conventional models is the source side compression Funnel-Transformer provides. Overall, we summarize some potential directions to extend Funnel-Transformer presented in section 2.2 to NLP problems. Finally, although we focus on discussion on the NLP tasks in this paper, Funnel-Transformer could be applied to any tasks dealing with sequential data, such as time series and video stream analysis.\n10. **Funnel-Transformer** is a new self-attention model that gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost.

But due to the page constraint, we refer readers to Appendix C.1.\n4. Firstly, we evaluate how F-TFM performs compared to the standard Transformer under similar amount of computation (i.e., FLOPs). For this purpose, we consider three commonly used model sizes for the standard Transformer, namely large (L24H1024), base (L12H768) and small (L6H768). Then, for each Transformer baseline, we construct F-TFMs of different block layouts and parameters, while ensuring the F-TFMs always have fewer or similar FLOPs. Based on the MLM pretraining objective, the results on GLUE benchmark\n5. In this section, we empirically evaluate the proposed F-TFM by first pretraining it and then finetuning it in downstream tasks. Following previous work, for pretraining, we consider two common settings:\n\u2022 Base scale: Pretraining models for 1M steps with batch size 256 on Wikipedia + Book Corpus. This is the setting used by original BERT [2]. We will rely on this setting to perform fair comparison between F-TFM and the standard Transformer as well as some ablation studies.\n6. \u2022 Pool-query-only design\n\u2022 Separating [cls] in the pooling operation\n\u2022 Block layout design: In our experiments, all models actually utilize a 3-block design.

We compare this parameterization with the learned absolute position embedding as used in the BERT [2].\n7. block layout given this depth-length trade-off remains an open challenge. For this work, we only consider relatively regular layout and leave more systematic studies for future work. Finally, notice that trading sequential resolution for depth or width has a side effect of increasing the total number of parameters. For instance, B6-6-6H768 has 1.5x Transformer parameters compared to L12H768. In practice, more parameters may increase communication cost in distributed training as well as the memory\n8. layers of hidden size 768 (L12H768), we may construct a Funnel-Transformer of 3 blocks where each block has 6 layers of hidden size 768 (B6-6-6H768). Despite having 18 layers in total, when finetuned for classification, the FLOPs of the B6-6-6H768 architecture only corresponds to at most 6 + 6/2 + 6/4 = 10.5 full-length layers, clearly fewer than that of L12H768. More importantly, as we will show in the experiments, B6-6-6H768 significantly outperforms L12H768. While intuitive, how to construct an optimal\n9. additional decoder input.

In each model group, the standard Transformer (first model) is used as the benchmark for the\n10. shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further improve the model capacity.

By re-investing the saved computation from length reduction, the model can be made deeper or wider to improve capacity while maintaining comparable or fewer FLOPs compared to standard models.\n\nSome aspects that could contribute to the explainability and interpretability of the funnel-transformer/small model include:\n\n1. Analyzing the attention maps from the self-attention layers to understand which positions the model attends to most and carries critical information about the sequence. This could provide insights into what the model focuses on for a given input.\n\n2. Examining the behavior of the decoder in recovering token-level deep representations from the reduced hidden sequence.
