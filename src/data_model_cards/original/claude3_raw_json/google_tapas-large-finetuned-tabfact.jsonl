(2020)\n- Uses token embeddings, position embeddings, segment embeddings, column embeddings, row embeddings, and rank embeddings for numeric columns\n- Passes the input sequence through a transformer to obtain contextual representations for each token\n- Models the probability of entailment using an MLP on the output of the [CLS] token\n\nTraining Procedures: \n- Starts with the public TAPAS checkpoint\n- Trains an entailment model on counterfactual and synthetic data \n- Fine-tunes on the TABFACT end task\n- Reports median accuracy over 9 runs (3 pre-training x 3 fine-tuning)\n- Optimizes hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization, looking at validation accuracy after 8,000 steps\n- Hyperparameter ranges: learning rate 10^-6 to 3x10^-4, dropout 0 to 0.2, warmup ratio 0 to 0.05\n\nParameters:\n- Provides pre-trained models for different model sizes\n- [More Information Needed] on the exact model sizes and number of parameters\n\nImportant Disclaimers:\n- Some TABFACT input examples can be too long for BERT-based models\n- Evaluates table pruning techniques as a pre-processing step to select relevant columns that respect input length limits\n\nThe model achieves over 9 points higher accuracy than the previous TABFACT state-of-the-art. Training on both counterfactual and synthetic data yields the best performance at 79.6% accuracy.\n\nFor more details or questions, please contact [More Information Needed]."}

We evaluate our model on the recently released TABFACT dataset . The tables are extracted from Wikipedia and the sentences written by crowd workers in two batches. The first batch consisted of simple sentences, that instructed the writers to refer to a single row in the table. The second one, created complex sentences by asking writers to use information from multiple rows.\n2. A recent example is TABFACT , a dataset of statements that are either entailed or refuted by tables from Wikipedia (Figure 1). Because solving these entailment problems requires sophisticated reasoning and higher-order operations like arg max, averaging, or comparing, human accuracy remains substantially (18 points) ahead of the best models (Zhong et al., 2020).\n3. The current models are dominated by semantic parsing approaches that attempt to create logical forms from weak supervision. We, on the other hand, follow Herzig et al. (2020) and  and encode the tables with BERT-based models to directly predict the entailment decision. But while BERT models for text have been scrutinized and optimized for how to best pre-train and represent textual data, the same attention has not been applied to tabular data, limiting the effectiveness in this setting. This paper\n4. iii) Using the pre-training tasks, we set the new state-of-the-art on TABFACT out-performing previous models by 6 points when using a BERT-base model and 9 points for a BERT-large model. The procedure is data efficient and can get comparable accuracies to previous approaches when using only 10% of the data. We perform a detailed analysis of the improvements in Section 6. Finally, we show that our method improves the state-of-the-art on a question answering task (SQA) by 4 points.\n5. Our main contributions are the following: i) We introduce two intermediate pre-training tasks, which are learned from a trained MASK-LM model, one based on synthetic and the other from counterfactual statements. The first one generates a sentence by sampling from a set of logical expressions that filter, combine and compare the information on the table, which is required in table entailment (e.g., knowing that Gerald Ford is taller than the average president requires summing all presidents and dividing by\n6.

This relatively good accuracy mostly stems from the counterfactual data.", "Section 3.3 and Appendix A.4, we can increase the model efficiency by reducing the input length. By pruning the input of the TABFACT data we can improve training as well as inference time. We compare pruning with the heuristic entity linking (HEL)  and heuristic exact match (HEM) to different target lengths. We also studied other pruning methods, the results are reported in Appendix F. In Table 4 we find that HEM consistently outperforms HEL. The best model at length 256, while twice as fast to train (and", "apply), is only 0.8 points behind the best full length model. Even the model    with length 128, while using a much shorter length, out-performs TABLE-BERT by more than 7 points.

This requires sophisticated reasoning and operations like filtering, combining, comparing and aggregating information across table rows and columns.\n\n- The model sets a new state-of-the-art on the TABFACT dataset, outperforming previous models by 9 points.

If the tables it was trained on contained biased, incorrect, or incomplete information, the model's entailment judgments may perpetuate those issues.\n\n- Table entailment is a narrow task and the model is unlikely to generalize well to other types of reasoning or language understanding beyond statements that can be directly verified against a table. Applying it outside this scope may lead to unreliable outputs.\n\n- As a large deep learning model, its reasoning process is opaque and it may be difficult to understand the basis for its entailment decisions. This lack of explainability could be an issue for some use cases.\n\n- Adversarial attacks or edge cases may cause the model to confidently make incorrect entailment judgments. Extensive testing would be needed to identify potential failure modes.\n\n- The model has no built-in common sense reasoning or real-world knowledge.

Model Agreement Similar to other complex binary classification datasets such as BOOLQ , for TABFACT one may question whether models are guessing the right answer. To detect the magnitude of this issue we look at 9 independent runs of each variant and analyze how many of them agree on the correct answer. Figure 5 shows that while for MASK-LM only for 24.2% of the examples all models agree on the right answer, it goes up to 55.5% when using using the counterfactual and synthetic pre-training. This suggests\n2. We introduced two pre-training tasks, counterfactual and synthetic, to obtain state-of-the-art results on the TABFACT  entailment task on tabular data. We adapted the BERT-based architecture of TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020) to binary classification and showed that pre-training on both tasks yields substantial improvements on TAB-FACT but also on a QA dataset, SQA (Iyyer et al., 2017), even with only a subset of the training data.\n3. In Figure 4 we show examples in every group where our model is correct on the majority of the cases (across 9 trials), and the MASK-LM baseline is not. We also show examples that continue to produce errors after our pre-training. Many examples in this last group require multi-hop reasoning or complex numerical operations.\n4. We ran a study on column selection methods to speed-up training and inference. We found that we can speed up the model by a factor of 2 at a moderate drop in accuracy (\u2248 1 point) and by a factor of 4 at a larger drop but still with higher accuracy than previous approaches.\nWe characterized the complex operations required for table entailment to guide future research in this topic. Our code and models will be opensourced.\n5. Salient Groups To obtain detailed information of the improvements of our approach, we manually annotated 200 random examples with the complex operations needed to answer them. We found 4 salient groups: Aggregations, superlatives, com-paratives and negations, and sort pairs into these groups via keywords in the text. To make the groups exclusive, we add a fifth case when more than one operation is needed. The accuracy of the heuristics was validated through further manual inspection of 50 samples per group.\n6. Among the groups, the intermediate task data improve superlatives (39% error reduction) and negations (31%) most (Table 5). For example, we see that the accuracy is higher for superlatives than the for the overall validation set.\n7. For each group within the validation set, we look at the difference in accuracy between different models. We also look at how the total error rate is divided among the groups as a way to guide the focus on pre-training tasks and modeling. The error rate defined in this way measures potential accuracy gains if all the errors in a group S were fixed:\nER(S) = |{ Errors in S}| |{ Validation examples}| .\n8. We evaluate our model on the recently released TABFACT dataset . The tables are extracted from Wikipedia and the sentences written by crowd workers in two batches. The first batch consisted of simple sentences, that instructed the writers to refer to a single row in the table. The second one, created complex sentences by asking writers to use information from multiple rows.\n9. Some input examples from TABFACT can be too long for BERT-based models. We evaluate table pruning techniques as a pre-processing step to select relevant columns that respect the input example length limits. As described in section 2, an example is built by concatenating the statement with the flattened table. For large tables the example length can exceed the capacity limit of the transformer.\n10. TABFACT In Table 2 we find that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on TAB-FACT by more than 6 points (Base) or more than 9 points (Large). A model initialized only with the public TAPAS MASK-LM checkpoint is behind state-of-the-art by 2 points (71.7% vs 69.9%). If we train on the counterfactual data, it out-performs LOGICALFACTCHECKER and reaches 75.2% test accuracy (+5.3), slightly above using SQA.

The error rate defined in this way measures potential accuracy gains if all the errors in a group S were fixed:\nER(S) = |{ Errors in S}| |{ Validation examples}| .\n6. We introduced two pre-training tasks, counterfactual and synthetic, to obtain state-of-the-art results on the TABFACT  entailment task on tabular data. We adapted the BERT-based architecture of TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020) to binary classification and showed that pre-training on both tasks yields substantial improvements on TAB-FACT but also on a QA dataset, SQA (Iyyer et al., 2017), even with only a subset of the training data.\n7. We ran a study on column selection methods to speed-up training and inference. We found that we can speed up the model by a factor of 2 at a moderate drop in accuracy (\u2248 1 point) and by a factor of 4 at a larger drop but still with higher accuracy than previous approaches.\nWe characterized the complex operations required for table entailment to guide future research in this topic. Our code and models will be opensourced.\n8. * Released code & models to run TAPAS on [TabFact](https://tabfact.github.io/) for table entailment, companion for the EMNLP 2020 Findings paper [Understanding tables with intermediate pre-training](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.27/).\n * Added a [colab](http://tiny.cc/tapas-tabfact-colab) to try predictions on TabFact\n * Added [new page](https://github.com/google-research/tapas/blob/master/INTERMEDIATE_PRETRAIN_DATA.md) describing the intermediate pre-training process.\n9. TABFACT In Table 2 we find that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on TAB-FACT by more than 6 points (Base) or more than 9 points (Large). A model initialized only with the public TAPAS MASK-LM checkpoint is behind state-of-the-art by 2 points (71.7% vs 69.9%). If we train on the counterfactual data, it out-performs LOGICALFACTCHECKER and reaches 75.2% test accuracy (+5.3), slightly above using SQA. Only using the synthetic data is better (77.9%), and when using both datasets it achieves\n10. Some input examples from TABFACT can be too long for BERT-based models. We evaluate table pruning techniques as a pre-processing step to select relevant columns that respect the input example length limits. As described in section 2, an example is built by concatenating the statement with the flattened table. For large tables the example length can exceed the capacity limit of the transformer.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nWhat are recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact?\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact. If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact model, here are some recommendations regarding foreseeable issues:\n\n1. Model agreement and guessing: As mentioned in reference 1, there are questions around whether the model is just guessing the right answer for complex binary classification tasks like TABFACT. While counterfactual and synthetic pre-training improved agreement across model runs, only 55.5% agreed on the right answer in all cases. The model card should note this limitation and the potential for inconsistent or guessed outputs.\n\n2. Struggles with complex reasoning: Reference 2 notes that even after pre-training improvements, the model still produces errors on examples requiring multi-hop reasoning or complex numerical operations. The model card should clearly state these limitations so users understand the types of queries the model may struggle with.\n\n3. Speedup techniques impact accuracy: Reference 7 discusses using column selection methods to speed up training and inference by 2-4x. However, this comes with a moderate to large drop in accuracy. If these speedup techniques are used, the tradeoffs should be made clear in the model card.\n\n4. [More Information Needed] on model biases and failure modes across different types of tables and queries. The references focus mainly on overall accuracy and some specific linguistic phenomena, but a more thorough error analysis across a range of tabular data would help identify additional issues to document.\n\n5. [More Information Needed] on potential misuse cases and harms from a model designed to classify factual statements about tabular data. Depending on the intended use cases, there could be risks around using the model to spread misinformation or make decisions based on incorrect judgments.\n\nIn summary, the key issues to highlight are the model's inconsistency and potential to guess, struggles with complex reasoning, and accuracy tradeoffs when using speedup techniques. More analysis is needed on broader error patterns and misuse risks. Being transparent about these limitations in the model card is important for responsible open-sourcing."}

The tokenization steps are as follows:\n\n1. The input, consisting of a natural language question and a table, is first split into question tokens and table tokens separately.\n\n2. The question is tokenized using a WordPiece tokenizer, which breaks down the question into subword units. This helps in handling out-of-vocabulary words and reduces the overall vocabulary size.\n\n3. The table is linearized into a sequence of tokens. Each cell value in the table is treated as a separate token, and special tokens are added to indicate the structure of the table, such as:\n   - `[CLS]`: Represents the start of the input sequence.\n   - `[SEP]`: Separates the question tokens from the table tokens.\n   - `[MASK]`: Represents the masked token for masked language modeling during training.\n   - `[TAB]`, `[ROW]`, `[COL]`: Indicate the boundaries of tables, rows, and columns, respectively.\n   - `[CELL]`: Separates individual cell values within the table.\n\n4. The tokenized question and linearized table are concatenated to form the input sequence for the model, following the format: `[CLS] <question_tokens> [SEP] <table_tokens>`\n\n5. The input sequence is then converted into input IDs, where each token is mapped to its corresponding ID in the model's vocabulary.\n\n6. Additionally, segment IDs are created to distinguish between the question tokens and the table tokens. The question tokens are assigned a segment ID of 0, while the table tokens are assigned a segment ID of 1.\n\n7. The input IDs and segment IDs are then padded or truncated to a fixed sequence length, depending on the maximum sequence length supported by the model.\n\nThis tokenization process allows the TAPAS model to effectively process and understand the structure of the input, which consists of both natural language questions and tabular data. The special tokens help the model distinguish between different parts of the input and capture the relationships between the question and the table.", "The google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact model is fine-tuned on the TabFact dataset for table entailment tasks. The preprocessing steps for the input data of this model involve:\n\n1. Table linearization: The tables are flattened into a sequence of tokens, where each cell is represented by its corresponding value. Special tokens like [SEP] and [CLS] are added to separate cells and rows.\n\n2. Question encoding: The natural language question is tokenized and encoded using the TAPAS tokenizer, which is based on the BERT tokenizer. The question tokens are added to the linearized table sequence.\n\n3. Truncation and padding: The combined sequence of the linearized table and question is truncated to a maximum length of 512 tokens, which is the maximum input size for the TAPAS model. If the sequence is shorter than 512 tokens, it is padded with special [PAD] tokens to reach the required length.\n\n4. Position embeddings: Since the model needs to distinguish between table and question tokens, special position embeddings are added to the input sequence.

As a model fine-tuned on the TabFact dataset, it is designed to perform entailment and fact-checking tasks on structured tabular data.\n\nKey characteristics that will shape the model's behavior include:\n\n1. Tabular data format: The model expects input in the form of well-structured tables, typically containing numerical, categorical, or textual data. The model's performance may degrade when presented with unstructured or poorly formatted data.\n\n2. Domain-specific knowledge: The TabFact dataset covers a wide range of topics, but the model's performance may vary depending on the domain of the input data. It may perform better on topics well-represented in the training data and less effectively on novel or niche domains.\n\n3. Language and syntax: The model is trained on English-language data and will likely perform best on input adhering to standard English grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. Performance may be impacted when dealing with non-standard or domain-specific language.\n\n4. Fact-checking scope: The model is designed to assess the truthfulness of statements based on the information provided in the input table. Its ability to draw accurate conclusions may be limited when the relevant information is not explicitly present in the table or requires external knowledge.\n\n5. Table size and complexity: The model's performance may be affected by the size and complexity of the input tables. Very large or complex tables with intricate relationships between data points might pose challenges for the model.\n\nUnderstanding these domain and context characteristics is crucial for setting appropriate expectations and ensuring the model is applied to suitable tasks within its intended scope.", "The Google TAPAS (Table Parsing via Span Selection) model, specifically the tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact variant, is trained on the TabFact dataset to perform fact verification on tabular data. Given this training data and objective, some foreseeable population subgroup characteristics that may influence the model's behavior include:\n\n1. Language proficiency: The model is primarily trained on English language data, so its performance may vary for users with different levels of English proficiency or those using non-standard English dialects.\n\n2. Domain expertise: The TabFact dataset covers a wide range of topics, but the model's performance may be influenced by a user's domain expertise. Users with more knowledge in specific areas covered by the training data may be better equipped to interpret and validate the model's outputs.\n\n3. Familiarity with tabular data: Users who are more familiar with interpreting and working with tabular data, such as researchers, data analysts, or individuals in quantitative fields, may have a better understanding of the model's strengths and limitations when processing tables.\n\n4. Cultural background: The model's training data may contain cultural biases or assumptions that could affect how it behaves for users from different cultural backgrounds. Certain concepts, entities, or relationships represented in the tables may be more or less familiar to users depending on their cultural context.\n\n5. Accessibility needs: Users with visual impairments or other accessibility needs may require alternative methods to interact with the model's inputs (tables) and outputs, which could influence their experience and the model's effectiveness for them.\n\nIt's important to note that these are potential factors, and the actual influence on the model's behavior would require empirical evaluation across diverse user groups. Ongoing research and user feedback can help identify and mitigate any disparate impacts or biases in the model's performance.", "Based on the information provided in the question, there is no clear indication whether the evaluation of the Google Tapas large model fine-tuned on TabFact is disaggregated across various factors to uncover potential disparities in performance.

To comprehensively answer this question, one would need to refer to the model card or associated research papers that discuss how the model was evaluated and whether the evaluation considered different factors like table complexity, question types, subject domains, etc. to analyze performance disparities.

Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact model, here are some key characteristics that may influence the model's behavior:\n\nDomain and Context:\n- The model is trained and evaluated on the TABFACT dataset, which consists of statements that are either entailed or refuted by tables extracted from Wikipedia. So the model's performance is tied to this specific domain of Wikipedia tables and crowd-sourced statements about them.\n\nPopulation Subgroups:\n- The TABFACT dataset contains two batches of statements - simple sentences referring to a single table row, and complex sentences using information from multiple rows.

Disaggregated evaluation across these groups would help uncover performance disparities.\n- [More Information Needed] on other relevant population subgroups the model may perform differently on, such as based on table size, topic domain, numerical vs textual data, etc.\n\nOther Factors:\n- Table pruning techniques used as pre-processing to handle input length limits may affect model behavior on larger tables.\n- The pre-training tasks of generating synthetic and counterfactual statements have a significant impact on model accuracy.

Examining model outputs on these groups provides some interpretability of model strengths and weaknesses.\n\n- Reference 4 shows some specific examples where the model with intermediate pre-training is correct while the MASK-LM only model is not, as well as examples where the full model still makes errors, often on examples requiring multi-hop reasoning or complex numerical operations. Analyzing these individual examples provides insight into model capabilities and limitations.\n\nHowever, to make stronger claims about the model's explainability and interpretability, [More Information Needed] on topics like:\n\n- Visualizing model attention to see what table cells and question words the model focuses on for its predictions\n- Generating counterfactual examples (with small changes to the table or question) to test model robustness and error boundaries \n- Extracting learned representations to examine what features and concepts the model has captured\n- Applying attribution methods to determine what input features were important for individual predictions\n\nSo in summary, the intermediate pre-training analysis provides some useful insights, but additional explainability techniques could be applied to better understand the inner workings and decision making of the google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact model."}

The first one generates a sentence by sampling from a set of logical expressions that filter, combine and compare the information on the table, which is required in table entailment (e.g., knowing that Gerald Ford is taller than the average president requires summing all presidents and dividing by\n9. * Released code & models to run TAPAS on [TabFact](https://tabfact.github.io/) for table entailment, companion for the EMNLP 2020 Findings paper [Understanding tables with intermediate pre-training](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.27/).\n * Added a [colab](http://tiny.cc/tapas-tabfact-colab) to try predictions on TabFact\n * Added [new page](https://github.com/google-research/tapas/blob/master/INTERMEDIATE_PRETRAIN_DATA.md) describing the intermediate pre-training process.\n10. TABFACT In Table 2 we find that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on TAB-FACT by more than 6 points (Base) or more than 9 points (Large). A model initialized only with the public TAPAS MASK-LM checkpoint is behind state-of-the-art by 2 points (71.7% vs 69.9%). If we train on the counterfactual data, it out-performs LOGICALFACTCHECKER and reaches 75.2% test accuracy (+5.3), slightly above using SQA. Only using the synthetic data is better (77.9%), and when using both datasets it achieves\n11. Some input examples from TABFACT can be too long for BERT-based models. We evaluate table pruning techniques as a pre-processing step to select relevant columns that respect the input example length limits. As described in section 2, an example is built by concatenating the statement with the flattened table. For large tables the example length can exceed the capacity limit of the transformer.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the model architecture and objective about the model google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact.
