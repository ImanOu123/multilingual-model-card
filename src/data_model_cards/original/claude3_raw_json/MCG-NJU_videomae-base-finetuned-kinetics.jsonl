The model follows an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder is a Vision Transformer (ViT) that processes video frames and the decoder reconstructs the original video from the latent representations.\n\nKey aspects of the model architecture:\n\n1. Encoder: The encoder is a ViT that takes video frames as input and applies self-attention mechanisms to capture spatial and temporal dependencies. The input frames are divided into patches, which are then linearly projected and added with positional embeddings before being fed into the transformer layers.\n\n2. Masking: During training, a portion of the video patches are randomly masked, and the model is tasked with reconstructing the original video frames. This masking strategy encourages the model to learn meaningful representations of the video content.\n\n3. Decoder: The decoder takes the latent representations from the encoder and aims to reconstruct the original video frames. It consists of transformer layers that apply self-attention to the latent representations and generate the output video patches.\n\n4.

During pre-training, the model learns to reconstruct randomly masked video frames, enabling it to capture meaningful spatiotemporal representations.\n\nAfter the pre-training phase, the VideoMAE model is fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset for the specific task of video classification. The Kinetics dataset is a large-scale dataset consisting of hundreds of thousands of video clips, each labeled with one of several hundred human action classes. During fine-tuning, the pre-trained VideoMAE model is adapted to the Kinetics dataset by training it with labeled video clips using a supervised learning approach. The model's weights are updated to optimize its performance on the video classification task.\n\nThe fine-tuning process typically involves adding a classification head on top of the pre-trained VideoMAE model and training the entire model end-to-end using the labeled Kinetics dataset.

To figure out whether this inconsistent result is caused by the large scale of Something-Something V2, we further perform a detailed investigation by decreasing the pre-training video numbers. In this study, we run two experiments: (1) pre-training with the same epochs and (2)\n5. Kinetics-400. Our VideoMAE is pre-trained for 800 epochs on Kinetics-400 by default. During the fine-tuning phase, we perform the dense sampling following Slowfast [23]. For evaluation, all models share the same inference protocol, i.e., 5 clips \u00d7 3 crops. The default settings of pre-training and fine-tuning are shown in Table 9 and Table 12. For supervised training from scratch, we follow the recipe in [22] and train the model for 200 epochs.

Our VideoMAE takes the downsampled frames as inputs and uses the cube embedding to obtain video tokens. Then, we propose a simple design of tube masking with high ratio to perform MAE pre-training with an asymmetric encoderdecoder architecture. Our backbone uses the vanilla ViT with joint space-time attention.", "Tube masking with extremely high ratios. First, temporal redundancy is a factor affecting Video-MAE design. We find that VideoMAE is in favor of extremely high masking ratios (e.g. 90% to 95%) compared with the ImageMAE. Video information density is much lower than images, and we expect a high ratio to increase the reconstruction difficulty. This high masking ratio is helpful to mitigate the information leakage during masked modeling and make masked video reconstruction a meaningful self-supervised", "temporal neighbors of masked cubes are always masked. So for some cubes with no or small motion (e.g., finger cube in 4th row of Figure 2 (d)), we can not find the spatiotemporal corresponding content in all frames. In this way, it would encourage our VideoMAE to reason over high-level semantics to recover these totally missing cubes. This simple strategy can alleviate the information leakage for cubes with no or negligible motion, and turns out to be effective in practice for masked video pre-training.", "In this section, we first revisit ImageMAE [31]. Then we analyze the characteristics of video data. Finally, we show how we explore MAE in the video data by presenting our VideoMAE.", "Second, temporal correlation is another factor in our VideoMAE design.

To relieve the above issues in video masked modeling, we make the customized design in our VideoMAE, and the overall pipeline is shown in Figure 1. Our VideoMAE takes the downsampled frames as inputs and uses the cube embedding to obtain video tokens. Then, we propose a simple design of tube masking with high ratio to perform MAE pre-training with an asymmetric encoderdecoder architecture. Our backbone uses the vanilla ViT with joint space-time attention.\n2. Tube masking with extremely high ratios. First, temporal redundancy is a factor affecting Video-MAE design. We find that VideoMAE is in favor of extremely high masking ratios (e.g. 90% to 95%) compared with the ImageMAE. Video information density is much lower than images, and we expect a high ratio to increase the reconstruction difficulty. This high masking ratio is helpful to mitigate the information leakage during masked modeling and make masked video reconstruction a meaningful self-supervised\n3. temporal neighbors of masked cubes are always masked. So for some cubes with no or small motion (e.g., finger cube in 4th row of Figure 2 (d)), we can not find the spatiotemporal corresponding content in all frames. In this way, it would encourage our VideoMAE to reason over high-level semantics to recover these totally missing cubes. This simple strategy can alleviate the information leakage for cubes with no or negligible motion, and turns out to be effective in practice for masked video pre-training.\n4. In this section, we first revisit ImageMAE [31]. Then we analyze the characteristics of video data. Finally, we show how we explore MAE in the video data by presenting our VideoMAE.\n5. Second, temporal correlation is another factor in our VideoMAE design. We find even under the extremely high masking ratio, we can still improve the masking efficiency by proposing the temporal tube masking mechanism. Temporal tube masking enforces a mask to expand over the whole temporal axis, namely, different frames sharing the same masking map.

We import the necessary classes from the Hugging Face Transformers library.\n2. We load the feature extractor and the pre-trained VideoMAE model using the `from_pretrained()` method, specifying the model checkpoint \"MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics\".\n3. We assume that you have already loaded your video frames as a list of PIL images or NumPy arrays.\n4. We use the feature extractor to preprocess the video frames and convert them into the required input format for the model.\n5. We perform video classification by passing the preprocessed inputs to the model and obtaining the logits.\n6. We find the index of the predicted class by taking the argmax of the logits and map it to the corresponding class label using the `id2label` mapping provided by the model configuration.\n7.

In this appendix, we provide more details of VideoMAE from the following aspects:\n\u2022 The detailed architecture illustration is in \u00a7 6.\n\u2022 The implementation details are in \u00a7 7.\n\u2022 Experimental results are in \u00a7 8 where there are ablation studies on the Something-Something V2 and Kinectics-400 datasets, and a downstream evaluation task (i.e., action detection). More comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on the UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets are included as well. \u2022 Results analysis is in \u00a7 9.\n3. \u2022 Visualization of reconstructed samples is in \u00a7 10.\n\u2022 License of the datasets is in \u00a7 11.\n4. However, when we try to transfer the pre-trained VideoMAE models to the other video datasets (e.g. from Kinetics to Something-Something), the results are slightly worse than their counterpart, which is directly pre-trained on its own target video datasets. We argue that domain shift between pre-training and target datasets could be an important issue.    High masking ratio. In VideoMAE, one core design is the extremely high masking ratio. We perform an investigation of this design on the Kinetics-400 and\n5. Broader impact Potential negative societal impacts of VideoMAE are mainly concerned with energy consumption. The pre-training phase may lead to a large amount of carbon emission. Though the pre-training is energy-consuming, we only need to pre-train the model once. Different downstream tasks can then share the same pre-trained model via additional fine-tuning. Our VideoMAE unleashes the great potential of vanilla vision transformer for video analysis, which could increase the risk of video understanding\n6. gap on K400 is lower than one on SSV2. We argue that the Kinetics videos are mostly stationary and scene-related. The effect of temporal modeling is not obvious. Overall, we argue that our default designs enforce the networks to capture more useful spatiotemporal structures and therefore make VideoMAE a more challenging task, which a good self-supervised learner hunger for.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nHow the model may foreseeably be misused and address what users ought not do with the model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics. If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references, here are some potential misuses of the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model that users ought to avoid:\n\n- The model should not be used for tasks or on datasets that violate the licenses of the training data, which include custom licenses for Something-Something V2 and UCF101, and CC BY-NC 4.0 for Kinetics-400, HMDB51 and AVA. In particular, the non-commercial restriction of the CC BY-NC 4.0 license should be respected.\n\n- The model may not perform optimally when applied to video datasets that are very different from the Kinetics dataset it was fine-tuned on, due to domain shift issues. Users should be cautious about applying it to vastly different video domains without further validation.\n\n- [More Information Needed] on other specific ways the model could be intentionally misused or abused for harmful purposes.\n\nAdditionally, the energy-intensive pre-training of the model has environmental impact concerns in terms of carbon emissions. However, the shared pre-trained model amortizes this cost across many downstream applications.\n\nIn general, users should strive to use the model only for its intended video understanding purposes, respect dataset licenses, be mindful of potential domain shift limitations, and consider the computational resource implications. More specific guidance would require additional information on intended use cases and performance characteristics of the model."}

{"question": "bias_recommendations", "chain": "rev_retrieval", "prompt": ["When considering the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model, there are a few potential issues to keep in mind:\n\n1. Generalization: The model has been fine-tuned specifically on the Kinetics dataset, which consists of short video clips focusing on human actions. While it may perform well on similar datasets or tasks, its performance on videos with significantly different content or characteristics might be limited.\n\n2. Computational requirements: Video-based models generally require more computational resources compared to image-based models due to the additional temporal dimension. The MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model may have higher computational demands, which could limit its deployment in resource-constrained environments.\n\n3. Bias and fairness: Like any machine learning model, the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model may inherit biases present in the training data. If the Kinetics dataset contains biases or underrepresentation of certain demographics or actions, the model's predictions might reflect those biases.\n\n4. Robustness to adversarial attacks: The model's robustness to adversarial examples or perturbations in the input videos is an important consideration. Adversarial attacks specifically crafted to fool the model could potentially lead to incorrect predictions or misclassifications.\n\n5. Interpretability and explainability: Deep learning models, including the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model, can be challenging to interpret and explain. Understanding the model's decision-making process and the factors influencing its predictions may be difficult, which could hinder trust and accountability in certain applications.\n\nAddressing these potential issues would require careful evaluation, testing, and possibly additional techniques such as domain adaptation, model compression, bias mitigation, adversarial training, and interpretability methods to ensure the model's reliability and suitability for real-world deployment.", "When considering the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model, there are a few foreseeable issues and recommendations to keep in mind:\n\n1. Computational requirements: The model may require significant computational resources, such as high-end GPUs, to process and analyze video data effectively. Ensure that your system meets the necessary hardware requirements before deploying the model.\n\n2. Data quality and preprocessing: The performance of the model may be affected by the quality and preprocessing of the input video data. Ensure that the videos are of sufficient resolution, frame rate, and duration, and apply appropriate preprocessing techniques, such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation, to improve the model's performance.\n\n3. Domain adaptation: The model is fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset, which covers a wide range of human actions. However, if you intend to use the model for specific domains or applications, consider fine-tuning the model further on domain-specific data to improve its performance and generalization capabilities.\n\n4. Temporal context: The model may have limitations in capturing long-term temporal dependencies in videos. If your application requires understanding complex temporal relationships or long-range dependencies, consider using additional techniques, such as temporal attention mechanisms or recurrent neural networks, to enhance the model's temporal modeling capabilities.\n\n5. Interpretability and bias: Like many deep learning models, the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model may lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind its predictions. Additionally, the model may inherit biases present in the training data. Be aware of these limitations and consider using techniques for model interpretation and bias mitigation when necessary.\n\n6.

While pre-training only needs to be done once, it's important to consider ways to mitigate the environmental impact, such as using renewable energy sources or optimizing the training process for efficiency.\n\nPotential Misuse:\nVideoMAE's strong video understanding capabilities could potentially be misused for unethical purposes like surveillance overreach (reference 6). It's crucial to establish guidelines and safeguards around the model's use and deployment.\n\nDomain Shift and Generalization:\nThere are indications that domain shift between pre-training and target datasets can impact VideoMAE's performance when transferring to new datasets (reference 2, 5). More research is needed to improve the model's generalization and robustness to domain shifts.\n\nSmall Object Motion:\nVideoMAE may struggle to capture motion information from very small objects, possibly due to the high masking ratio (reference 8). Further investigation and potential improvements to the masking strategy could help address this limitation.\n\n[More Information Needed] on the specific pre-training dataset, model architecture details, and compute resources used, to provide more targeted recommendations.\n\nOverall, while VideoMAE shows promising results, it's important to carefully consider the ethical implications, environmental impact, and domain generalization challenges in its development and deployment.

We evaluate our VideoMAE on five common video datasets: Kinetics-400 [34], Something-Something V2 [26], UCF101 [61], HMDB51 [35], and AVA [27]. The Kinetics-400 contains around 240k training videos and 20k validation videos of 10s from 400 classes. The Something-Something V2 is another large-scale video dataset, having around 169k videos for training and 20k videos for validation.

We\n3. work on AVA, a dataset for spatiotemporal localization of human actions with 211k training and 57k validation video segments. In experiments of downstream tasks, we fine-tune the pre-trained VideoMAE models on the training set and report the results on the validation set. The implementation details are described in Appendix \u00a7 7.\n4.

The batch size and base learning rate are set to 192 and 3e-4, respectively. Here, 16 frames with a temporal stride of 4 are sampled. For fine-tuning, the model is trained with repeated augmentation [32] and a batch size of 128 for 100 epochs. The base learning rate, layer decay and drop path are set to 5e-4, 0.7 and 0.2, respectively. For evaluation, we adopt the\n7. Kinetics-400.

Compared with those large-scale video datasets, these two small datasets are more suitable for verifying the effectiveness of VideoMAE, as training large ViT models is more challenging on small datasets. Moreover, we also transfer the learned ViT models by VideoMAE to downstream action detection task. We\n8. work on AVA, a dataset for spatiotemporal localization of human actions with 211k training and 57k validation video segments. In experiments of downstream tasks, we fine-tune the pre-trained VideoMAE models on the training set and report the results on the validation set. The implementation details are described in Appendix \u00a7 7.\n9. categories. To better understand how the model works, we select several examples from validation set. The examples are shown in Figure 9. For the example in the 1st row, we find our VideoMAE might not capture the motion information from very small object. We suspect that tokens containing the small motion might all be masked due to our extremely high masking ratio, so our VideoMAE could hardly reconstruct the masked small motion pattern. For the example in the 2nd row, we find our VideoMAE could capture\n10. Kinetics-400.

More remarkably, when we scale up the pre-training configurations with larger video datasets (e.g. Kinetics-700) or more powerful backbones (e.g. ViT-Large and ViT-Huge), VideoMAE can finally obtain better performance. For example, our ViT-L VideoMAE pre-trained on Kinetics-700 achieves 39.3 mAP and ViT-H VideoMAE pre-trained on\n4. pre-training with the same time budget. The result is shown in Figure 4. We see that more training iterations could contribute to better performance when we decrease the size of the pre-training set. Surprisingly, even with only 42k pre-training videos, we can still obtain better accuracy than the Kinetics pre-trained models with 240k videos (68.7% vs. 68.5%). This result implies that domain shift is another important factor, and data quality is more important than data quantity in SSVP when there exists a\n5. Comparing Table 2 and Table 4, the transferred representation outperforms the original VideoMAE models trained from its own dataset on UCF101 and HMDB51. In contrast, the transferred representation is worse on Something-Something V2.

The implementation details are described in Appendix \u00a7 7.\n4. Temporal redundancy. There are frequently captured frames in a video. The semantics vary slowly in the temporal dimension [88]. We observe that consecutive frames are highly redundant, as shown in Figure 2. This property leads to two critical issues in masked video autoencoding. First, it would be less efficient to keep the original temporal frame rate for pre-training. This would draw us to focus more on static or slow motions in our masked modeling. Second, temporal redundancy greatly dilutes motion\n5. might guide the VideoMAE to learn low-level temporal correspondence rather than high-level information such as spatiotemporal reasoning over the content. To alleviate this behavior, we need to propose a new masking strategy to make the reconstruction more challenging and encourage effective learning of spatiotemporal structure representations.\n6. categories. To better understand how the model works, we select several examples from validation set. The examples are shown in Figure 9. For the example in the 1st row, we find our VideoMAE might not capture the motion information from very small object. We suspect that tokens containing the small motion might all be masked due to our extremely high masking ratio, so our VideoMAE could hardly reconstruct the masked small motion pattern. For the example in the 2nd row, we find our VideoMAE could capture\n7. Kinetics-400.

This implies that VideoMAE can capture more spatiotemporal structure representations (Reference 1). \n\nHowever, VideoMAE performs slightly worse on some categories. Looking at specific validation examples, it appears VideoMAE might not capture motion information well from very small objects, possibly because tokens containing small motion are all masked due to the high masking ratio (Reference 2).\n\nOn the other hand, VideoMAE can capture object deformation and movement in other examples that image pre-training cannot discriminate (Reference 5). Even under extremely high masking ratios, VideoMAE produces satisfying reconstructed results, implying it learns representative features that capture holistic spatiotemporal structure (References 3-4).\n\n[More Information Needed] on detailed interpretability analysis, e.g. visualizations of learned features, or attribution of predictions to input regions.

The ViT is a stack of self-attention layers that process the input video frames.\n\n2. Masking: During training, a portion of the video frames and patches within each frame are randomly masked.

The default choice for our model is colored in gray .\n5. Kinetics-400. Our VideoMAE is pre-trained for 800 epochs on Kinetics-400 by default. During the fine-tuning phase, we perform the dense sampling following Slowfast [23]. For evaluation, all models share the same inference protocol, i.e., 5 clips \u00d7 3 crops. The default settings of pre-training and fine-tuning are shown in Table 9 and Table 12. For supervised training from scratch, we follow the recipe in [22] and train the model for 200 epochs. Note that we adopt the repeated augmentation [32] during the\n6. UCF101. We follow a similar recipe on Kinetics for pre-training. Our VideoMAE is pre-trained with a masking ratio of 75% for 3200 epochs. The batch size and base learning rate are set to 192 and 3e-4, respectively. Here, 16 frames with a temporal stride of 4 are sampled. For fine-tuning, the model is trained with repeated augmentation [32] and a batch size of 128 for 100 epochs. The base learning rate, layer decay and drop path are set to 5e-4, 0.7 and 0.2, respectively. For evaluation, we adopt the\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the compute infrastructure about the model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics.
