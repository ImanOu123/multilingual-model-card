A2.1. SwinV2-B and SwinV2-L Settings ImageNet-22K pre-training Both models use an input image size (window size) of 192\u00d7192 (12\u00d712). We employ an AdamW optimizer [48] for 90 epochs using a cosine learning rate scheduler with 5-epoch linear warm-up. A batch size of 4096, an initial learning rate of 0.001, a weight decay of 0.1, and gradient clipping with a max norm of 5.0 are used. Augmentation and regularization strategies include RandAugment [15], Mixup [81], Cutmix [79], random erasing [84] and stochastic\n7. Larger models are more data hungry. To address the data hungry problem, previous large vision models typically utilize huge labelled data such as JFT-3B [17,56,80]. In this work, we exploit a self-supervised pre-training method, SimMIM [72], to alleviate the demands on labelled data. By this approach, we successfully trained a powerful Swin Transformer model of 3 billion parameters which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 4 representative visual benchmarks, by using only 70 million labelled images (1/40 of\n8. This section describes the experimental settings for ablation, including models of SwinV2-T, SwinV2-S, and SwinV2-B, and tasks of ImageNet-1K image classification, COCO object detection and ADE semantic segmentation.\n9. We have presented techniques for scaling Swin Transformer up to 3 billion parameters and making it capable of training with images of up to 1,536\u00d71,536 resolution, including the res-post-norm and scaled cosine attention to make the model easier to be scaled up in capacity, as well a log-spaced continuous relative position bias approach which lets the model more effectively transferred across window resolutions. The adapted architecture is named Swin Transformer V2, and by scaling up capacity and resolution,\n10. **Swin Transformer** (the name `Swin` stands for **S**hifted **win**dow) is initially described in [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030), which capably serves as a\ngeneral-purpose backbone for computer vision. It is basically a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is\ncomputed with shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention\ncomputation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection.\n11. SwinV2-L to the original SwinV1-B and SwinV1-L, respectively, where a +0.8% and +0.4% gains are observed. The shrunken gains by SwinV2-L than that of SwinV2-B may imply that if exceeding this size, more labeled data, stronger regularization, or advanced self-supervised learning methods are required.   [74]). This suggests that scaling up vision model is beneficial for the dense vision recognition task of object detection. Our approach can use a different window size at test to additionally benefit,\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide basic details about the model microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft.

This model has been trained on a large dataset and has learned general features and representations that can be applied to different tasks.\n\nTo use the model without fine-tuning, you can leverage the pre-trained weights and extract features from the model's intermediate layers. These features can then be used as input to other machine learning models or algorithms for tasks such as image classification, object detection, or image retrieval.\n\nFor example, you can pass an image through the pre-trained model and extract the features from the last layer before the classification head. These features can be treated as a compact representation of the image and used as input to a separate classifier or clustering algorithm. This approach allows you to benefit from the model's learned representations without the need to fine-tune the entire model for your specific task.\n\nUsing the model without fine-tuning can be particularly useful when you have limited labeled data or computational resources for training. It allows you to leverage the knowledge learned by the model during its pre-training phase and apply it to your specific use case.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while using the model without fine-tuning can provide good results, fine-tuning the model on your specific task and dataset can often lead to better performance, especially if your data differs significantly from the data the model was originally trained on.", "The model microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft is a fine-tuned version of the Swin Transformer V2 architecture, which is designed for image classification tasks. This model can be used without any post-processing steps due to its end-to-end training approach.\n\nTo utilize this model, you simply need to pass an input image through the model, and it will directly output the predicted class probabilities. The class with the highest probability is considered the model's prediction for the given image. Since the model has been fine-tuned on a specific dataset (as indicated by the \"ft\" suffix in the model name), it has learned to map input images to their corresponding classes during the training process.\n\nThe model's architecture, which includes patch embedding, window-based self-attention, and a classification head, allows it to extract relevant features from the input image and make predictions in a single forward pass. This eliminates the need for additional post-processing steps, such as feature extraction or classifier training, making it convenient to use for image classification tasks.\n\nIn summary, the microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft model can be used directly for image classification without any post-processing, as it has been fine-tuned to predict class probabilities given an input image.", "The model \"microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft\" is a pre-trained vision transformer model that can be used for various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. To use this model without plugging it into a pipeline, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Load the pre-trained model using the transformers library:\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor, AutoModelForImageClassification\n\nmodel_name = \"microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft\"\nfeature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)\n```\n\n2. Preprocess your input image using the feature extractor:\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nimage = Image.open(\"path/to/your/image.jpg\")\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n```\n\n3. Pass the preprocessed input through the model to obtain predictions:\n```python\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\n```\n\n4. Interpret the model's output, such as predicted class probabilities or labels:\n```python\npredicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()\npredicted_class = model.config.id2label[predicted_class_idx]\nprint(f\"Predicted class: {predicted_class}\")\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can use the \"microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft\" model for inference on your own images without the need for a pipeline. This approach allows for more flexibility and customization in your computer vision applications.", "The model \"microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft\" is a large-scale vision transformer model developed by Microsoft. It is based on the Swin Transformer architecture and has been fine-tuned on a dataset ranging from 22k to 1k images with varying patch sizes and window sizes.\n\nTo use this model for image classification tasks, you can leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python. Here's a code snippet demonstrating how to load and use the model:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor, SwinForImageClassification\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Load the feature extractor and model\nfeature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft\")\nmodel = SwinForImageClassification.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft\")\n\n# Load and preprocess the image\nimage = Image.open(\"path/to/your/image.jpg\")\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Perform image classification\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\npredicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()\nprint(\"Predicted class index:\", predicted_class_idx)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n\n1. We import the necessary classes from the Transformers library: `AutoFeatureExtractor` for preprocessing the input image and `SwinForImageClassification` for loading the Swin Transformer model.\n\n2. We load the feature extractor and the pre-trained model using the `from_pretrained()` method, specifying the model name \"microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft\".\n\n3. We load the image using PIL's `Image.open()` method, providing the path to your image file.\n\n4. We preprocess the image using the loaded feature extractor, which converts the image into the required input format for the model.\n\n5. We pass the preprocessed image to the model using the `model()` function, which returns the model's output.\n\n6. We extract the logits from the model's output, which represent the unnormalized predictions for each class.\n\n7. We find the index of the predicted class by taking the argmax of the logits along the last dimension.\n\n8. Finally, we print the predicted class index.\n\nNote that you may need to install the necessary dependencies (`transformers` and `pillow`) before running the code.\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to use the \"microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft\" model for image classification tasks using the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python."]}

To save experimental time, we only employ SwinV2-G for large-scale experiments. SwinV2-H is employed for another parallel study about self-supervised learning [72].\n4. \u2022 Sequential self-attention computation. To train large models on very large resolutions, for example, an image of 1,536\u00d71,536 resolution with a window size of 32\u00d732, regular A100 GPUs (40GB memory) are still unaffordable, even with the above two optimization technologies. We found that in this case, the selfattention module constitutes a bottleneck. To alleviate this problem, we implement self-attention computation sequentially, instead of using the previous batch computation approach. This optimization\n5. \u2022 Activation check-pointing [12]. Feature maps in the Transformer layers also consume a lot of GPU memory, which can create bottlenecks when image and window resolutions are high. The activation checkpointing technology can significantly reduce the memory consumption, while the training speed is up to 30% slower.\n6. residual-post-norm method combined with cosine attention to improve training stability; 2) A log-spaced continuous position bias method to effectively transfer models pre-trained using low-resolution images to downstream tasks with high-resolution inputs; 3) A self-supervised pretraining method, SimMIM, to reduce the needs of vast labeled images. Through these techniques, this paper successfully trained a 3 billion-parameter Swin Transformer V2 model, which is the largest dense vision model to date, and\n7. Larger models are more data hungry. To address the data hungry problem, previous large vision models typically utilize huge labelled data such as JFT-3B [17,56,80]. In this work, we exploit a self-supervised pre-training method, SimMIM [72], to alleviate the demands on labelled data. By this approach, we successfully trained a powerful Swin Transformer model of 3 billion parameters which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 4 representative visual benchmarks, by using only 70 million labelled images (1/40 of\n8. SwinV2-L to the original SwinV1-B and SwinV1-L, respectively, where a +0.8% and +0.4% gains are observed. The shrunken gains by SwinV2-L than that of SwinV2-B may imply that if exceeding this size, more labeled data, stronger regularization, or advanced self-supervised learning methods are required.   [74]). This suggests that scaling up vision model is beneficial for the dense vision recognition task of object detection. Our approach can use a different window size at test to additionally benefit,\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nExplain how the model microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft can be used without fine-tuning, post-processing, or plugging into a pipeline.

There is a risk of the model memorizing and exposing private information.\n\n- Potential for misuse in surveillance, tracking or identifying individuals without permission if the model enables classification or detection of people. This could enable privacy violations and oppressive targeting of groups.\n\n- Possible safety issues if the model is applied in high-stakes domains like medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, etc. and the model makes errors leading to harm. Extensive testing for robustness and worst-case performance would be critical.\n\n- Environmental costs of training such a large model in terms of computational resources and electricity contributing to carbon emissions. The benefits should be weighed against this impact.\n\nResponsible development and deployment of the model with clear use case restrictions, safety checks, transparency around training data/methods, and proactive assessment of risks is important to mitigate potential harms.

This appears to be a specific computer vision model developed by Microsoft, likely based on the Swin Transformer architecture.\n\nHowever, some general misunderstandings that could potentially arise from using such a model include:\n\n1. Overestimating the model's capabilities: Users might assume that the model can accurately understand and interpret all images, while in reality, it may have limitations or biases.\n\n2. Lack of context understanding: The model might struggle with understanding the broader context or meaning behind an image, as it primarily focuses on visual patterns and features.\n\n3. Biases in training data: If the training data used for the model contains biases, the model's outputs may reflect those biases, potentially leading to misinterpretations or unfair results.\n\n4. Adversarial attacks: Like many computer vision models, this model might be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted input images can cause the model to make incorrect predictions.\n\nTo get a more accurate understanding of the specific misunderstandings associated with this model, it would be best to refer to the official documentation or research papers related to the \"microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft\" model.", "The microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft model is a large vision transformer model fine-tuned for image classification.

This may limit its practical deployment.\n- As a supervised learning model, it is limited by the data it was trained on. It may not generalize well to image domains or tasks that are very different from its training data. \n- Its architecture is specialized for classification, so adapting it to other computer vision tasks like object detection or segmentation would require significant modifications.\n- Like other deep learning models, it can be susceptible to adversarial examples - images that are intentionally designed to fool the model.\n- Lack of interpretability and explainability of the model's learned representations and decision-making process.\n\nMore analysis and empirical testing would be needed to characterize its specific limitations, failure modes, and intended use cases.

Some potential sociotechnical limitations include:\n\n- The model was trained on a dataset of 1.8 million images, which while large, may not fully represent the diversity of real-world imagery. This could lead to biases or blind spots in what the model is able to recognize.\n\n- As a supervised learning model, it is limited to classifying images into the predefined categories it was trained on. It lacks more general visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.\n\n- The model may be prone to making confident predictions even on out-of-distribution images quite different from its training data. Careful testing is needed to understand its failure modes and limitations.\n\n- As a large deep learning model, its decision-making process is not easily interpretable or explainable. This opacity could be an issue in high-stakes applications.\n\n- Broad deployment of such models has environmental costs in terms of the computational resources and energy required to train and run them at scale.\n\nFurther empirical studies would help to better characterize the specific limitations and potential negative impacts of this model.

Computational requirements: As a large model, it may require significant computational resources, such as powerful GPUs or TPUs, to train and deploy effectively. This could limit its accessibility and usability for some users or organizations with limited computing power.\n\n2. Overfitting: With its high capacity, the model might be prone to overfitting, especially if the training data is limited or not representative of the target domain. This could lead to poor generalization performance on unseen data.\n\n3. Interpretability: Like many deep learning models, the Swin Transformer V2 architecture may lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how the model arrives at its predictions. This could be a concern in applications where explainability is crucial, such as in healthcare or finance.\n\n4. Domain adaptation: The model's performance may degrade when applied to domains or tasks that differ significantly from its pre-training data. Fine-tuning the model on target domain data can help mitigate this issue, but it may still require substantial effort and resources.\n\n5. Bias: If the training data contains biases, the model may inherit and even amplify these biases in its predictions. It is essential to carefully curate the training data and monitor the model's outputs for potential biases.\n\nWhile these issues are worth considering, the Swin Transformer V2 architecture has shown impressive performance across various vision tasks, and the Microsoft model is likely to be a valuable resource for many applications with the proper implementation and monitoring.", "When considering the use of the model microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft, it is important to be aware of potential issues and follow recommendations to mitigate them.

Scaling up model capacity and window resolution: The original Swin Transformer faced issues with exploding activation values in deeper layers when scaled up to larger sizes (References 2, 8). The res-post-norm and scaled cosine attention techniques introduced in Swin Transformer V2 help mitigate this issue and stabilize training for larger models (References 1, 2, 3). However, it's important to monitor and validate the model's behavior as it is scaled up further.\n\n2. Transferring models across window resolutions: The original Swin Transformer showed degraded performance when transferring pre-trained models to larger image resolutions and window sizes (Reference 9). The log-spaced continuous relative position bias approach in Swin Transformer V2 aims to address this issue and improve transferability (References 1, 4). However, it's recommended to thoroughly test and validate the model's performance when transferring across different resolutions.\n\n3. Ethical considerations: [More Information Needed] The provided references do not discuss ethical considerations or potential misuse of the model.\n\n4.

The preprocessing of the data for this model involves the following tokenization steps:\n\n1. Patch Extraction: The input images are divided into non-overlapping patches of size 4x4 pixels. This is indicated by the \"patch4\" in the model name. These patches serve as the basic units for further processing.\n\n2. Window Attention: The model employs a window attention mechanism, where the patches are grouped into windows of varying sizes. The \"window12to16\" in the model name suggests that the window sizes range from 12x12 to 16x16 patches. This allows the model to capture both local and global dependencies within the image.\n\n3. Image Resizing: The input images are resized to a resolution range of 192x192 to 256x256 pixels, as indicated by the \"192to256\" in the model name. This resizing step ensures that the images have a consistent size before being processed by the model.\n\n4. Pretraining Dataset: The model is pretrained on a large-scale dataset, which is a combination of the ImageNet-22K and ImageNet-1K datasets. The \"22kto1k\" in the model name refers to this pretraining dataset. The ImageNet-22K dataset contains approximately 14 million images across 22,000 classes, while the ImageNet-1K dataset is a subset of ImageNet-22K with 1,000 classes.\n\n5. Fine-tuning: After pretraining on the ImageNet-22K and ImageNet-1K datasets, the model undergoes fine-tuning, as indicated by the \"ft\" suffix in the model name. Fine-tuning involves training the model on a specific downstream task or dataset to adapt its knowledge to the target domain.\n\nDuring the tokenization process, the input images are transformed into a sequence of tokens, where each token represents a patch of the image. The window attention mechanism operates on these tokens, allowing the model to capture dependencies at different scales. The resizing step ensures consistent input dimensions, while the pretraining on the ImageNet-22K and ImageNet-1K datasets provides a strong foundation for the model's visual understanding. Finally, fine-tuning allows the model to specialize in a specific task or domain.", "The model microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft is a vision transformer model that has been fine-tuned for image classification tasks. As part of the preprocessing pipeline, the input images undergo resizing to ensure they match the expected dimensions of the model.\n\nSpecifically, the images are resized to a resolution ranging from 192x192 to 256x256 pixels. This resizing step is crucial because the model architecture expects input images within this size range. By scaling the images to these dimensions, the model can effectively process and analyze the visual information.\n\nThe resizing process maintains the aspect ratio of the original images to prevent distortion. If the aspect ratio of an image does not match the target resolution, padding is applied to preserve the original proportions. The padding is typically done using a constant value, such as black or white pixels, to fill the extra space around the resized image.\n\nIt's important to note that the resizing operation is performed dynamically during the data loading and preprocessing phase, rather than modifying the original image files. This allows for efficient memory usage and enables the model to handle images of various sizes and aspect ratios.\n\nBy resizing the input images to the appropriate dimensions, the microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft model can effectively process and extract meaningful features from the visual data, enabling accurate image classification."]}

We maintain the stage, block, and channel settings of the original Swin Transformer for 4 configurations of Swin Transformer V2:\n\u2022 SwinV2-T: C = 96, #. block = {2, 2, 6, 2} \u2022 SwinV2-S/B/L: C=96/128/192, #.block={2, 2, 18, 2}\nwith C the number of channels in the first stage.\nWe further scale up Swin Transformer V2 to its huge size and giant size, with 658 million parameters and 3 billion parameters, respectively:\n\u2022 SwinV2-H: C = 352, #. block = {2, 2, 18, 2}\n4. \u2022 Activation check-pointing [12]. Feature maps in the Transformer layers also consume a lot of GPU memory, which can create bottlenecks when image and window resolutions are high. The activation checkpointing technology can significantly reduce the memory consumption, while the training speed is up to 30% slower.\n5. \u2022 Sequential self-attention computation. To train large models on very large resolutions, for example, an image of 1,536\u00d71,536 resolution with a window size of 32\u00d732, regular A100 GPUs (40GB memory) are still unaffordable, even with the above two optimization technologies. We found that in this case, the selfattention module constitutes a bottleneck. To alleviate this problem, we implement self-attention computation sequentially, instead of using the previous batch computation approach. This optimization\n6. \u2022 Zero-Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) [54]. In a general data-parallel implementation of optimizers, the model parameters and optimization states are broadcasted to every GPU. This implementation is very unfriendly on GPU memory consumption, for example, a model of 3 billion parameters will consume 48G GPU memory when an AdamW optimizer and fp32 weights/states are used. With a ZeRO optimizer, the model parameters and the corresponding optimization states will be split and distributed to multiple GPUs, which\n7. Issues in scaling up model capacity and window resolution We observe two issues when we scale up the capacity and window resolution of the Swin Transformer. Table 1. Comparison of different position bias computation approaches using Swin-T. * indicates the top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k trained from scratch. The models in * column will be used for testing on the ImageNet-1K image classification task using larger image/window resolutions, marked by \u2020. For these results, we report both the results w.o./with\n8. We have presented techniques for scaling Swin Transformer up to 3 billion parameters and making it capable of training with images of up to 1,536\u00d71,536 resolution, including the res-post-norm and scaled cosine attention to make the model easier to be scaled up in capacity, as well a log-spaced continuous relative position bias approach which lets the model more effectively transferred across window resolutions. The adapted architecture is named Swin Transformer V2, and by scaling up capacity and resolution,\n9. \u2022 Degraded performance when transferring models across window resolutions. As shown in the first row of Table 1, the accuracy decreases significantly when we directly test the accuracy of a pre-trained ImageNet-1K model (256 \u00d7 256 images with 8 \u00d7 8 window size) at larger image resolutions and window sizes through the bi-cubic interpolation approach. It may be worth re-examining the relative position bias approach in the original Swin Transformer.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide detail throughput, start or end time, checkpoint sizes, etc. about the model microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft.

Image domains: The model is trained on a diverse dataset of 22k to 1k images, which likely covers a wide range of image domains. However, its performance may vary depending on the specific domain of the input image and how well it aligns with the training data.\n\n3. Patch size and window size: The model uses a patch size of 4x4 and a window size ranging from 12x12 to 16x16. These architectural choices affect how the model processes and attends to different regions of the input image, which can impact its ability to capture fine-grained details or global context.\n\n4. Fine-tuning: The \"ft\" in the model name suggests that it has been fine-tuned, likely on a more specific dataset or task. The characteristics of this fine-tuning dataset and task will influence the model's behavior and performance on related inputs.\n\n5. Object scales: The model's ability to detect and recognize objects at different scales may be affected by the range of object sizes present in its training data and the receptive field of its architecture.\n\nUnderstanding these domain and context characteristics can help users select the appropriate model for their specific use case and anticipate potential limitations or biases in the model's behavior.", "The behavior of the model microsoft/swinv2-large-patch4-window12to16-192to256-22kto1k-ft is likely to be influenced by various population subgroup characteristics, primarily related to the diversity and representation within the training data.

For our largest model experiments, we employ an additional detection pre-training phase using Object 365 v2 dataset [59], in-between the image classification pretraining phase and the COCO fine-tuning\n6. In the following paragraphs, we report the accuracy of SwinV2-G on representative vision benchmarks. Note that since our main goal is to explore how to feasibly scale up model capacity and window resolution, and whether the vision tasks can benefit from significantly larger capacity, we did not particularly align complexities or pre-training data in comparisons.\n7. Issues in scaling up model capacity and window resolution We observe two issues when we scale up the capacity and window resolution of the Swin Transformer. Table 1.
