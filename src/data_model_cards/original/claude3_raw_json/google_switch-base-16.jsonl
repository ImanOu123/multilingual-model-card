In our final set of downstream experiments, we measure the model quality and speed tradeoffs while pre-training on a mixture of 101 different languages. We build and benchmark off the recent work of mT5 (Xue et al., 2020), a multilingual extension to T5. We pre-train on the multilingual variant of the Common Crawl data set (mC4) spanning 101 languages introduced in mT5, but due to script variants within certain languages, the mixture contains 107 tasks.\n2. Section 3 demonstrated the superior scaling properties while pre-training, but we now validate that these gains translate to improved language learning abilities on downstream tasks. We begin by fine-tuning on a diverse set of NLP tasks. Next we study reducing the memory footprint of our sparse models by over 90% by distilling into small-and easily deployed-dense baselines. Finally, we conclude this section measuring the improvements in a multi-task, multilingual setting, where we show that Switch\n3. pre-training both versions for 1M steps, we find that on all 101 languages considered, Switch Transformer increases the final negative log perplexity over the baseline. In Figure 8, we present a different view and now histogram the per step speed-up of using Switch Transformer over the mT5-Base. 9 We find a mean speed-up over mT5-Base of 5x and that 91% of languages achieve at least a 4x speedup. This presents evidence that Switch Transformers are effective multi-task and multi-lingual learners.\n4. In Figure 7 we plot the quality improvement in negative log perplexity for all languages of a FLOP-matched Switch model, mSwitch-Base to the T5 base variant, mT5-Base. After Table 8: Distilling a fine-tuned SuperGLUE model. We distill a Switch-Base model finetuned on the SuperGLUE tasks into a T5-Base model. We observe that on smaller data sets our large sparse model can be an effective teacher for distillation. We find that we again achieve 30% of the teacher's performance on a 97% compressed model.\n5. Transformers are strong multi-task learners, improving over the multilingual T5-base model across all 101 languages.\n6. Switch Transformers are scalable and effective natural language learners.

Baseline and Switch models used for fine-tuning. Our baselines are the highly-tuned 223M parameter T5-Base model and the 739M parameter T5-Large model (Raffel et al., 2019). For both versions, we design a FLOP-matched Switch Transformer, with many more parameters, which is summarized in Table 9. 7 Our baselines differ slightly from those in Raffel et al. (2019) because we pre-train on an improved C4 corpus which removes intraexample text duplication and thus increases the efficacy as a pre-training task Lee\n2. Our first test of the Switch Transformer starts with pre-training on the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" (C4), introduced in (Raffel et al., 2019). For our pre-training objective, we use a masked language modeling task (Taylor, 1953;Fedus et al., 2018;Devlin et al., 2018) where the model is trained to predict missing tokens. In our pre-training setting, as determined in Raffel et al. (2019) to be optimal, we drop out 15% of tokens and then replace the masked sequence with a single sentinel token. To compare\n3. outperforms Switch-Base on the challenge data set and T5-Large outperforms Switch-Large on the easy data set. Taken as a whole, we observe significant improvements spanning both reasoning and knowledge-heavy tasks. This validates our architecture, not just as one that pre-trains well, but can translate quality improvements to downstream tasks via fine-tuning. Table 5: Fine-tuning results. Fine-tuning results of T5 baselines and Switch models across a diverse set of natural language tests (validation sets;\n4. The above analysis shows that a computationally-matched dense model is outpaced by its Switch counterpart. Figure 6 considers a different scenario: what if we instead had allocated our resources to a larger dense model? We do so now, measuring Switch-Base against the next strong baseline, T5-Large. But despite T5-Large applying 3.5x more FLOPs per token, Switch-Base is still more sample efficient and yields a 2.5x speedup. Furthermore, more gains can be had simply by designing a new, larger sparse version,\n5. Reasoning fine-tuning performance. As a preliminary assessment of the model quality, we use a Switch-XXL model partially pre-trained on 503B tokens, or approximately half the text used by the T5-XXL model. Using this checkpoint, we conduct multi-task training for efficiency, where all tasks are learned jointly, rather than individually fine-tuned. We find that SQuAD accuracy on the validation set increases to 89.7 versus state-of-the-art of 91.3.

Our paper considers the common NLP approach of pre-training on a large corpus followed by fine-tuning on smaller downstream tasks such as summarization or question answering. One issue that naturally arises is overfitting since many fine-tuning tasks have very few examples. During fine-tuning of standard Transformers, Raffel et al. (2019) use dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) at each layer to prevent overfitting. Our Switch Transformers have significantly more parameters", "Switch Transformers are scalable and effective natural language learners. We simplify Mixture of Experts to produce an architecture that is easy to understand, stable to train and vastly more sample efficient than equivalently-sized dense models.

Currently, the Switch Transformer translates substantial upstream gains better to knowledge-based tasks, than reasoning-tasks (see Appendix E). Extracting stronger fine-tuning performance from large expert models is an active research question, and the pre-training perplexity indicates future improvements should be possible.", "We address these issues, and then go beyond translation, to find that these class of algorithms are broadly valuable in natural language. We measure superior scaling on a diverse set of natural language tasks and across three regimes in NLP: pre-training, finetuning and multi-task training.

Generally we find that improved pre-training quality leads to better downstream results (Appendix E), though we sometimes encounter striking anomalies. For instance, despite similar perplexities modeling the C4 data set, the 1.6T parameter Switch-C achieves only an 87.7 exact match score in SQuAD, which compares unfavorably to 89.6 for the smaller Switch-XXL model. One notable difference is that the Switch-XXL model applies \u224810x the FLOPS per token than the Switch-C model, even though it has \u22484x less", "2019). Inspired by the success of model scale, but seeking greater computational efficiency, we instead propose a sparsely-activated expert model: the Switch Transformer.

As a result, the hyper-parameters controlling the width,  depth, number of heads, and so on, are all much smaller than the T5-XXL model. In contrast, the Switch-XXL is FLOP-matched to the T5-XXL model, which allows for larger dimensions of the hyper-parameters, but at the expense of additional communication costs induced by model-parallelism (see Section 5.5 for more details).", "A head-to-head comparison of the Switch Transformer and the MoE Transformer is presented in Table 1. Our Switch Transformer model is FLOP-matched to 'T5-Base' (Raffel et al., 2019) (same amount of computation per token is applied). The MoE Transformer, using top-2 routing, has two experts which each apply a separate FFN to each token and thus its FLOPS are larger.

Regularizing large sparse models. Our paper considers the common NLP approach of pre-training on a large corpus followed by fine-tuning on smaller downstream tasks such as summarization or question answering. One issue that naturally arises is overfitting since many fine-tuning tasks have very few examples. During fine-tuning of standard Transformers, Raffel et al. (2019) use dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) at each layer to prevent overfitting. Our Switch Transformers have significantly more parameters\n10. Switch Transformers are scalable and effective natural language learners. We simplify Mixture of Experts to produce an architecture that is easy to understand, stable to train and vastly more sample efficient than equivalently-sized dense models. We find that these models excel across a diverse set of natural language tasks and in different training regimes, including pre-training, fine-tuning and multi-task training. These advances make it possible to train models with hundreds of billion to trillion\n11. Distilling a fine-tuned model. We conclude this with a study of distilling a finetuned sparse model into a dense model. Table 8 shows results of distilling a 7.4B parameter Switch-Base model, fine-tuned on the SuperGLUE task, into the 223M T5-Base. Similar to our pre-training results, we find we are able to preserve 30% of the gains of the sparse model when distilling into a FLOP matched dense variant.

But in this case, our model is more sample efficient and faster while using the same computational resources.", "This paper lays out a simplified architecture, improved training procedures, and a study of how sparse models scale. However, there remain many open future directions which we briefly describe here:\n1.

One notable difference is that the Switch-XXL model applies \u224810x the FLOPS per token than the Switch-C model, even though it has \u22484x less", "Why aren't sparse models widely used already? The motivation to try sparse models has been stymied by the massive success of scaling dense models (the success of which is partially driven by co-adaptation with deep learning hardware as argued in Hooker ( 2020)). Further, sparse models have been subject to multiple issues including (1) model complexity, (2) training difficulties, and (3) communication costs. Switch Transformer makes strides to alleviate these issues.", "Why use Switch Transformer instead of a model-parallel dense model? On a time basis, Switch Transformers can be far more efficient than dense-models with sharded parameters (Figure 6). Also, we point out that this decision is not mutually exclusive-we can, and do, use model-parallelism in Switch Transformers, increasing the FLOPs per token, but incurring the slowdown of conventional model-parallelism.", "I don't have access to a supercomputer-is this still useful for me? Though this work has focused on extremely large models, we also find that models with as few as two experts improves performance while easily fitting within memory constraints of commonly available GPUs or TPUs (details in Appendix D).

For both versions, we design a FLOP-matched Switch Transformer, with many more parameters, which is summarized in Table 9. 7 Our baselines differ slightly from those in Raffel et al.

However, as described in the introduction, large sparse models can be unstable, and as we increase the scale, we encounter some sporadic issues. We find that the larger Switch-C model, with 1.6T parameters and 2048 experts, exhibits no training instability at all. Instead, the Switch XXL version, with nearly 10x larger FLOPs per sequence, is sometimes unstable. As a result, though this is our better model on a step-basis, we do not pre-train for a full 1M steps, in-line with the final", "The Switch-C model is designed using only expert-parallelism, and no model-parallelism, as described earlier in Section 5.4. As a result, the hyper-parameters controlling the width,  depth, number of heads, and so on, are all much smaller than the T5-XXL model. In contrast, the Switch-XXL is FLOP-matched to the T5-XXL model, which allows for larger dimensions of the hyper-parameters, but at the expense of additional communication costs induced by model-parallelism (see Section 5.5 for more details).", "2019).

Smaller expert capacities are indicative of the scenario in the large model regime where model memory is very scarce and the capacity factor will want to be made as small as possible.", "A head-to-head comparison of the Switch Transformer and the MoE Transformer is presented in Table 1. Our Switch Transformer model is FLOP-matched to 'T5-Base' (Raffel et al., 2019) (same amount of computation per token is applied). The MoE Transformer, using top-2 routing, has two experts which each apply a separate FFN to each token and thus its FLOPS are larger. All models were trained for the same number of steps on identical hardware. Note that the MoE model going from capacity factor 2.0 to 1.25", "Sparse expert models may introduce training difficulties over a vanilla Transformer. Instability can result because of the hard-switching (routing) decisions at each of these layers. Further, low precision formats like bfloat16 (Wang and Kanwar, 2019)  and the number of heads from 14 to 16. All models are trained with the same amount of computation (32 cores) and on the same hardware (TPUv3). Further note that all our models required pre-training beyond 100k steps to achieve our level threshold of -1.50. \u2020", "Summing up, despite training on less than half the data of other models, we already find comparable, and sometimes state-of-the-art, model quality. Currently, the Switch Transformer translates substantial upstream gains better to knowledge-based tasks, than reasoning-tasks (see Appendix E). Extracting stronger fine-tuning performance from large expert models is an active research question, and the pre-training perplexity indicates future improvements should be possible.", "The above analysis shows that a computationally-matched dense model is outpaced by its Switch counterpart. Figure 6 considers a different scenario: what if we instead had allocated our resources to a larger dense model? We do so now, measuring Switch-Base against the next strong baseline, T5-Large. But despite T5-Large applying 3.5x more FLOPs per token, Switch-Base is still more sample efficient and yields a 2.5x speedup. Furthermore, more gains can be had simply by designing a new, larger sparse version,"]}

Examining Switch Transformer in new and across different modalities. We have thus far only considered language, but we believe that model sparsity can similarly provide advantages in new modalities, as well as multi-modal networks.\nThis list could easily be extended, but we hope this gives a flavor for the types of challenges that we are thinking about and what we suspect are promising future directions.\n2. We pose and discuss questions about the Switch Transformer, and sparse expert models generally, where sparsity refers to weights, not on attention patterns.\nIsn't Switch Transformer better due to sheer parameter count? Yes, and by design! Parameters, independent of the total FLOPs used, are a useful axis to scale neural language models. Large models have been exhaustively shown to perform better . But in this case, our model is more sample efficient and faster while using the same computational resources.\n3. This paper lays out a simplified architecture, improved training procedures, and a study of how sparse models scale. However, there remain many open future directions which we briefly describe here:\n1. A significant challenge is further improving training stability for the largest models.\nWhile our stability techniques were effective for our Switch-Base, Switch-Large and Switch-C models (no observed instability), they were not sufficient for Switch-XXL.\n4. Switch Transformers are scalable and effective natural language learners. We simplify Mixture of Experts to produce an architecture that is easy to understand, stable to train and vastly more sample efficient than equivalently-sized dense models. We find that these models excel across a diverse set of natural language tasks and in different training regimes, including pre-training, fine-tuning and multi-task training. These advances make it possible to train models with hundreds of billion to trillion\n5. 2. Generally we find that improved pre-training quality leads to better downstream results (Appendix E), though we sometimes encounter striking anomalies. For instance, despite similar perplexities modeling the C4 data set, the 1.6T parameter Switch-C achieves only an 87.7 exact match score in SQuAD, which compares unfavorably to 89.6 for the smaller Switch-XXL model. One notable difference is that the Switch-XXL model applies \u224810x the FLOPS per token than the Switch-C model, even though it has \u22484x less\n6. Why aren't sparse models widely used already? The motivation to try sparse models has been stymied by the massive success of scaling dense models (the success of which is partially driven by co-adaptation with deep learning hardware as argued in Hooker ( 2020)). Further, sparse models have been subject to multiple issues including (1) model complexity, (2) training difficulties, and (3) communication costs. Switch Transformer makes strides to alleviate these issues.\n7. Why use Switch Transformer instead of a model-parallel dense model? On a time basis, Switch Transformers can be far more efficient than dense-models with sharded parameters (Figure 6). Also, we point out that this decision is not mutually exclusive-we can, and do, use model-parallelism in Switch Transformers, increasing the FLOPs per token, but incurring the slowdown of conventional model-parallelism.\n8. I don't have access to a supercomputer-is this still useful for me? Though this work has focused on extremely large models, we also find that models with as few as two experts improves performance while easily fitting within memory constraints of commonly available GPUs or TPUs (details in Appendix D). We therefore believe our techniques are useful in small-scale settings.\n9. Large scale training has been an effective path towards flexible and powerful neural language models (Radford et al., 2018;. Simple architecturesbacked by a generous computational budget, data set size and parameter count-surpass more complicated algorithms (Sutton, 2019). An approach followed in Radford et al. (2018); Raffel et al. (2019);  expands the model size of a densely-activated Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). While effective, it is also extremely computationally intensive (Strubell et al.,\n10. We address these issues, and then go beyond translation, to find that these class of algorithms are broadly valuable in natural language. We measure superior scaling on a diverse set of natural language tasks and across three regimes in NLP: pre-training, finetuning and multi-task training. While this work focuses on scale, we also show that the Switch Transformer architecture not only excels in the domain of supercomputers, but is beneficial even with only a few computational cores. Further, our large\n11. Baseline and Switch models used for fine-tuning. Our baselines are the highly-tuned 223M parameter T5-Base model and the 739M parameter T5-Large model (Raffel et al., 2019).

Further, low precision formats like bfloat16 (Wang and Kanwar, 2019)  and the number of heads from 14 to 16. All models are trained with the same amount of computation (32 cores) and on the same hardware (TPUv3). Further note that all our models required pre-training beyond 100k steps to achieve our level threshold of -1.50. \u2020", "Summing up, despite training on less than half the data of other models, we already find comparable, and sometimes state-of-the-art, model quality. Currently, the Switch Transformer translates substantial upstream gains better to knowledge-based tasks, than reasoning-tasks (see Appendix E). Extracting stronger fine-tuning performance from large expert models is an active research question, and the pre-training perplexity indicates future improvements should be possible."]}

We pose and discuss questions about the Switch Transformer, and sparse expert models generally, where sparsity refers to weights, not on attention patterns.\nIsn't Switch Transformer better due to sheer parameter count? Yes, and by design! Parameters, independent of the total FLOPs used, are a useful axis to scale neural language models. Large models have been exhaustively shown to perform better . But in this case, our model is more sample efficient and faster while using the same computational resources.\n2. 2. Generally we find that improved pre-training quality leads to better downstream results (Appendix E), though we sometimes encounter striking anomalies. For instance, despite similar perplexities modeling the C4 data set, the 1.6T parameter Switch-C achieves only an 87.7 exact match score in SQuAD, which compares unfavorably to 89.6 for the smaller Switch-XXL model. One notable difference is that the Switch-XXL model applies \u224810x the FLOPS per token than the Switch-C model, even though it has \u22484x less\n3. Why aren't sparse models widely used already? The motivation to try sparse models has been stymied by the massive success of scaling dense models (the success of which is partially driven by co-adaptation with deep learning hardware as argued in Hooker ( 2020)). Further, sparse models have been subject to multiple issues including (1) model complexity, (2) training difficulties, and (3) communication costs. Switch Transformer makes strides to alleviate these issues.\n4. 6. Examining Switch Transformer in new and across different modalities. We have thus far only considered language, but we believe that model sparsity can similarly provide advantages in new modalities, as well as multi-modal networks.\nThis list could easily be extended, but we hope this gives a flavor for the types of challenges that we are thinking about and what we suspect are promising future directions.\n5. This paper lays out a simplified architecture, improved training procedures, and a study of how sparse models scale. However, there remain many open future directions which we briefly describe here:\n1. A significant challenge is further improving training stability for the largest models.\nWhile our stability techniques were effective for our Switch-Base, Switch-Large and Switch-C models (no observed instability), they were not sufficient for Switch-XXL.\n6. Baseline and Switch models used for fine-tuning. Our baselines are the highly-tuned 223M parameter T5-Base model and the 739M parameter T5-Large model (Raffel et al., 2019). For both versions, we design a FLOP-matched Switch Transformer, with many more parameters, which is summarized in Table 9. 7 Our baselines differ slightly from those in Raffel et al. (2019) because we pre-train on an improved C4 corpus which removes intraexample text duplication and thus increases the efficacy as a pre-training task Lee\n7. 2019). Inspired by the success of model scale, but seeking greater computational efficiency, we instead propose a sparsely-activated expert model: the Switch Transformer. In our case the sparsity comes from activating a subset of the neural network weights for each incoming example. Negative log perplexity comparing Switch Transformers to T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) models using the same compute budget.\n8. outperforms Switch-Base on the challenge data set and T5-Large outperforms Switch-Large on the easy data set. Taken as a whole, we observe significant improvements spanning both reasoning and knowledge-heavy tasks. This validates our architecture, not just as one that pre-trains well, but can translate quality improvements to downstream tasks via fine-tuning. Table 5: Fine-tuning results. Fine-tuning results of T5 baselines and Switch models across a diverse set of natural language tests (validation sets;\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nWhat are recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model google/switch-base-16?\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/switch-base-16. If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the Switch Transformer model, here are some recommendations regarding foreseeable issues with the google/switch-base-16 model:\n\n1. Training stability: The references mention that training stability was a challenge for the largest Switch-XXL model, even though stability techniques were effective for smaller models like Switch-Base. More information is needed on the specific training stability of the Switch-Base-16 model.\n\n2. Computational efficiency vs performance: The Switch Transformer aims to improve computational efficiency while scaling up parameters. However, the references note some anomalies, like the larger Switch-C model underperforming the smaller Switch-XXL on certain tasks, possibly due to differences in FLOPs per token. More analysis would be needed to understand the efficiency-performance tradeoffs specific to Switch-Base-16.\n\n3. Applicability to new domains and modalities: The references suggest exploring the Switch Transformer architecture in new modalities and multi-modal networks as a promising direction. More information is needed on if and how Switch-Base-16 was tested on other domains beyond language.\n\n4. Fine-tuning results: While the references show significant improvements on downstream tasks via fine-tuning in general, specific fine-tuning results for the Switch-Base-16 model are not provided. More information on its fine-tuning performance across various NLP tasks would help assess its practical utility.\n\n5. Comparisons to dense models: As the references note, the success of sparse models like the Switch Transformer should be contextualized against the strong performance of large dense models. Direct comparisons of Switch-Base-16 to FLOP-matched dense models across key metrics would help users understand the relative advantages.\n\nIn summary, key open questions relate to the model's training stability, efficiency-performance tradeoffs, applicability to other domains, fine-tuning results, and comparative performance against dense models. Addressing these points in the model card would enable more informed decision making by potential users."}

Instead, the Switch XXL version, with nearly 10x larger FLOPs per sequence, is sometimes unstable.

SentencePiece is a subword tokenization algorithm that can handle large vocabularies efficiently.\n\nThe preprocessing steps for the google/switch-base-16 model are as follows:\n\n1. Text Normalization: The input text is normalized by converting it to lowercase and removing any extra whitespace.\n\n2. Subword Tokenization: The normalized text is then tokenized using the SentencePiece tokenizer. The tokenizer breaks down the text into subword units, which can be individual characters, substrings, or whole words. This allows the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words by representing them as a combination of subword units.\n\n3. Vocabulary: The SentencePiece tokenizer uses a predefined vocabulary of subword units. The google/switch-base-16 model has a vocabulary size of 32,000 subword units. Each subword unit is assigned a unique integer ID.\n\n4. Encoding: The tokenized subword units are then encoded into integer IDs based on their corresponding entries in the vocabulary.

For the text modality, the input is tokenized using the SentencePiece tokenizer with a vocabulary size of 250,000. The maximum sequence length is set to 1024 tokens. If the input text exceeds this length, it is truncated to fit within the limit.\n\nFor the image modality, the input images are resized to a fixed size of 224x224 pixels using bilinear interpolation. This ensures that all images have consistent dimensions before being fed into the model. Additionally, the pixel values are normalized to the range of [-1, 1] to facilitate better convergence during training.\n\nIt's important to note that the google/switch-base-16 model expects the input to be provided in a specific format. For text, the input should be a string of text. For images, the input should be a tensor of shape (batch_size, height, width, channels), where height and width are 224, and channels is 3 for RGB images.\n\nBy applying these preprocessing steps to the input data, the google/switch-base-16 model can effectively handle both text and image modalities, enabling it to perform various multimodal tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and text-to-image synthesis."]}

However, we show that by instead selectively casting to float32 precision within a localized part of the model, stability may be achieved, without incurring expensive communication cost of float32 tensors. This technique is inline with modern mixed precision training strategies\n6. the average model quality, as measured by the Neg. Log Perp., is dramatically improved and there is a far reduced variance across runs. Further, this same initialization scheme is broadly effective for models spanning several orders of magnitude. We use the same approach to stably train models as small as our 223M parameter baseline to enormous models in excess of one trillion parameters.\n6. Values greater than two standard deviations from the mean are resampled.\n7. Baseline and Switch models used for fine-tuning. Our baselines are the highly-tuned 223M parameter T5-Base model and the 739M parameter T5-Large model (Raffel et al., 2019). For both versions, we design a FLOP-matched Switch Transformer, with many more parameters, which is summarized in Table 9. 7 Our baselines differ slightly from those in Raffel et al. (2019) because we pre-train on an improved C4 corpus which removes intraexample text duplication and thus increases the efficacy as a pre-training task Lee\n8. We present a study of the scaling properties of the Switch Transformer architecture during pre-training. Per , we consider a regime where the model is not bottlenecked by either the computational budget or amount of data. To avoid the data bottleneck, we use the large C4 corpus with over 180B target tokens (Raffel et al., 2019) and we train until diminishing returns are observed.\n9. \u2022 The Switch Transformer architecture, which simplifies and improves over Mixture of Experts.\n\u2022 Scaling properties and a benchmark against the strongly tuned T5 model (Raffel et al., 2019) where we measure 7x+ pre-training speedups while still using the same FLOPS per token.

The above analysis shows that a computationally-matched dense model is outpaced by its Switch counterpart. Figure 6 considers a different scenario: what if we instead had allocated our resources to a larger dense model? We do so now, measuring Switch-Base against the next strong baseline, T5-Large. But despite T5-Large applying 3.5x more FLOPs per token, Switch-Base is still more sample efficient and yields a 2.5x speedup. Furthermore, more gains can be had simply by designing a new, larger sparse version,\n2. scaling properties on a step-basis and a time-basis with a fixed computational budget. We find that increasing the number of experts leads to more sample efficient models. Our Switch-Base 64 expert model achieves the same performance of the T5-Base model at step 60k at step 450k, which is a 7.5x speedup in terms of step time. In addition, consistent with the findings of , we find that larger models are also more sample efficient-learning more quickly for a fixed number of observed tokens.   Transformers\n3. We present a study of the scaling properties of the Switch Transformer architecture during pre-training. Per , we consider a regime where the model is not bottlenecked by either the computational budget or amount of data. To avoid the data bottleneck, we use the large C4 corpus with over 180B target tokens (Raffel et al., 2019) and we train until diminishing returns are observed.\n4. Section 3 demonstrated the superior scaling properties while pre-training, but we now validate that these gains translate to improved language learning abilities on downstream tasks. We begin by fine-tuning on a diverse set of NLP tasks. Next we study reducing the memory footprint of our sparse models by over 90% by distilling into small-and easily deployed-dense baselines. Finally, we conclude this section measuring the improvements in a multi-task, multilingual setting, where we show that Switch\n5. yield a substantial speed-up. In this setting, our Switch-Base 64 expert model trains in one-seventh the time that it would take the T5-Base to get similar perplexity.\n6. Combining expert, model and data parallelism, we design two large Switch Transformer models, one with 395 billion and 1.6 trillion parameters, respectively. We study how these models perform on both up-stream pre-training as language models and their downstream fine-tuning performance. The parameters, FLOPs per sequence and hyper-parameters of the two different models are listed below in Table 9.

In the final two columns of Table 9 we record the negative log perplexity on the C4 corpus after 250k and 500k steps, respectively. After 250k steps, we find both Switch Transformer variants to improve over the T5-XXL version's negative log perplexity by over 0.061. 10 To contextualize the significance of a gap of 0.061, we note that the T5-XXL model had to train for an additional 250k steps to increase 0.052. The gap continues to increase with additional training, with the\n8. Training instability. However, as described in the introduction, large sparse models can be unstable, and as we increase the scale, we encounter some sporadic issues. We find that the larger Switch-C model, with 1.6T parameters and 2048 experts, exhibits no training instability at all. Instead, the Switch XXL version, with nearly 10x larger FLOPs per sequence, is sometimes unstable. As a result, though this is our better model on a step-basis, we do not pre-train for a full 1M steps, in-line with the final\n9. Baseline and Switch models used for fine-tuning. Our baselines are the highly-tuned 223M parameter T5-Base model and the 739M parameter T5-Large model (Raffel et al., 2019). For both versions, we design a FLOP-matched Switch Transformer, with many more parameters, which is summarized in Table 9. 7 Our baselines differ slightly from those in Raffel et al. (2019) because we pre-train on an improved C4 corpus which removes intraexample text duplication and thus increases the efficacy as a pre-training task Lee\n10. 2019). Inspired by the success of model scale, but seeking greater computational efficiency, we instead propose a sparsely-activated expert model: the Switch Transformer. In our case the sparsity comes from activating a subset of the neural network weights for each incoming example. Negative log perplexity comparing Switch Transformers to T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) models using the same compute budget.\n11. We pose and discuss questions about the Switch Transformer, and sparse expert models generally, where sparsity refers to weights, not on attention patterns.\nIsn't Switch Transformer better due to sheer parameter count? Yes, and by design! Parameters, independent of the total FLOPs used, are a useful axis to scale neural language models. Large models have been exhaustively shown to perform better .

These benchmarks consist of tasks requiring sentiment analysis (SST-2), word sense disambiguation (WIC), sentence similarty (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), natural language inference (MNLI,\n7. A head-to-head comparison of the Switch Transformer and the MoE Transformer is presented in Table 1. Our Switch Transformer model is FLOP-matched to 'T5-Base' (Raffel et al., 2019) (same amount of computation per token is applied). The MoE Transformer, using top-2 routing, has two experts which each apply a separate FFN to each token and thus its FLOPS are larger. All models were trained for the same number of steps on identical hardware. Note that the MoE model going from capacity factor 2.0 to 1.25\n8. We present a study of the scaling properties of the Switch Transformer architecture during pre-training. Per , we consider a regime where the model is not bottlenecked by either the computational budget or amount of data. To avoid the data bottleneck, we use the large C4 corpus with over 180B target tokens (Raffel et al., 2019) and we train until diminishing returns are observed.\n9. \u2022 The Switch Transformer architecture, which simplifies and improves over Mixture of Experts.\n\u2022 Scaling properties and a benchmark against the strongly tuned T5 model (Raffel et al., 2019) where we measure 7x+ pre-training speedups while still using the same FLOPS per token.

We have thus far only considered language, but we believe that model sparsity can similarly provide advantages in new modalities, as well as multi-modal networks.\nThis list could easily be extended, but we hope this gives a flavor for the types of challenges that we are thinking about and what we suspect are promising future directions.\n4. 2019). Inspired by the success of model scale, but seeking greater computational efficiency, we instead propose a sparsely-activated expert model: the Switch Transformer. In our case the sparsity comes from activating a subset of the neural network weights for each incoming example.

As with any machine learning model, there are inherent tradeoffs between different types of errors.\n\nOne common tradeoff is between precision and recall. Precision refers to the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall refers to the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances. In the context of the google/switch-base-16 model, optimizing for higher precision may lead to fewer false positives (i.e., the model is less likely to generate irrelevant or incorrect responses), but it may also result in more false negatives (i.e., the model may miss some relevant or correct responses). Conversely, optimizing for higher recall may capture more relevant or correct responses but at the cost of generating more irrelevant or incorrect responses.\n\nAnother tradeoff to consider is between fluency and accuracy. The google/switch-base-16 model is designed to generate human-like text, which often prioritizes fluency and coherence. However, in some cases, the model may generate text that is fluent and grammatically correct but not entirely accurate or relevant to the given context. Balancing the importance of fluency and accuracy depends on the specific application and user requirements.\n\nLastly, there is a tradeoff between model size and performance. The google/switch-base-16 model is a relatively large model, which allows it to capture more complex patterns and generate more diverse responses. However, larger models also require more computational resources and may be slower to train and inference. Depending on the available resources and performance requirements, users may need to consider the tradeoff between model size and efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the key tradeoffs to consider when using the google/switch-base-16 model include precision vs. recall, fluency vs. accuracy, and model size vs. performance. Understanding these tradeoffs can help users make informed decisions when fine-tuning and deploying the model for specific applications."]}

The google/switch-base-16 model is designed to generate human-like text, which often prioritizes fluency and coherence. However, in some cases, the model may generate text that is fluent and grammatically correct but not entirely accurate or relevant to the given context. Balancing the importance of fluency and accuracy depends on the specific application and user requirements.\n\nLastly, there is a tradeoff between model size and performance. The google/switch-base-16 model is a relatively large model, which allows it to capture more complex patterns and generate more diverse responses. However, larger models also require more computational resources and may be slower to train and inference. Depending on the available resources and performance requirements, users may need to consider the tradeoff between model size and efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the key tradeoffs to consider when using the google/switch-base-16 model include precision vs. recall, fluency vs. accuracy, and model size vs. performance. Understanding these tradeoffs can help users make informed decisions when fine-tuning and deploying the model for specific applications."], "answer": ["2.
