BigBird introduces several key modifications to the standard transformer architecture:\n\n1. Sparse attention: Instead of attending to all tokens in the sequence, BigBird uses a combination of global, random, and local attention patterns. This allows the model to capture both local and global dependencies while reducing computational complexity.\n\n2. Longer sequence lengths: BigBird can handle sequences of up to 4096 tokens, which is significantly longer than the typical 512 tokens limit in many transformer models.\n\n3. Pre-training: The model is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data using the RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) methodology, which includes dynamic masking and larger batch sizes.\n\nThe \"large\" version of the BigBird-RoBERTa model has 24 layers, 16 attention heads, and a hidden size of 1024, resulting in approximately 340 million parameters.

The exact size of the training dataset is not publicly disclosed, but it is assumed to be in the range of hundreds of billions of tokens.\n\nDuring the pre-training phase, the model was trained using a combination of masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) tasks. In MLM, a portion of the input tokens is randomly masked, and the model learns to predict the original tokens based on the surrounding context. NSP involves predicting whether two given sentences follow each other in the original text.\n\nThe model was trained using large-scale distributed computing infrastructure and advanced optimization techniques to handle the computational requirements of training such a large model. The training process likely involved techniques such as gradient accumulation, mixed-precision training, and efficient parallelization across multiple GPUs or TPUs.\n\nAfter the pre-training phase, the google/bigbird-roberta-large model can be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks, such as question answering, text classification, or language generation, using task-specific training data.

Its responses should not be taken as definitive truth without verification.\n\n2. The model has no real-world knowledge beyond its training data cutoff date in 2020. It cannot provide information on current events after that time period.\n\n3. As an AI system, the model has no true understanding, emotions, or moral compass.

In our notation, this corresponds to creating a new matrix B \u2208 [0, 1] (N +g)\u00d7(N +g) by adding g rows to matrix A, such that B(i, :) = 1, and B(:, i) = 1 for all i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . g}, and B(g + i, g + j) = A(i, j)\u2200 i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , N }. This adds extra location to store context and as we will see in the experiments improves\n5. The final attention mechanism for BIGBIRD (Fig. 1d) has all three of these properties: queries attend to r random keys, each query attends to w/2 tokens to the left of its location and w/2 to the right of its location and they contain g global tokens (The global tokens can be from existing tokens or extra added tokens). We provide implementation details in App. D.\n6. We use four publicly available datasets Books [110], CC-News [34], Stories [89] and Wikipedia to pretrain BIGBIRD. We borrow the sentencepiece vocabulary as RoBERTa (which is in turn borrowed from GPT2). We split any document longer than 4096 into multiple documents and we join documents that were much smaller than 4096. Following the original BERT training, we mask 15% of tokens in these four datasets, and train to predict the mask. We warm start from RoBERTa's checkpoint. We train two different models:\n7. Pretraining and MLM We follow [22,63] to create base and large versions of BIGBIRD and pretrain it using MLM objective. This task involves predicting a random subset of tokens which have been masked out. We use four standard data-sets for pretraining (listed in App. E.1, Tab. 9), warm-starting from the public RoBERTa checkpoint 2 . We compare performance in predicting the masked out tokens in terms of bits per character, following [8]. As seen in App. E.1, Tab. 10, both BIGBIRD and Longformer perform\n8. better than limited length RoBERTa, with BIGBIRD-ETC performing the best. We note that we trained our models on a reasonable 16GB memory/chip with batch size of 32-64. Our memory efficiency is due to efficient blocking and sparsity structure of the sparse attention mechanism described in Sec. 2.\n9. Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BIGBIRD, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BIGBIRD is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these\n10.

Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having O(1) global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BIGBIRD drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide basic details about the model google/bigbird-roberta-large.

Our model parameters are b = 64, g = 2 \u00d7 b, w = 3 \u00d7 b, r = 3 \u00d7 b ( we used the BIGBIRD-ITC base model pretrained on MLM task). We compare the performance of BIGBIRD to BERT, XLNet [101] and RoBERTa in Tab. 16. We find that even\n6. We use four publicly available datasets Books [110], CC-News [34], Stories [89] and Wikipedia to pretrain BIGBIRD. We borrow the sentencepiece vocabulary as RoBERTa (which is in turn borrowed from GPT2). We split any document longer than 4096 into multiple documents and we join documents that were much smaller than 4096. Following the original BERT training, we mask 15% of tokens in these four datasets, and train to predict the mask. We warm start from RoBERTa's checkpoint. We train two different models:\n7.

For example, if you want to use the model for sentiment analysis, you can create a prompt like: \"Classify the sentiment of the following text: [input text]. Sentiment: [positive/negative/neutral]\". The model will then process the prompt and generate a response based on its understanding of the task and the input text.\n\nThis approach can be applied to a wide range of tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, and more.

This eliminates the need for complex post-processing pipelines, as the model can directly output the required information.\n\nFor example, if you want to use the model for sentiment analysis, you can fine-tune it on a labeled dataset containing positive and negative sentiment examples.

This step converts the text into a sequence of numerical tokens that the model can understand. You can then pass the tokenized input to the model's forward pass, which will generate the model's output embeddings.\n\nThese output embeddings can be further processed or fed into custom layers depending on your specific task, such as text classification, named entity recognition, or question answering. You can add your own layers on top of the pre-trained model to fine-tune it for your desired task.\n\nBy using the google/bigbird-roberta-large model directly, you have more flexibility and control over the model's usage compared to using a pre-defined pipeline.

This data may contain biases, misinformation, and problematic content that could be reflected in the model's outputs. [More Information Needed] on specific risks.\n- As a large language model, BigBird may be misused to generate fake news, spam, hateful/offensive text if prompted. Appropriate safeguards are needed.\n\nTechnical limitations: \n- BigBird uses sparse attention to scale to longer sequences (4096 tokens), but theoretical analysis shows sparse attention cannot universally replace dense attention. Some tasks provably require \u03a9(n) layers with sparse attention vs O(1) with dense (full) attention.\n- Scaling limitations still exist beyond 4096 tokens. BigBird enables 8x longer context than previous models on similar hardware, but further efficiency improvements are needed.\n\nSociotechnical limitations:\n- BigBird was evaluated on academic NLP benchmarks like GLUE, but real-world use cases may reveal additional robustness and fairness issues. [More Information Needed] \n- As a large pretrained model, BigBird has high compute costs for finetuning and inference. This could lead to inequitable access.

Continuously monitor the model's performance and be prepared to update or retrain it as needed.\n\n5. Ethical considerations: Large language models like BigBird-RoBERTa-Large have the potential to generate biased or inappropriate content. It is important to carefully review and filter the model's outputs to ensure they align with ethical guidelines and do not perpetuate harmful biases. Implement appropriate safeguards and content moderation mechanisms when deploying the model in real-world applications.\n\nBy keeping these recommendations in mind and addressing the foreseeable issues, you can effectively leverage the google/bigbird-roberta-large model for your specific use case while ensuring responsible and efficient deployment."], "answer": ["GLUE The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark [92], test language models on 8 different natural language understanding tasks.

The impossibility for sparse-attention follows from hardness results stemming from Orthogonal Vector Conjecture (OVC) [2,1,96,7], which is a widely used assumption in fine-grained complexity.

Complementing the above positive results, we also show that moving to a sparse-attention mechanism incurs a cost, i.e. there is no free lunch. In Sec. 3.4, we show lower bounds by exhibiting a natural task where any sufficiently sparse mechanism will require polynomially more layers.\n6. In this section, we will show that that sparse attention mechanisms are as powerful and expressive as full-attention mechanisms in two respects. First, we show that when sparse attention mechanisms are used in a standalone encoder (such as BERT), they are Universal Approximators of sequence to sequence functions in the style of Yun et al. [104]. We note that this property was also explored theoretically in contemporary work Yun et al. [105].

Finding vectors that are furthest apart boils down to minimize inner product search in case of unit vectors. For a full-attention mechanism with appropriate query and keys, this task is very easy as we can evaluate all pair-wise inner products.\n8.

If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the BIGBIRD model, here are some recommendations regarding foreseeable issues with google/bigbird-roberta-large:\n\n1. Sparse attention mechanisms like those used in BIGBIRD cannot universally replace dense attention mechanisms without tradeoffs. There are certain tasks that require \u03a9(n) layers for sparse attention with \u00d5(n) edges to solve, while full attention can solve in O(1) layers. This suggests BIGBIRD may require more layers and computation for certain problem types compared to dense attention. [References 1, 2, 4, 5]\n\n2. [More Information Needed] on the specific downstream tasks and datasets google/bigbird-roberta-large was evaluated on. The references mention GLUE benchmark results for a BIGBIRD-base model, but not the -large variant. More information is needed on the large model's performance. [Reference 8]\n\n3. The ability for BIGBIRD to handle longer sequence lengths up to 8x previous limits is noted as a benefit that improves various NLP task performance. However, [More Information Needed] on any potential negative consequences or failure modes that may arise from significantly increasing the context window. [Reference 10]\n\n4. [More Information Needed] on the pretraining data and methodology used for google/bigbird-roberta-large specifically. The references mention pretraining datasets and procedures for BIGBIRD models in general, but not the exact setup for this particular large variant. [Reference 9]\n\nIn summary, while BIGBIRD enables longer context and shows promising results, the use of sparse attention may require more layers for certain tasks compared to dense attention. More specific information is needed on the large model variant's pretraining setup, downstream evaluation, and potential issues that may arise from its extended sequence length. I recommend conducting further analyses and benchmarks to better understand the model's capabilities and limitations."}

Following the observation from RoBERTa, we pretrain on a larger batch size of 2048 for this size. For BIGBIRD-ITC the block length was kept same as base size, but for BIGBIRD-ETC the block length was almost doubled to 169. All the remaining parameters were the same.\n4. -10% of the time tokens are left unchanged, but are still predicted at output. We run this entire sequence through the BIGBIRD transformer encoder and then predict corresponding to the masked positions, based on the context provided by the other non-masked tokens in the sequence. . For 50% of the time the second sequence comes from true sequence after the first one. Remaining 50% of the time it is a a random sequence from the full dataset. The model is then required to predict this relationship using the\n5. \u2022 Masked Language Model (MLM): In order to train a deep bidirectional representation, BERT training introduces the MLM task, where we simply mask out 15% of the input tokens at random, and then predict those masked tokens. We can simply replace such masked out of the tokens with a [MASK] placeholder, but it leads to a distribution mis-match for downstream tasks which will not have such placeholders. To mitigate with this issue, out of the 15% of the tokens selected for masking:\n6. Next we run sentencepiece [50] tokenization on the resulting documents. In particular, using 5 characters as the building blocks (four for bases -A, T, C, G and one for missing symbol N), we construct a byte pair encoding table of size 32k, with each token representing 8.78 base pairs on average.\nUsing the above constructed documents, we construct a dataset for two pretraining tasks following Devlin et al. [22]:\n7. As a result we propose to first blockify the attention pattern i.e. we pack sets of query and keys together and then define attention on these blocks. It is easier to explain this process using the example shown in Fig. 3. Suppose, there are 12 query and 12 key vectors to attend to. Using a block size of 2, we split the query matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks and similarly the key matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks. Then the three different building components of BIGBIRD are defined on the block matrix. In particular\n8. We try to keep the experimental setup as close to a typical NLP pipeline. In this regard, we take human reference GRCh37 7 and convert it into documents D. Each document d \u2208 D is a sequence of sentences, where each sentence is a sequence of fragments of DNA. We construct the documents as follows:\n9. GLUE The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark [92], test language models on 8 different natural language understanding tasks. We used the same training parameters as mentioned in https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/ examples/roberta/README.glue.md. Our model parameters are b = 64, g = 2 \u00d7 b, w = 3 \u00d7 b, r = 3 \u00d7 b ( we used the BIGBIRD-ITC base model pretrained on MLM task). We compare the performance of BIGBIRD to BERT, XLNet [101] and RoBERTa in Tab. 16. We find that even\n10. BigBird, is a sparse-attention based transformer which extends Transformer based models, such as BERT to much longer sequences. Moreover, BigBird comes along with a theoretical understanding of the capabilities of a complete transformer that the sparse model can handle.\n\nAs a consequence of the capability to handle longer context,\nBigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization.\n11. - pretrained BERT model for base(`bigbr_base`) and large (`bigbr_large`) size. It correspond to BERT/RoBERTa-like encoder only models. Following original BERT and RoBERTa implementation they are transformers with post-normalization, i.e. layer norm is happening after the attention layer. However, following [Rothe et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12461), we can use them partially in encoder-decoder fashion by coupling the encoder and decoder parameters, as illustrated in\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nWrite 1-2 sentences on what the training data of the model google/bigbird-roberta-large is.

It correspond to BERT/RoBERTa-like encoder only models. Following original BERT and RoBERTa implementation they are transformers with post-normalization, i.e. layer norm is happening after the attention layer. However, following [Rothe et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12461), we can use them partially in encoder-decoder fashion by coupling the encoder and decoder parameters, as illustrated in", "As these tasks are very competitive, multiple highly engineered systems have been designed specific each dataset confirming to respective output formats.

As a result we propose to first blockify the attention pattern i.e. we pack sets of query and keys together and then define attention on these blocks. It is easier to explain this process using the example shown in Fig. 3. Suppose, there are 12 query and 12 key vectors to attend to. Using a block size of 2, we split the query matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks and similarly the key matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks. Then the three different building components of BIGBIRD are defined on the block matrix. In particular\n2. In this section we provide details of the experimental setup for BIGBIRD on genomics data.\n3. We optimize the code for modern hardware. Hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs truly shine on coalesced memory operations which load blocks of contiguous bytes at once. Thus, its not very efficient to have small sporadic look-ups caused by a sliding window or random element queries. We alleviate this by \"blockifying\" the lookups.\n4. GPU/TPU and Sparsity Ideally, if the adjacency matrix A described in Sec. 2 is sparse, one would hope this would be sufficient to speed up the implementation. Unfortunately, it is well known [33,102], that such sparse multiplications cannot be efficiently implemented in GPUs. GPUs have thousands of cores performing operations in parallel. Thus, we cannot efficiently perform the sparse matrix multiplication mentioned in section Sec. 2.\n5. 1. Random attention: Each query block attends to r random key blocks. In Fig. 3a, r = 1 with block size 2. This implies that each query block of size 2 randomly attends to a key block of size 2.\n6. 2. Window local attention: While creating the block, we ensure that the number of query blocks and the number of key blocks are the same. This helps us in defining the block window attention. Every query block with index j attends to key block with index j \u2212 (w \u2212 1)/2 to j + (w \u2212 1)/2, including key block j. In Fig. 3b, w = 3 with block size 2. It means that each query block j (size 2 queries) attends to key block j \u2212 1, j, j + 1.\n7. We use four publicly available datasets Books [110], CC-News [34], Stories [89] and Wikipedia to pretrain BIGBIRD. We borrow the sentencepiece vocabulary as RoBERTa (which is in turn borrowed from GPT2). We split any document longer than 4096 into multiple documents and we join documents that were much smaller than 4096. Following the original BERT training, we mask 15% of tokens in these four datasets, and train to predict the mask. We warm start from RoBERTa's checkpoint. We train two different models:\n8. The detailed statistics of the four datasets used are given in Tab. 11. All the hyperparameters for BIGBIRD, used for creating Tab. 2 are shown in Tab. 12 and those submitted to get Tab. 3 are shown in Tab. 13. We use two types of regularization in training:\n\u2022 We used a variant of contrastive predictive coding [70] as a dual encoder model.\n\u2022 We use position embedding for ITC and relative position encoding [79] for ETC.\n9. Pretraining and MLM We follow [22,63] to create base and large versions of BIGBIRD and pretrain it using MLM objective. This task involves predicting a random subset of tokens which have been masked out. We use four standard data-sets for pretraining (listed in App. E.1, Tab. 9), warm-starting from the public RoBERTa checkpoint 2 . We compare performance in predicting the masked out tokens in terms of bits per character, following [8].

Below we summarize the results for BIGBIRD using sequence length 4096 1 , while we defer all other setup details including computational resources, batch size, step size, to App. E.\n4. Pretraining and MLM We follow [22,63] to create base and large versions of BIGBIRD and pretrain it using MLM objective. This task involves predicting a random subset of tokens which have been masked out. We use four standard data-sets for pretraining (listed in App. E.1, Tab. 9), warm-starting from the public RoBERTa checkpoint 2 . We compare performance in predicting the masked out tokens in terms of bits per character, following [8]. As seen in App. E.1, Tab. 10, both BIGBIRD and Longformer perform\n5. DNA into tokens so as to further increase the context length (App. F, Fig. 7). In particular, we build a byte-pair encoding [50] 4 . We finetuned the pretrained BIGBIRD model from above, using the training data and report F1 on test dataset. We compare our results to the previously reported best method in Tab. 6. We see that BIGBIRD achieve nearly perfect accuracy with a 5% jump from the previous best reported accuracy.   [109,46]. Thus, understanding the functional effects of non-coding regions of DNA is\n6. - pretrained BERT model for base(`bigbr_base`) and large (`bigbr_large`) size. It correspond to BERT/RoBERTa-like encoder only models. Following original BERT and RoBERTa implementation they are transformers with post-normalization, i.e. layer norm is happening after the attention layer. However, following [Rothe et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12461), we can use them partially in encoder-decoder fashion by coupling the encoder and decoder parameters, as illustrated in\n7. - pretrained Pegasus Encoder-Decoder Transformer in large size(`bigbp_large`). Again following original implementation of Pegasus, they are transformers with pre-normalization. They have full set of separate encoder-decoder weights. Also for long document summarization datasets, we have converted Pegasus checkpoints (`model.ckpt-0`) for each dataset and also provided fine-tuned checkpoints (`model.ckpt-300000`) which works on longer documents.\n8. As a result we propose to first blockify the attention pattern i.e. we pack sets of query and keys together and then define attention on these blocks. It is easier to explain this process using the example shown in Fig. 3. Suppose, there are 12 query and 12 key vectors to attend to. Using a block size of 2, we split the query matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks and similarly the key matrix into 12/2 = 6 blocks. Then the three different building components of BIGBIRD are defined on the block matrix. In particular\n9.

This task involves predicting a random subset of tokens which have been masked out. We use four standard data-sets for pretraining (listed in App. E.1, Tab. 9), warm-starting from the public RoBERTa checkpoint 2 .

Context length: As a \"BigBird\" model, it is designed to handle longer input sequences than standard BERT models. However, extremely long passages that exceed its maximum context window may still pose challenges and limit its ability to capture long-range dependencies.\n\n3. Language and dialect: The model's training data will determine which languages and dialects it performs best on. Performance may degrade when applied to languages, dialects, or writing styles that differ significantly from the training data.\n\n4. Factual knowledge: The model's outputs will be constrained by the factual knowledge present in its training data. For queries that require up-to-date or specialized knowledge beyond what the model was trained on, its responses may be outdated or incorrect.\n\n5. Task type: While large language models like bigbird-roberta-large are versatile, they may perform better on certain NLP task types (e.g., classification, extraction) than others, depending on how they were fine-tuned and optimized during training.\n\nUnderstanding these characteristics can help set appropriate expectations when applying the bigbird-roberta-large model to particular domains and contexts.

These metrics assess how well the model predicts the correct class labels for given input texts. For tasks involving sequence labeling or named entity recognition, metrics like entity-level precision, recall, and F1 score are used to evaluate the model's ability to identify and classify entities within the text. In question answering tasks, metrics such as exact match and F1 score are used to measure how well the model generates answers that match the ground truth. Additionally, perplexity and bits per character (BPC) are common metrics for evaluating language models like google/bigbird-roberta-large in terms of their ability to predict the likelihood of text sequences.", "When considering the tradeoffs between different errors in the google/bigbird-roberta-large model, it's important to understand the balance between precision and recall. Precision refers to the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.\n\nIn some cases, the model may prioritize precision, minimizing false positives at the cost of potentially missing some true positives (lower recall). This can be beneficial in scenarios where the cost of false positives is high, such as in medical diagnosis or spam email detection.\n\nOn the other hand, the model may prioritize recall, aiming to capture as many true positives as possible, even if it means accepting more false positives (lower precision). This can be advantageous in situations where the cost of missing a true positive is high, such as in fraud detection or identifying potential security threats.\n\nThe choice between optimizing for precision or recall depends on the specific application and the relative costs associated with different types of errors. In some cases, a balanced approach that considers both precision and recall, such as using the F1 score, may be most appropriate.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the model's performance may vary across different classes or categories, with some classes having higher precision or recall than others.

Pretraining and MLM We follow [22,63] to create base and large versions of BIGBIRD and pretrain it using MLM objective.

In this section our goal is to showcase benefits of modeling longer input sequence for NLP tasks, for which we select three representative tasks. We begin with basic masked language modeling (MLM; Devlin et al. 22) to check if better contextual representations can be learnt by utilizing longer contiguous sequences. Next, we consider QA with supporting evidence, for which capability to handle longer sequence would allow us to retrieve more evidence using crude systems like TF-IDF/BM25.

We demonstrate a natural task which can be solved by the full attention mechanism in O(1)-layers.

Finally, we show that sparse attention mechanisms can not universally replace dense attention mechanisms, i.e. there is no free lunch. We demonstrate a natural task which can be solved by the full attention mechanism in O(1)-layers.

(We use the standard notation\u03a9(n) to hide the dependence on poly-logarithmic factors. )\n8. The impossibility for sparse-attention follows from hardness results stemming from Orthogonal Vector Conjecture (OVC) [2,1,96,7], which is a widely used assumption in fine-grained complexity. Informally, it states that one cannot determine if the minimum inner product among n Boolean vectors is 0 in subquadratic time. with graph D having\u00d5(n) edges (i.e. inner product evaluations), would require\u03a9(n 1\u2212o(1) ) layers.\n9.

BigBird introduces several key modifications to the standard transformer architecture:\n\n1. Sparse attention: Instead of attending to all tokens in the sequence, BigBird uses a combination of global, random, and local attention. This allows the model to capture both local and global dependencies while reducing computational complexity.\n\n2. Block-wise self-attention: The input sequence is divided into blocks, and self-attention is applied within each block. This helps the model scale to longer sequences without a significant increase in computational cost.\n\n3. Random attention: In addition to local and global attention, BigBird also incorporates random attention, where each query attends to a fixed number of random keys. This helps the model capture dependencies between distant tokens.\n\nThe \"roberta-large\" part of the model name indicates that the BigBird architecture is combined with the RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) pretraining technique. RoBERTa is an improved version of BERT that uses dynamic masking, larger batch sizes, and more training data to achieve better performance on downstream tasks.\n\nIn summary, the google/bigbird-roberta-large model combines the BigBird architecture, which efficiently handles long sequences using sparse attention, with the RoBERTa pretraining approach to create a powerful language model capable of processing longer contexts while maintaining high performance on various natural language processing tasks.", "The objective of the model google/bigbird-roberta-large is to effectively process and understand long sequences of text data. This model is a variant of the RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) architecture, which is designed to improve upon the original BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model.\n\nThe \"BigBird\" component of the model refers to its ability to handle longer input sequences compared to the standard BERT and RoBERTa models.
