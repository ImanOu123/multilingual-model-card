Data augmentation: The training images were randomly cropped, resized, and flipped horizontally to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization ability.\n\n2. Optimization algorithm: The model was trained using an optimization algorithm such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or its variants, like Adam or RMSprop, to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the predicted and true class labels.\n\n3.

We do so to observe more fine-grained trends in network behavior.\n10. spaces. To obtain a distribution of models, we sample and train n models from a design space. For efficiency, we primarily do so in a low-compute, low-epoch training regime. In particular, in this section we use the 400 million flop 3 (400MF) regime and train each sampled model for 10 epochs on the ImageNet dataset [3]. We note that while we train many models, each training run is fast: training 100 models at 400MF for 10 epochs is roughly equivalent in flops to training a single ResNet-50 [8] model at 4GF\n11. We now compare top models from the RegNetX and RegNetY design spaces at various complexities to the stateof-the-art on ImageNet [3]. We denote individual models using small caps, e.g. REGNETX. We also suffix the models with the flop regime, e.g. 400MF. For each flop regime, we pick the best model from 25 random settings of the RegNet parameters (d, g, w m , w a , w 0 ), and re-train the top model 5 times at 100 epochs to obtain robust error estimates.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nSummarize the type of the model facebook/regnet-y-040 in terms of the training method, machine learning type, and modality in one sentence.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model facebook/regnet-y-040.

The preprocessed image is then passed to the model for inference.\n\nFinally, we obtain the predicted class index by finding the index with the highest logit value using `argmax()`. We then map the predicted class index to its corresponding label using the `id2label` attribute of the model's configuration.\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to easily utilize the facebook/regnet-y-040 model for image classification tasks using the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python."], "answer": ["To enable direct comparisons, and to isolate gains due to improvements solely of the network architecture, we opt to reproduce the exact EFFICIENTNET models but using our standard training setup, with a 100 epoch schedule and no regularization except weight decay (effect of longer schedule and stronger regularization are shown in Table 7).

You are ready to publish your model to Huggingface, and you need to write the model card description. In your team, you work as the project organizer who understands the overall scope and reach of the model and can roughly fill out each part of the card, and who serves as a contact person for model card updates.\n\nBelow is the reference to refer to and the question you need to answer for the model facebook/regnet-y-040 that you have worked on:\n\nReferences:\n```\n1. Our basic training settings follow [21] as discussed in \u00a73. To tune the learning rate lr and weight decay wd for REG-NET models, we perform a study, described in Figure 21. Based on this, we set lr = 0.1 and wd = 5\u202210 \u22125 for all models in \u00a74 and \u00a75. To enable faster training of our final models at 100 epochs, we increase the number of GPUs to 8, while keeping the number of images per GPU fixed. When scaling the batch size, we adjust lr using the linear scaling rule and apply 5 epoch gradual warmup [6].\n2. To enable fair comparisons, we repeat the same optimization for EFFICIENTNET in Figure 22. Interestingly, learning rate and weight decay are again stable across complexity regimes. Finally, in Table 7 we report the sizable effect of training enhancement on EFFICIENTNET-B0. The gap may be even larger for larger models (see Table 4).\n3. We provide a large set of baseline results and pretrained models available for download in the **pycls** [Model Zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md); including the simple, fast, and effective [RegNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13678) models that we hope can serve as solid baselines across a wide range of flop regimes.\n4. Please see [`GETTING_STARTED`](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for brief installation instructions and basic usage examples.\n5. Block types. In \u00a73, we showed that the RegNet design space generalizes to different block types. We describe these additional block types, shown in Figure 23, next: 1. R block: same as the X block except without groups, 2. V block: a basic block with only a single 3\u00d73 conv, 3. VR block: same as V block plus residual connections.\n6. Group width compatibility. When sampling widths w and groups widths g for our models, we may end up with incompatible values (i.e. w not divisible by g). To address this, we employ a simple strategy. Namely, we set g = w if g > w and round w to be divisible by g otherwise. The final w can be at most 1/3 different from the original w (proof omitted). For models with bottlenecks, we apply this strategy to the bottleneck width instead (and adjust widths accordingly).\n7. Group width ranges. As discussed in \u00a74, we notice the general trend that the group widths of good models are larger in higher compute regimes. To account for this, we gradually adjust the group width ranges for higher compute regimes. For example, instead of sampling g \u2264 32, at 3.2GF we use 16 \u2264 g \u2264 64 and allow any g divisible by 8.\n8. We note that good parameter values may differ across block types. E.g., in contrast to the X block, for the R block using b > 1 is better than b = 1. Our approach is robust to this.\n9. To enable direct comparisons, and to isolate gains due to improvements solely of the network architecture, we opt to reproduce the exact EFFICIENTNET models but using our standard training setup, with a 100 epoch schedule and no regularization except weight decay (effect of longer schedule and stronger regularization are shown in Table 7).

By integrating the RegNet-Y-040 model, an app can automatically analyze user-generated images and detect potentially inappropriate or harmful content, such as explicit imagery or violent scenes. This helps maintain a safer and more secure environment for users.\n\nAnother application is in visual search and recommendation systems. The model can extract meaningful features from images, allowing the app to find visually similar items or recommend products based on user preferences. This is particularly useful in e-commerce platforms or social media apps where personalized content is crucial for user engagement.\n\nAdditionally, the RegNet-Y-040 model can be employed in apps that require object detection and recognition. For instance, a mobile app designed for plant identification can leverage the model to classify different plant species based on user-captured images. Similarly, an app focused on assisting visually impaired individuals can utilize the model to describe the content of images through audio feedback.\n\nBy incorporating the Facebook RegNet-Y-040 model into a larger ecosystem or app, developers can harness its robust image classification capabilities to create intelligent, efficient, and user-friendly applications across various domains, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.", "I apologize for the confusion, but you haven't provided a specific question about the Facebook RegNet-Y-040 model.

Furthermore, an important property of the design space design is that it is more interpretable and can lead to insights that we can learn from. We analyze the RegNet design space and arrive at interesting findings that do not match the current practice of network", "As a testbed for this paradigm, our focus is on exploring network structure (e.g., width, depth, groups, etc.) assuming standard model families including VGG [26], ResNet [8], and ResNeXt [31]. We start with a relatively unconstrained design space we call AnyNet (e.g., widths and depths vary freely across stages) and apply our humanin-the-loop methodology to arrive at a low-dimensional design space consisting of simple \"regular\" networks, that we call RegNet. The core of the RegNet design space is simple:", "arrive at a low-dimensional design space consisting of simple, regular networks that we call RegNet. The core insight of the RegNet parametrization is surprisingly simple: widths and depths of good networks can be explained by a quantized linear function. We analyze the RegNet design space and arrive at interesting findings that do not match the current practice of network design. The RegNet design space provides simple and fast networks that work well across a wide range of flop regimes. Under comparable", "Comparisons are shown in Figure 17 and Table 3. Overall, we see that REGNETX models, by optimizing the network structure alone, provide considerable improvements under all complexity metrics. We emphasize that good REG-NET models are available across a wide range of compute regimes, including in low-compute regimes where good RESNE(X)T models are not available.", "We also observe that for EFFICIENTNET, activations scale linearly with flops (due to the scaling of both resolution and depth), compared to activations scaling with the square-root of flops for REGNETs. This leads to slow GPU training and inference times for EFFICIENTNET. E.g., REGNETX-8000 is 5\u00d7 faster than EFFICIENTNET-B5, while having lower error.", "To enable direct comparisons, and to isolate gains due to improvements solely of the network architecture, we opt to reproduce the exact EFFICIENTNET models but using our standard training setup, with a 100 epoch schedule and no regularization except weight decay (effect of longer schedule and stronger regularization are shown in Table 7). We optimize only lr and wd, see Figure 22 in appendix. This is the same setup as REGNET and enables fair comparisons.", "We emphasize that REGNET models use our basic 100 epoch schedule with no regularization except weight decay, while most mobile networks use longer schedules with various enhancements, such as deep supervision [16], Cutout [4], DropPath [14], AutoAugment [2], and so on. As such, we hope our strong results obtained with a short training schedule without enhancements can serve as a simple baseline for future work. Table 2. Mobile regime.

First, REGNET models are surprisingly effective in the mobile regime. We hope that these simple models can serve as strong baselines for future work. Next, REGNET models lead to considerable improvements over standard RESNE(X)T [8,31] models in all metrics.

Fewer stages. In \u00a75 we observed that the top REGNET models at high flops have few blocks in the fourth stage (one or two). Hence we tested 3 stage networks at 6.4GF, trained for 100 epochs each. In Figure 19 (middle), we show the results and observe that the three stage networks perform considerably worse. We note, however, that additional changes (e.g., in the stem or head) may be necessary for three stage networks to perform well (left for future work).\n2. Fixed depth. In \u00a75 we observed that the depths of our top models are fairly stable (\u223c20 blocks). In Figure 19 (left) we compare using fixed depth (d = 20) across flop regimes. To compare to our best results, we trained each model for 100 epochs. Surprisingly, we find that fixed-depth networks can match the performance of variable depth networks for all flop regimes, in both the average and best case. Indeed, these fixed depth networks match our best results in \u00a75.\n3. Inverted Bottleneck. In \u00a74 we observed that using the inverted bottleneck (b < 1) degrades performance. Since our results were in a low-compute regime, in Figure 19 (right) we re-test at 6.4GF and 100 epochs. Surprisingly, we find that in this regime b < 1 degrades results further. Swish vs. ReLU Many recent methods employ the Swish [22] activation function, e.g. [29]. In Figure 20, we study RegNetY with Swish and ReLU. We find that Swish outperforms ReLU at low flops, but ReLU is better at high flops.\n4. Interestingly, if g is restricted to be 1 (depthwise conv), Swish performs much better than ReLU. This suggests that depthwise conv and Swish interact favorably, although the underlying reason is not at all clear.\n5. In this work, we present a new network design paradigm. Our results suggest that designing network design spaces is a promising avenue for future research.\n6. We now compare top models from the RegNetX and RegNetY design spaces at various complexities to the stateof-the-art on ImageNet [3]. We denote individual models using small caps, e.g. REGNETX. We also suffix the models with the flop regime, e.g. 400MF. For each flop regime, we pick the best model from 25 random settings of the RegNet parameters (d, g, w m , w a , w 0 ), and re-train the top model 5 times at 100 epochs to obtain robust error estimates.\n7. for RegNetX a fixed resolution of 224\u00d7224 is best, even at higher flops. SE. Finally, we evaluate RegNetX with the popular Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) op [10] (we abbreviate X+SE as Y and refer to the resulting design space as RegNetY). In Figure 14 (right), we see that RegNetY yields good gains.  Figure 15. Top REGNETX models. We measure inference time for 64 images on an NVIDIA V100 GPU; train time is for 100 epochs on 8 GPUs with the batch size listed. Network diagram legends contain all information\n8. RegNetX constrained. Using these findings, we refine the RegNetX design space. First, based on Figure 11 (top), we set b = 1, d \u2264 40, and w m \u2265 2. Second, we limit parameters and activations, following Figure 12 (bottom). This yields fast, low-parameter, low-memory models without affecting accuracy. In Figure 13, we test RegNetX with theses constraints and observe that the constrained version is superior across all flop regimes. We use this version in \u00a75, and further limit depth to 12 \u2264 d \u2264 28 (see also\n9. F (e) gives the fraction of models with error less than e. We show the error EDF for n = 500 sampled models from the AnyNetX design space (described in \u00a73.2) in Figure 2 (left). Given a population of trained models, we can plot and analyze various network properties versus network error, see Figure 2 (middle) and (right) for two examples taken from the AnyNetX design space. Such visualizations show 1D projections of a complex, high-dimensional space, and can help obtain insights into the design space. For\n10. Our goal is to design better networks for visual recognition. Rather than designing or searching for a single best model under specific settings, we study the behavior of populations of models. We aim to discover general design principles that can apply to and improve an entire model population. Such design principles can provide insights into network design and are more likely to generalize to new settings (unlike a single model tuned for a specific scenario).\n11.

Responsible deployment with human oversight is important.\n\nTechnical limitations: \n- The references focus on optimizing accuracy, parameters, memory usage and inference speed on ImageNet. However, performance may degrade on data distributions that differ from ImageNet.\n- [More Information Needed] on robustness to adversarial attacks, common corruptions, and domain shift.\n- Scaling behavior and optimal architecture at even higher compute budgets (beyond 16GF) is not explored.\n\nSociotechnical limitations:\n- [More Information Needed] on the environmental and financial costs of training the model at larger scales.\n- Deploying large models like RegNetY-040 in real-world applications requires significant compute resources, which could limit accessibility.\n- Overreliance on large pretrained models like RegNetY-040 may centralize power in the AI ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, key limitations seem to be potential demographic biases from ImageNet, lack of robustness analysis, and centralization risks.

In Figure 20, we study RegNetY with Swish and ReLU. We find that Swish outperforms ReLU at low flops, but ReLU is better at high flops.\n3. Fixed depth. In \u00a75 we observed that the depths of our top models are fairly stable (\u223c20 blocks). In Figure 19 (left) we compare using fixed depth (d = 20) across flop regimes. To compare to our best results, we trained each model for 100 epochs. Surprisingly, we find that fixed-depth networks can match the performance of variable depth networks for all flop regimes, in both the average and best case. Indeed, these fixed depth networks match our best results in \u00a75.\n4. Interestingly, if g is restricted to be 1 (depthwise conv), Swish performs much better than ReLU. This suggests that depthwise conv and Swish interact favorably, although the underlying reason is not at all clear.\n5. In this work, we present a new network design paradigm. Our results suggest that designing network design spaces is a promising avenue for future research.\n6. We actively welcome your pull requests!

Overall, we see that REGNETX models, by optimizing the network structure alone, provide considerable improvements under all complexity metrics. We emphasize that good REG-NET models are available across a wide range of compute regimes, including in low-compute regimes where good RESNE(X)T models are not available.\n9. We now compare top models from the RegNetX and RegNetY design spaces at various complexities to the stateof-the-art on ImageNet [3]. We denote individual models using small caps, e.g. REGNETX. We also suffix the models with the flop regime, e.g. 400MF. For each flop regime, we pick the best model from 25 random settings of the RegNet parameters (d, g, w m , w a , w 0 ), and re-train the top model 5 times at 100 epochs to obtain robust error estimates.\n10. To enable direct comparisons, and to isolate gains due to improvements solely of the network architecture, we opt to reproduce the exact EFFICIENTNET models but using our standard training setup, with a 100 epoch schedule and no regularization except weight decay (effect of longer schedule and stronger regularization are shown in Table 7). We optimize only lr and wd, see Figure 22 in appendix. This is the same setup as REGNET and enables fair comparisons.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nWhat are recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model facebook/regnet-y-040?\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model facebook/regnet-y-040. If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the RegNet model development, here are some recommendations regarding foreseeable issues with the facebook/regnet-y-040 model:\n\nDepth and Number of Stages:\nThe references suggest that RegNet models perform best with around 20 blocks and 4 stages. Using significantly fewer stages (e.g. 3) degraded performance. Therefore, the regnet-y-040 model should likely maintain a depth of around 20 blocks split across 4 stages for optimal results. Deviating too much from this structure could lead to performance issues.\n\nInverted Bottleneck: \nThe references found that using an inverted bottleneck (bottleneck ratio b < 1) degraded RegNet performance, even at higher compute regimes. The regnet-y-040 model should avoid using inverted bottlenecks.\n\nActivation Function:\nThe choice of activation function depends on the compute regime. Swish outperformed ReLU at low flops, but ReLU was better at high flops. [More Information Needed] on the specific flop regime of regnet-y-040 to determine the optimal activation function.\n\nSocietal Impact:\n[More Information Needed] The references do not provide sufficient information to assess potential societal impacts and issues stemming from the regnet-y-040 model. More details are needed on the intended use cases, deployment domains, user demographics, fairness evaluations, etc. to properly analyze ethical risks and social implications. The development team should carefully consider and test for unintended biases and harms prior to publishing the model.\n\nIn summary, the regnet-y-040 model should adhere to the general RegNet architecture guidelines for depth, bottleneck ratio, and activation functions as outlined in the references to ensure strong performance. However, more information is needed to responsibly assess the societal impacts and potential issues of deploying this model. I recommend the team conduct thorough testing and analysis of social risks prior to publishing."}

RegNet-Y-040 is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for image classification tasks, and the details of its data preprocessing pipeline are not readily available in the standard model documentation.\n\nIn general, image classification models like RegNet-Y-040 often follow these common preprocessing steps:\n\n1. Resizing: Input images are typically resized to a fixed resolution that matches the input size expected by the model.\n\n2.

As a preprocessing step, input images need to be resized and normalized before being fed into the model.\n\nResizing: The model expects input images to have a fixed size of 224x224 pixels. If the original image has different dimensions, it needs to be resized to match the expected input size. This is typically done using techniques like bilinear interpolation or nearest-neighbor interpolation, which adjust the image's dimensions while preserving its aspect ratio.\n\nNormalization: After resizing, the pixel values of the input image are normalized. The facebook/regnet-y-040 model expects pixel values to be in the range of [-1, 1]. To achieve this, the pixel values are scaled from their original range (e.g., [0, 255] for RGB images) to the range of [0, 1] by dividing each pixel value by 255. Then, the scaled pixel values are further normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the ImageNet dataset, which the model was trained on. The specific normalization values used are: mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and standard deviation = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225] for the RGB channels, respectively.\n\nBy applying these preprocessing steps of resizing and normalization, the input images are transformed into a consistent format that the facebook/regnet-y-040 model expects, enabling accurate image classification."]}

This leads to slow GPU training and inference times for EFFICIENTNET. E.g., REGNETX-8000 is 5\u00d7 faster than EFFICIENTNET-B5, while having lower error.\n5. In the main paper we perform all experiments on the Im-ageNet [3] validation set. Here we evaluate our models on the ImageNetV2 [24] test set (original test set unavailable).\n6. We emphasize that REGNET models use our basic 100 epoch schedule with no regularization except weight decay, while most mobile networks use longer schedules with various enhancements, such as deep supervision [16], Cutout [4], DropPath [14], AutoAugment [2], and so on. As such, we hope our strong results obtained with a short training schedule without enhancements can serve as a simple baseline for future work. Table 2. Mobile regime. We compare existing models using originally reported errors to RegNet\n7. We now compare top models from the RegNetX and RegNetY design spaces at various complexities to the stateof-the-art on ImageNet [3]. We denote individual models using small caps, e.g. REGNETX. We also suffix the models with the flop regime, e.g. 400MF. For each flop regime, we pick the best model from 25 random settings of the RegNet parameters (d, g, w m , w a , w 0 ), and re-train the top model 5 times at 100 epochs to obtain robust error estimates.\n8. Comparisons are shown in Figure 17 and Table 3. Overall, we see that REGNETX models, by optimizing the network structure alone, provide considerable improvements under all complexity metrics. We emphasize that good REG-NET models are available across a wide range of compute regimes, including in low-compute regimes where good RESNE(X)T models are not available.\n9. for RegNetX a fixed resolution of 224\u00d7224 is best, even at higher flops. SE. Finally, we evaluate RegNetX with the popular Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) op [10] (we abbreviate X+SE as Y and refer to the resulting design space as RegNetY). In Figure 14 (right), we see that RegNetY yields good gains.  Figure 15. Top REGNETX models.

The outcome of the search is a single network instance tuned to a specific setting (e.g., hardware platform). This is sufficient in some cases; however, it does not enable discovery of network design principles that deepen our understanding and allow us to generalize to new settings. In\n2. Deep convolutional neural networks are the engine of visual recognition. Over the past several years better architectures have resulted in considerable progress in a wide range of visual recognition tasks. Examples include LeNet [15], AlexNet [13], VGG [26], and ResNet [8]. This body of work advanced both the effectiveness of neural networks as well as our understanding of network design. In particular, the above sequence of works demonstrated the importance of convolution, network and data size, depth, and\n3. Next, we compare to the state-of-the-art EFFICIENT-NET [29] models across compute regimes. Under comparable training settings and flops, REGNET models outperform EFFICIENTNET models while being up to 5\u00d7 faster on GPUs. We further test generalization on ImageNetV2 [24].\n4. We design the RegNet design space in a low-compute, low-epoch regime using a single network block type on Im-ageNet [3]. We then show that the RegNet design space generalizes to larger compute regimes, schedule lengths, and network block types. Furthermore, an important property of the design space design is that it is more interpretable and can lead to insights that we can learn from. We analyze the RegNet design space and arrive at interesting findings that do not match the current practice of network\n5. As a testbed for this paradigm, our focus is on exploring network structure (e.g., width, depth, groups, etc.) assuming standard model families including VGG [26], ResNet [8], and ResNeXt [31]. We start with a relatively unconstrained design space we call AnyNet (e.g., widths and depths vary freely across stages) and apply our humanin-the-loop methodology to arrive at a low-dimensional design space consisting of simple \"regular\" networks, that we call RegNet. The core of the RegNet design space is simple:\n6. Evaluation setup. To study generalization of models developed on ImageNet, the authors of [24] collect a new test set following the original procedure (ImageNetV2). They find that the overall model ranks are preserved on the new test set. The absolute errors, however, increase. We repeat the comparisons from \u00a75 on the ImageNetV2 test set. RESNE(X)T comparisons. We compare to RESNE(X)T models in Table 5. We observe that while model ranks are generally consistent, the gap between them decreases.\n7. Fewer stages. In \u00a75 we observed that the top REGNET models at high flops have few blocks in the fourth stage (one or two). Hence we tested 3 stage networks at 6.4GF, trained for 100 epochs each. In Figure 19 (middle), we show the results and observe that the three stage networks perform considerably worse. We note, however, that additional changes (e.g., in the stem or head) may be necessary for three stage networks to perform well (left for future work).\n8. Inverted Bottleneck. In \u00a74 we observed that using the inverted bottleneck (b < 1) degrades performance. Since our results were in a low-compute regime, in Figure 19 (right) we re-test at 6.4GF and 100 epochs. Surprisingly, we find that in this regime b < 1 degrades results further. Swish vs. ReLU Many recent methods employ the Swish [22] activation function, e.g. [29]. In Figure 20, we study RegNetY with Swish and ReLU. We find that Swish outperforms ReLU at low flops, but ReLU is better at high flops.\n9. We now compare top models from the RegNetX and RegNetY design spaces at various complexities to the stateof-the-art on ImageNet [3]. We denote individual models using small caps, e.g. REGNETX. We also suffix the models with the flop regime, e.g. 400MF. For each flop regime, we pick the best model from 25 random settings of the RegNet parameters (d, g, w m , w a , w 0 ), and re-train the top model 5 times at 100 epochs to obtain robust error estimates.\n10.

They find that the overall model ranks are preserved on the new test set. The absolute errors, however, increase. We repeat the comparisons from \u00a75 on the ImageNetV2 test set. RESNE(X)T comparisons. We compare to RESNE(X)T models in Table 5. We observe that while model ranks are generally consistent, the gap between them decreases.\n11. Our goal is to design better networks for visual recognition. Rather than designing or searching for a single best model under specific settings, we study the behavior of populations of models. We aim to discover general design principles that can apply to and improve an entire model population. Such design principles can provide insights into network design and are more likely to generalize to new settings (unlike a single model tuned for a specific scenario).\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nWhat are the foreseeable characteristics that will influence how the model facebook/regnet-y-040 behaves? This includes domain and context, as well as population subgroups. Evaluation should ideally be disaggregated across factors in order to uncover disparities in performance.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model facebook/regnet-y-040.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the RegNet model family, here are some key characteristics that may influence how the facebook/regnet-y-040 model behaves:\n\nDomain and Context:\n- The RegNet models were developed and evaluated primarily on the ImageNet dataset for visual recognition tasks. Performance on other domains like medical imaging, satellite imagery, etc. is not discussed and may vary. [More Information Needed]\n\n- RegNets aim to discover general network design principles rather than a single best architecture. This focus on model populations instead of individual models tuned for specific scenarios suggests the design may generalize better to new settings.\n\nPopulation Subgroups:\n- [More Information Needed] The references do not provide any information on disaggregated evaluation across different population subgroups in the ImageNet data (e.g. by race, gender, age, etc.) to uncover potential performance disparities. This is an important consideration that requires further analysis.\n\n- The RegNet-Y-040 model is compared against EfficientNets in a similar compute regime. While RegNets outperform EfficientNets overall, relative subgroup performance between the two model families is not discussed.\n\nOther Factors:\n- Activation functions impact RegNet performance. Swish outperforms ReLU at low FLOPs but ReLU is better at high FLOPs. The choice of activation in RegNet-Y-040 will affect its behavior.\n\n- The number of network stages influences RegNet accuracy, with 3-stage variants performing considerably worse than the default 4 stages in the high FLOP regime tested. The stage configuration of RegNet-Y-040 is an important characteristic.\n\nIn summary, while the RegNet-Y-040 model is likely to perform well on natural image recognition tasks similar to ImageNet, more information is needed to characterize its behavior on other domains and across different population subgroups. The model's overall design principles, activation function, and network stage configuration are additional factors that will impact its performance characteristics."}

Evaluation setup. To study generalization of models developed on ImageNet, the authors of [24] collect a new test set following the original procedure (ImageNetV2). They find that the overall model ranks are preserved on the new test set. The absolute errors, however, increase. We repeat the comparisons from \u00a75 on the ImageNetV2 test set. RESNE(X)T comparisons. We compare to RESNE(X)T models in Table 5. We observe that while model ranks are generally consistent, the gap between them decreases.\n3. Our goal is to perform fair comparisons and provide simple and easy-to-reproduce baselines. We note that along with better architectures, much of the recently reported gains in network performance are based on enhancements to the training setup and regularization scheme (see Table 7). As our focus is on evaluating network architectures, we perform carefully controlled experiments under the same training setup. In particular, to provide fair comparisons to classic work, we do not use any training-time\n4. EFFICIENTNET comparisons. We compare to EFFICIENT-NET models in Table 6. As before, we observe that the model ranks are generally consistent but the gap decreases. Overall, the results confirm that the REGNET models perform comparably to state-of-the-art EFFICIENTNET while being up to 5\u00d7 faster on GPUs.\n5. Resulting top REGNETX and REGNETY models for each flop regime are shown in Figures 15 and 16, respectively. In addition to the simple linear structure and the trends we analyzed in \u00a74, we observe an interesting pattern. Namely, the higher flop models have a large number of blocks in the third stage and a small number of blocks in the last stage. This is similar to the design of standard RESNET models. Moreover, we observe that the group width g increases with complexity, but depth d saturates for large\n6. for RegNetX a fixed resolution of 224\u00d7224 is best, even at higher flops. SE. Finally, we evaluate RegNetX with the popular Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) op [10] (we abbreviate X+SE as Y and refer to the resulting design space as RegNetY). In Figure 14 (right), we see that RegNetY yields good gains.  Figure 15. Top REGNETX models. We measure inference time for 64 images on an NVIDIA V100 GPU; train time is for 100 epochs on 8 GPUs with the batch size listed. Network diagram legends contain all information\n7. As the RegNetX design space has a high concentration of good models, for the following results we switch to sampling fewer models (100) but training them for longer (25 epochs) with a learning rate of 0.1 (see appendix). We do so to observe more fine-grained trends in network behavior.\n8. RegNet trends. We show trends in the RegNetX parameters across flop regimes in Figure 11. Remarkably, the depth of best models is stable across regimes (top-left), with an optimal depth of \u223c20 blocks (60 layers). This is in contrast to the common practice of using deeper models for higher flop regimes. We also observe that the best models use a bottleneck ratio b of 1.0 (top-middle), which effectively removes the bottleneck (commonly used in practice). Next, we observe that the width multiplier w m of good\n9. Comparisons are shown in Figure 17 and Table 3. Overall, we see that REGNETX models, by optimizing the network structure alone, provide considerable improvements under all complexity metrics. We emphasize that good REG-NET models are available across a wide range of compute regimes, including in low-compute regimes where good RESNE(X)T models are not available.\n10. RegNet trends.

We show the error EDF for n = 500 sampled models from the AnyNetX design space (described in \u00a73.2) in Figure 2 (left). Given a population of trained models, we can plot and analyze various network properties versus network error, see Figure 2 (middle) and (right) for two examples taken from the AnyNetX design space. Such visualizations show 1D projections of a complex, high-dimensional space, and can help obtain insights into the design space.

Overall, we see that REGNETX models, by optimizing the network structure alone, provide considerable improvements under all complexity metrics. We emphasize that good REG-NET models are available across a wide range of compute regimes, including in low-compute regimes where good RESNE(X)T models are not available.\n7. Our goal is to design better networks for visual recognition. Rather than designing or searching for a single best model under specific settings, we study the behavior of populations of models. We aim to discover general design principles that can apply to and improve an entire model population. Such design principles can provide insights into network design and are more likely to generalize to new settings (unlike a single model tuned for a specific scenario).\n8. We also observe that for EFFICIENTNET, activations scale linearly with flops (due to the scaling of both resolution and depth), compared to activations scaling with the square-root of flops for REGNETs. This leads to slow GPU training and inference times for EFFICIENTNET. E.g., REGNETX-8000 is 5\u00d7 faster than EFFICIENTNET-B5, while having lower error.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nThis is an experimental section some developers are beginning to add, where work on explainability/interpretability may go about the model facebook/regnet-y-040.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model facebook/regnet-y-040.

Our basic training settings follow [21] as discussed in \u00a73. To tune the learning rate lr and weight decay wd for REG-NET models, we perform a study, described in Figure 21. Based on this, we set lr = 0.1 and wd = 5\u202210 \u22125 for all models in \u00a74 and \u00a75. To enable faster training of our final models at 100 epochs, we increase the number of GPUs to 8, while keeping the number of images per GPU fixed. When scaling the batch size, we adjust lr using the linear scaling rule and apply 5 epoch gradual warmup [6].\n3. To enable direct comparisons, and to isolate gains due to improvements solely of the network architecture, we opt to reproduce the exact EFFICIENTNET models but using our standard training setup, with a 100 epoch schedule and no regularization except weight decay (effect of longer schedule and stronger regularization are shown in Table 7). We optimize only lr and wd, see Figure 22 in appendix. This is the same setup as REGNET and enables fair comparisons.\n4. We emphasize that REGNET models use our basic 100 epoch schedule with no regularization except weight decay, while most mobile networks use longer schedules with various enhancements, such as deep supervision [16], Cutout [4], DropPath [14], AutoAugment [2], and so on. As such, we hope our strong results obtained with a short training schedule without enhancements can serve as a simple baseline for future work. Table 2. Mobile regime. We compare existing models using originally reported errors to RegNet\n5. To enable fair comparisons, we repeat the same optimization for EFFICIENTNET in Figure 22. Interestingly, learning rate and weight decay are again stable across complexity regimes. Finally, in Table 7 we report the sizable effect of training enhancement on EFFICIENTNET-B0. The gap may be even larger for larger models (see Table 4).\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the amount of carbon emitted when training the model facebook/regnet-y-040.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model facebook/regnet-y-040.
