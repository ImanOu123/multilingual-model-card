Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on 25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10\n3. Although predicting which words were spoken in a given audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normal-ization. These components are often handled separately, resulting in a relatively complex system around the core speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity,\n4. segments was used, and the models are trained for 2 20 updates which is between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern, and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness. Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters. 3 During early development and evaluation we observed that Whisper models had a\n5. include the segment. Lastly, we add a <|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the training loss over the previous context text, and train the model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of\n6. As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize much more effectively to held-out datasets than models trained on a single source. These works achieve this by combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a moderate amount of this data easily available.\n7. Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech recognition. We achieve these results without the need for the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust speech recognition, we release inference code and models at the following URL: https://github.com/openai/ whisper.\n8. pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system should be to work reliably \"out of the box\" in a broad range of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of a decoder for every deployment distribution.\n9. Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.\n10. Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale text from the internet for training machine learning systems, we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies the speech recognition pipeline since it\n11.

Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages As Figure 3 shows, Whisper's speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount of training data for the language. Since our pre-training dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have\n4. transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio.

The openai/whisper-base model expects the audio to be in a specific format, such as 16kHz mono-channel WAV files. You may need to resample and convert your audio input accordingly.\n\n3. Extract audio features: The model relies on specific audio features as input. Typically, log-mel spectrograms are used as features for speech recognition models. You'll need to compute these features from your preprocessed audio input using signal processing techniques like the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) and mel-scale filterbanks.\n\n4. Perform inference: Pass the extracted audio features through the loaded openai/whisper-base model to obtain the predicted transcriptions. The model will process the input features and generate output probabilities for each possible character or subword unit.\n\n5. Postprocess the output: The model's output will be in the form of probabilities or log probabilities for each time step. You'll need to decode these probabilities into human-readable text using techniques like greedy decoding or beam search decoding. This step converts the model's output into the final transcribed text.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use the openai/whisper-base model without relying on a pre-built pipeline. This approach gives you more control over the individual components of the speech recognition process and allows for customization based on your specific requirements.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that using the model directly requires a good understanding of the model's architecture, input/output formats, and the necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps. Pipelines, on the other hand, abstract away these details and provide a more convenient and user-friendly interface for performing speech recognition tasks.", "The openai/whisper-base model is a speech recognition model developed by OpenAI. It is part of the Whisper family of models, which are designed to transcribe audio into text. The \"base\" version of the model is the smallest and fastest variant, making it suitable for real-time transcription tasks.\n\nTo use the openai/whisper-base model, you can leverage the `transformers` library in Python. Here's a code snippet demonstrating how to transcribe an audio file using the model:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import WhisperProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\n# Load the openai/whisper-base model and processor\nmodel = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-base\")\nprocessor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-base\")\n\n# Load an audio file from the Librispeech dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(\"hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_dummy\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\naudio_file = dataset[0][\"audio\"][\"path\"]\n\n# Preprocess the audio file\naudio = processor.feature_extractor(audio_file, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_features\n\n# Generate the transcription\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(audio)\ntranscription = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\n\nprint(transcription)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n1. We load the openai/whisper-base model and its associated processor using the `from_pretrained()` method from the `transformers` library.\n2. We load an audio file from the Librispeech dataset using the `load_dataset()` function.\n3. We preprocess the audio file using the `feature_extractor` from the processor, which converts the audio into input features suitable for the model.\n4. We generate the transcription by passing the preprocessed audio to the model's `generate()` method.\n5. Finally, we decode the generated transcription using the `batch_decode()` method from the processor and print the result.\n\nThe openai/whisper-base model provides a simple and efficient way to transcribe audio into text using a pre-trained deep learning model. It can be used for various applications, such as speech recognition, automatic subtitling, and more."]}

When fine-tuned for a specific task, such as transcribing lectures or meetings, the model can be adapted to better understand and transcribe the unique vocabulary, accents, and speaking styles associated with that particular domain.\n\nFine-tuning involves training the pre-trained whisper-base model on a smaller dataset relevant to the target task. This process allows the model to learn the specific nuances and patterns of the audio data in that domain, thereby improving its accuracy and performance. For example, if the model is fine-tuned using a dataset of medical lectures, it will learn to recognize and transcribe medical terminology more accurately.\n\nTo fine-tune the whisper-base model, you would typically:\n\n1. Prepare a labeled dataset containing audio files and their corresponding transcriptions specific to your task.\n2. Use a portion of this dataset to fine-tune the whisper-base model using techniques like transfer learning.\n3. Evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance on a separate test set to ensure it has learned the task-specific patterns effectively.\n\nOnce fine-tuned, the whisper-base model can be deployed to transcribe new audio data related to the target task with higher accuracy compared to the base model. This fine-tuning process enables the model to be adapted for various domain-specific ASR applications, such as transcribing customer support calls, generating subtitles for educational videos, or even assisting with speech-to-text tasks in low-resource languages.", "The openai/whisper-base model is a powerful tool for automatic speech recognition (ASR) that can be seamlessly integrated into a larger ecosystem or application. When plugged into a broader system, this model enables the conversion of spoken language into written text, opening up a wide range of possibilities for enhancing user experiences and automating processes.\n\nOne of the primary use cases for the openai/whisper-base model is in the development of voice-controlled applications. By incorporating this model, developers can create apps that allow users to interact with the system using natural language commands. For example, a smart home app could use the model to interpret voice instructions for controlling various devices, such as lights, thermostats, or appliances.\n\nMoreover, the openai/whisper-base model can be utilized in customer service applications, such as chatbots or virtual assistants. By transcribing user inquiries or requests spoken over the phone or through voice messages, the model can help automate the process of understanding and responding to customer needs. This integration can lead to faster response times, improved efficiency, and enhanced customer satisfaction.\n\nIn the realm of content creation and analysis, the openai/whisper-base model can be employed to transcribe audio and video files automatically. This functionality is particularly useful for generating subtitles, captions, or transcripts for multimedia content, making it more accessible to a wider audience. Additionally, the transcribed text can be further processed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights, perform sentiment analysis, or enable content search and retrieval.\n\nOverall, the openai/whisper-base model's ability to convert speech to text makes it a valuable asset when integrated into a larger ecosystem or application. Its versatility allows developers to create innovative solutions that leverage the power of voice interaction, automate processes, and derive meaningful insights from spoken language data.", "Here's a short passage answering the question about the model openai/whisper-base, along with a code snippet:\n\nThe openai/whisper-base model is a pre-trained model developed by OpenAI for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. It is part of the Whisper model family, which consists of models trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is capable of transcribing speech in multiple languages.\n\nTo use the openai/whisper-base model for speech recognition, you can utilize the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python. Here's a code snippet demonstrating how to transcribe an audio file using the openai/whisper-base model:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import WhisperProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\n# Load the openai/whisper-base model and processor\nmodel = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-base\")\nprocessor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/whisper-base\")\n\n# Load an audio file\ndataset = load_dataset(\"hf-internal-testing/librispeech_asr_demo\", \"clean\", split=\"validation\")\naudio_file = dataset[0][\"audio\"][\"path\"]\n\n# Preprocess the audio file\naudio = processor.feature_extractor(audio_file, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_features\n\n# Perform speech recognition\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(audio)\ntranscription = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\n\nprint(transcription)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, we first load the openai/whisper-base model and its associated processor using the `WhisperForConditionalGeneration` and `WhisperProcessor` classes from the Transformers library.\n\nNext, we load an audio file using the `load_dataset` function from the Datasets library. You can replace this with your own audio file path.\n\nWe then preprocess the audio file using the `feature_extractor` from the processor, which converts the audio into input features suitable for the model.\n\nFinally, we generate the transcription by passing the preprocessed audio features to the model's `generate` method. The generated text is then decoded using the `batch_decode` function from the processor, and the resulting transcription is printed.\n\nThe openai/whisper-base model provides a powerful and efficient way to perform automatic speech recognition on audio files, supporting multiple languages and delivering accurate transcriptions."], "answer": ["transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio.

A fully featured speech recognition system can involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normal-ization. These components are often handled separately, resulting in a relatively complex system around the core speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity,\n3. we would like to have a single model perform the entire speech processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An important consideration here is the interface for the model. There are many different tasks that can be performed on the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice activity detection, alignment, and language identification are some examples.\n4. For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript\n5. include the segment. Lastly, we add a <|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the training loss over the previous context text, and train the model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 1. Overview of our approach.

Although the decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly, we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to more directly optimize for decoding performance could help further reduce these errors.\n3. Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages As Figure 3 shows, Whisper's speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount of training data for the language. Since our pre-training dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have\n4. Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual. They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not\n5. Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on the robustness properties of speech processing systems and as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance of Whisper.

An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows for direct comparisons with\n6. Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research.

[Reference 7]\n\n- Whisper should not be used in high-stakes domains requiring near-perfect accuracy, as it still makes some stubborn errors in long-form transcription like getting stuck in loops or hallucinating unrelated text. Further work is needed to reduce these failure modes. [References 2, 4] \n\n- Users should be cautious about applying Whisper to low-resource languages, as the model's performance is still quite poor for many languages that had less training data. Increasing language-specific training data is an important direction for improving the model.

Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages As Figure 3 shows, Whisper's speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount of training data for the language. Since our pre-training dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have\n2. As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper's robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an audio conditional language model. It's currently unclear to what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either ablating various design components of Whisper, such as training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the performance of existing speech recognition encoders such as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together\n3. Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual. They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not\n4. transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly, we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to more directly optimize for decoding performance could help further reduce these errors.\n5. Whisper departs noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that the results could be further improved by incorporating this.\n6. Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on the robustness properties of speech processing systems and as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it being representative of general reliability, for many domains where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning. An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows for direct comparisons with\n7. tendency to transcribe plausible but almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.

With the exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the Whisper speech recognition model, here are some recommendations regarding foreseeable issues with the openai/whisper-base model:\n\n1. Performance on low-resource languages could be improved by increasing the amount of training data for those languages, as the current dataset is English-heavy. More diverse data collection is needed.\n\n2. [More Information Needed] on the specific contributions of the encoder vs. decoder to Whisper's robustness. Ablation studies or experiments with other encoders could provide insights.\n\n3. Decoding errors like looping, skipping words, or hallucination are still issues, especially on long-form transcription. Fine-tuning on high-quality datasets or using reinforcement learning techniques may help reduce these.\n\n4. [More Information Needed] on whether incorporating unsupervised pre-training or self-teaching methods used in other state-of-the-art models could further improve Whisper's performance.\n\n5. Fine-tuning Whisper on specific domains where supervised data is available is likely to boost results and enable direct comparisons to other models. More studies are needed on fine-tuning.\n\n6. The model has a tendency to make incorrect guesses about speaker names, as this information is rarely inferable from the audio alone. [More Information Needed] on mitigation strategies.\n\n7. While performance continues to scale with model size in most tasks, diminishing returns are seen for English ASR, possibly due to saturation as human-level performance is approached. Analyzing scaling trends can inform efficient model sizing.\n\n8. Whisper aims to be a fully-featured recognition system, but some components like voice activity detection, speaker diarization and inverse text normalization may still need to be handled separately. [More Information Needed] on Whisper's capabilities in these areas and opportunities for a more integrated system.\n\nIn summary, key issues include low-resource language performance, decoding errors, analyzing the impact of different architectural components and training techniques, studying fine-tuning behavior, mitigating incorrect speaker labeling, model scaling efficiency, and expanding Whisper's capabilities as an integrated speech recognition system. Collecting more diverse data, conducting ablation studies, and exploring techniques used in other state-of-the-art models could help address these issues."}

As such, several domain and context characteristics can influence its behavior:\n\n1. Accent and pronunciation: The model's performance may vary depending on the speaker's accent, dialect, or pronunciation. If the model was primarily trained on a specific set of accents, it might struggle with less represented accents or regional variations.\n\n2. Background noise: The presence of background noise, such as ambient sounds, music, or other speakers, can impact the model's ability to accurately transcribe speech. The model's performance may degrade in noisy environments.\n\n3. Domain-specific vocabulary: If the speech contains domain-specific terminology, jargon, or technical terms that are not well-represented in the training data, the model may struggle to accurately transcribe these words.\n\n4. Language and multilingualism: The model's performance may be influenced by the language being spoken. If the model was trained primarily on English, it may not perform as well on other languages or in multilingual contexts.\n\n5. Speaking style and speed: The model's performance can be affected by the speaker's style, such as their speed, clarity, and fluency. Rapid, mumbled, or heavily accented speech may be more challenging for the model to transcribe accurately.\n\n6. Recording quality: The quality of the audio recording, including factors like microphone quality, audio compression, and sampling rate, can impact the model's ability to accurately process and transcribe speech.\n\nUnderstanding these domain and context characteristics can help users anticipate potential limitations and adapt their usage of the openai/whisper-base model accordingly.", "The openai/whisper-base model is a speech recognition model trained on a diverse dataset, but its performance may still be influenced by certain population subgroup characteristics:\n\n1. Language and accent: While the model is trained on multiple languages, it may perform better on some languages and accents than others, depending on the representation of those languages and accents in the training data.\n\n2. Age: The model's performance may vary depending on the age of the speaker, as children and elderly individuals often have different speech patterns and vocal characteristics compared to adults.\n\n3. Speech disabilities: Individuals with speech disabilities or impairments may experience lower accuracy rates, as their speech patterns may deviate from the typical patterns the model was trained on.\n\n4. Background noise and recording quality: The model's performance can be affected by background noise and the quality of the audio recording, which may be more prevalent in certain populations or environments.\n\n5. Domain-specific terminology: If the model is applied to a specific domain (e.g., medical or legal), it may perform better on individuals who use the terminology and jargon associated with that domain.\n\nTo mitigate these potential biases, it is essential to continuously monitor the model's performance across different population subgroups and update the training data to ensure better representation and inclusivity.", "Based on the available information about the openai/whisper-base model, it is unclear whether the evaluation of the model's performance has been disaggregated across various factors to uncover potential disparities. The OpenAI Whisper model documentation does not provide detailed insights into the evaluation methodology or any analysis of performance disparities across different demographic groups, accents, or languages. To comprehensively answer this question, more information would be needed from OpenAI regarding their testing and evaluation processes for the Whisper model. It is important for organizations developing AI models to carefully assess and report on performance across diverse populations to ensure fairness and identify any biases or limitations."]}

Evaluation should ideally be disaggregated across factors in order to uncover disparities in performance.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model openai/whisper-base.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the openai/whisper-base model, here are some key foreseeable characteristics that may influence the model's behavior and performance:\n\n1. Language and amount of training data: The model's performance on a given language is strongly correlated with the amount of training data available for that language. The current pre-training dataset is English-heavy, so the model likely performs better on English compared to lower-resource languages (Reference 2).\n\n2. Domain and context: The model may struggle with domain-specific terminology or contexts that are underrepresented in the training data. Fine-tuning on high-quality supervised datasets from specific domains could help improve performance (Reference 1).\n\n3. Audio quality and noise: The model's performance may degrade when dealing with noisy audio or audio from challenging environments like pubs or restaurants. Testing the model's robustness to white noise and pub noise additions could reveal disparities in performance (Reference 6).\n\n4. Speaker demographics: [More Information Needed] The references do not directly address performance disparities across speaker demographics like age, gender, or accent.\n\n5. Transcript formatting: The model's zero-shot performance may be impacted by variations in transcript formatting across datasets, as it does not observe dataset-specific formatting examples during training (Reference 8).\n\n6. Evaluation metrics: Standard evaluation metrics like WER may not always correlate well with human judgment, especially for zero-shot models. Developing better evaluation metrics is an active research area (Reference 8).\n\nTo uncover potential performance disparities, the model should be evaluated on a diverse range of datasets covering different languages, domains, audio qualities, and speaker demographics. Disaggregated evaluation results would provide a clearer picture of the model's strengths and weaknesses."}

Word Error Rate (WER): This measures the accuracy of the speech recognition by comparing the transcribed text to the reference text. It calculates the number of word substitutions, deletions, and insertions needed to transform the transcribed text into the reference text, divided by the total number of words in the reference. Lower WER indicates better performance.\n\n2. Character Error Rate (CER): Similar to WER, but operates at the character level instead of the word level. It measures the number of character edits required to match the reference text.\n\n3. Perplexity: This evaluates the language model component of the speech recognition system. It measures how well the model predicts the next word in a sequence. Lower perplexity suggests the model is better at predicting the correct words.\n\n4. Inference time: This measures how long it takes for the model to process and transcribe a given audio sample. Faster inference times are desirable for real-time applications.\n\n5. Robustness to noise and accents: The model's performance can be evaluated on audio samples with varying levels of background noise and different speaker accents to assess its resilience in real-world scenarios.\n\nThese metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the openai/whisper-base model's performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.", "When considering the tradeoffs between different errors in the openai/whisper-base model, it's important to understand that this model is designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks. The main types of errors that can occur in ASR models are:\n\n1. Substitution errors: When the model incorrectly transcribes a word or phrase, replacing it with a different word or phrase.\n\n2. Deletion errors: When the model fails to transcribe a word or phrase that is present in the audio.\n\n3. Insertion errors: When the model transcribes a word or phrase that is not actually present in the audio.\n\nThe tradeoffs between these errors depend on the specific use case and the user's priorities. For example, in a scenario where the accuracy of each word is crucial (such as legal or medical transcription), substitution and insertion errors may be more problematic than deletion errors. On the other hand, if the goal is to capture the overall meaning of the speech (such as in a general conversation transcription), deletion errors might be more acceptable than substitution or insertion errors.\n\nMoreover, the openai/whisper-base model is a base model, which means it is smaller and faster than larger variants but may have slightly lower accuracy. Users can fine-tune this model on their specific data to improve performance and potentially reduce certain types of errors that are more critical for their use case. The choice of the base model versus larger models will depend on the available computational resources, the size of the dataset, and the required inference speed."]}

Whisper models which we investigate in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others study the performance of speech recognition systems in out-of-distribution settings.\n2. To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification. The diminishing returns for English speech recognition could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9\n3. The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech processing system that works reliably without the need for dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across domains, tasks, and languages.

This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an active area of research, and while there are some promising methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation to minimize penalization of\n5. Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric. However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model's output and the reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses a problem for all transcribers, it is\n6. Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close Whisper's performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5 services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides\n7. Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages As Figure 3 shows, Whisper's speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages.

The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000 hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could be further improved by a combination of longer training and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing the end of performance improvements from dataset size scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to characterize \"scaling laws\" for\n4. To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification. The diminishing returns for English speech recognition could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9\n5. We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000;Chen et al., 2016). Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013) with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256\n6. Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages As Figure 3 shows, Whisper's speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount of training data for the language. Since our pre-training dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have\n7. To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%. However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.\n8. Whisper's performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a performance breakdown of `large-v3` and `large-v2` models by language, using WERs (word error rates) or CER (character error rates, shown in *Italic*) evaluated on the Common Voice 15 and Fleurs datasets.

The self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture long-range dependencies.\n\nThe decoder takes the hidden representations generated by the encoder and produces the output text. It also utilizes multi-head attention layers, but in addition to self-attention, it also performs cross-attention between the decoder hidden states and the encoder outputs. This allows the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input audio when generating each output token.\n\nThe openai/whisper-base model has approximately 71 million parameters, making it a relatively compact model compared to larger variants in the Whisper family. It is trained on a diverse dataset of multilingual and multitask data, enabling it to perform speech recognition in multiple languages and adapt to various accents and speaking styles.\n\nOverall, the openai/whisper-base model leverages the power of transformer architecture to achieve high-quality speech recognition results in a compact and efficient package.", "The objective of the model \"openai/whisper-base\" is to perform automatic speech recognition (ASR) and transcribe spoken language into written text.
