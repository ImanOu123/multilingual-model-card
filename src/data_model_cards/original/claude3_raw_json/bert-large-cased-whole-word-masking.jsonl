The bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking model is a specific variant of BERT with the following architectural details:\n\n1. It is a large model, which means it has a higher number of parameters compared to the base version, enabling it to capture more complex language patterns.\n\n2. The model is cased, indicating that it is sensitive to the capitalization of words, which can be beneficial for certain natural language processing tasks.\n\n3. It employs whole word masking during the pre-training phase. Instead of masking individual subwords or tokens, whole word masking masks entire words at once. This approach aims to improve the model's understanding of word-level semantics and context.\n\n4. BERT utilizes a bidirectional Transformer architecture, allowing it to consider both left and right context when processing each word in a sequence. This bidirectional context enables the model to capture more comprehensive language representations.\n\n5. The model consists of multiple Transformer encoder layers stacked on top of each other. Each layer applies self-attention mechanisms to compute contextualized word embeddings by attending to all other words in the input sequence.\n\nOverall, the bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking model combines a large-scale architecture with whole word masking and a cased vocabulary to provide robust language understanding capabilities for various natural language processing tasks.", "The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, specifically \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking,\" is a pre-trained language model developed by Google. It is trained on a large corpus of English text using unsupervised learning techniques.\n\nThe training procedure involves two main tasks:\n\n1. Masked Language Modeling (MLM): In this task, a certain percentage of input tokens are randomly masked, and the model is trained to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based on its context. In the case of \"whole-word-masking,\" instead of masking individual subwords, all of the subwords corresponding to a word are masked at once.\n\n2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP): In this task, the model is presented with pairs of sentences and learns to predict whether the second sentence follows the first sentence in the original document. This helps the model understand sentence relationships.\n\nThe \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" model is a large variant with 24 layers (transformer blocks), 16 attention heads, and 340M parameters. It is trained on cased English text, meaning it is case-sensitive. The model is trained using the BookCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words) datasets.\n\nThe pre-training process allows the model to learn deep bidirectional representations, capturing both left and right context in all layers. This pre-trained model can then be fine-tuned with additional output layers to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, question answering, and language inference.", "The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model named \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" is a large-sized variant of the BERT architecture.

Total number of parameters: 340M\n\nThis model is pre-trained on a large corpus of English data using the masked language modeling (MLM) objective, with whole word masking applied during the pre-training process. Whole word masking ensures that all tokens corresponding to a word are masked at once, which can lead to improved performance on downstream tasks.\n\nThe term \"cased\" in the model name indicates that the model is case-sensitive, meaning it differentiates between uppercase and lowercase letters. This model can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, question answering, and named entity recognition.", "When using the BERT model \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\", it's important to keep a few key disclaimers in mind:\n\nThis model is pre-trained and may reflect biases present in the training data. Its outputs can potentially contain biased, offensive, or factually incorrect content. Results should be carefully reviewed.\n\nThe model is cased, meaning it is case-sensitive and expects cased input. Feeding it lowercase text may degrade performance.  \n\nIt uses whole word masking, where all tokens corresponding to a word are masked at once during pre-training. This can impact fine-tuning on certain downstream tasks.\n\nAs a large model, it is computationally expensive to run, requiring significant memory and processing power. Deploying it at scale may be costly.\n\nWhile powerful, the model has limitations and should be used as a tool to assist and augment human intelligence and decision making, not as a sole authority. Outputs are not guaranteed to be factual, unbiased, or safe. Human oversight is advised."]}

The bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking model is a specific variant of BERT with the following architectural details:\n\n1. It is a large model, which means it has a higher number of parameters compared to the base version, enabling it to capture more complex language patterns.\n\n2. The model is cased, indicating that it is sensitive to the capitalization of words, which can be beneficial for certain natural language processing tasks.\n\n3. It employs whole word masking during the pre-training phase. Instead of masking individual subwords or tokens, whole word masking masks entire words at once. This approach aims to improve the model's understanding of word-level semantics and context.\n\n4. BERT utilizes a bidirectional Transformer architecture, allowing it to consider both left and right context when processing each word in a sequence. This bidirectional context enables the model to capture more comprehensive language representations.\n\n5. The model consists of multiple Transformer encoder layers stacked on top of each other. Each layer applies self-attention mechanisms to compute contextualized word embeddings by attending to all other words in the input sequence.\n\nOverall, the bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking model combines a large-scale architecture with whole word masking and a cased vocabulary to provide robust language understanding capabilities for various natural language processing tasks.", "The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, specifically \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking,\" is a pre-trained language model developed by Google.

Masked Language Modeling (MLM): In this task, a certain percentage of input tokens are randomly masked, and the model is trained to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based on its context. In the case of \"whole-word-masking,\" instead of masking individual subwords, all of the subwords corresponding to a word are masked at once.\n\n2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP): In this task, the model is presented with pairs of sentences and learns to predict whether the second sentence follows the first sentence in the original document.

To mitigate this, we do not always replace \"masked\" words with the actual [MASK] token. The training data generator chooses 15% of the token positions at random for prediction.

BERT was built upon recent work in pre-training contextual representations \u2014\nincluding [Semi-supervised Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01432),\n[Generative Pre-Training](https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/),\n[ELMo](https://allennlp.org/elmo), and\n[ULMFit](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html)\n\u2014 but crucially these models are all *unidirectional* or *shallowly\nbidirectional*. This means that each word is only contextualized using the words\n3. BERT BASE was chosen to have the same model size as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes. Critically, however, the BERT Transformer uses bidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Transformer uses constrained self-attention where every token can only attend to context to its left. 4 Input/Output Representations To make BERT handle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input representation is able to unambiguously represent both a single sentence and a pair of sentences (e.g., Question, Answer ) in one token\n4. BERT uses a simple approach for this: We mask out 15% of the words in the input,\nrun the entire sequence through a deep bidirectional\n[Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) encoder, and then predict only\nthe masked words. For example:\n\n```\nInput: the man went to the [MASK1] . he bought a [MASK2] of milk.\nLabels: [MASK1] = store; [MASK2] = gallon\n```\n5. We then train a large model (12-layer to 24-layer Transformer) on a large corpus\n(Wikipedia + [BookCorpus](http://yknzhu.wixsite.com/mbweb)) for a long time (1M\nupdate steps), and that's BERT.\n\nUsing BERT has two stages: *Pre-training* and *fine-tuning*.\n6. Unlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al. (2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or right-to-left language models to pre-train BERT. Instead, we pre-train BERT using two unsupervised tasks, described in this section. This step is presented in the left part of Figure 1.\n7. In order to train a deep bidirectional representation, we simply mask some percentage of the input tokens at random, and then predict those masked tokens. We refer to this procedure as a \"masked LM\" (MLM), although it is often referred to as a Cloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this case, the final hidden vectors corresponding to the mask tokens are fed into an output softmax over the vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our experiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece tokens in each\n8. Task #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reasonable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is strictly more powerful than either a left-to-right model or the shallow concatenation of a left-toright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately, standard conditional language models can only be trained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirectional conditioning would allow each word to indirectly \"see itself\", and the model could trivially predict the target word in a multi-layered context.\n9. We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a;Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for\n10. In this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a \"masked language model\" (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. Unlike\n11. **BERT**, or **B**idirectional **E**ncoder **R**epresentations from\n**T**ransformers, is a new method of pre-training language representations which\nobtains state-of-the-art results on a wide array of Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) tasks.\n\nOur academic paper which describes BERT in detail and provides full results on a\nnumber of tasks can be found here:\n[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide basic details about the model bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking.

In this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a \"masked language model\" (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. Unlike\n8. BERT was built upon recent work in pre-training contextual representations \u2014\nincluding [Semi-supervised Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01432),\n[Generative Pre-Training](https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/),\n[ELMo](https://allennlp.org/elmo), and\n[ULMFit](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html)\n\u2014 but crucially these models are all *unidirectional* or *shallowly\nbidirectional*. This means that each word is only contextualized using the words\n9.

BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a \"masked language model\" (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953).

In Section 3.1, we mention that BERT uses a mixed strategy for masking the target tokens when pre-training with the masked language model (MLM) objective. The following is an ablation study to evaluate the effect of different masking strategies. Note that the purpose of the masking strategies is to reduce the mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never appears during the fine-tuning stage. We report the Dev results for both MNLI and NER. For NER, we report both fine-tuning and\n11. *   **[`BERT-Large, Uncased (Whole Word Masking)`](https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2019_05_30/wwm_uncased_L-24_H-1024_A-16.zip)**:\n    24-layer, 1024-hidden, 16-heads, 340M parameters\n\n*   **[`BERT-Large, Cased (Whole Word Masking)`](https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2019_05_30/wwm_cased_L-24_H-1024_A-16.zip)**:\n    24-layer, 1024-hidden, 16-heads, 340M parameters\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nSummarize the type of the model bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking in terms of the training method, machine learning type, and modality in one sentence.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking.

This is possible because BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data using unsupervised learning techniques, allowing it to capture rich linguistic information and understand the context of words in a sentence.\n\nOne common approach to using BERT without fine-tuning is through feature extraction. In this method, the pre-trained BERT model is used to generate embeddings (numerical representations) for the input text. These embeddings can then be used as input features for downstream tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or named entity recognition. By leveraging the pre-trained weights of BERT, the model can effectively encode the semantic and syntactic information of the text, which can be beneficial for the target task.\n\nAnother way to utilize BERT without fine-tuning is through zero-shot learning. In this approach, the model's inherent language understanding capabilities are exploited to perform tasks it was not explicitly trained for. For example, by providing a prompt or a few examples, BERT can be used to generate text, answer questions, or perform text completion without the need for task-specific fine-tuning.\n\nIt's important to note that while using BERT without fine-tuning can yield good results, fine-tuning the model on a specific task using labeled data often leads to better performance. Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt its pre-trained knowledge to the specific nuances and requirements of the target task.", "The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, specifically the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" variant, can be used without post-processing for various natural language processing tasks. This model has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text data using the masked language modeling (MLM) objective, which allows it to learn contextual representations of words.\n\nOne of the key advantages of using this model is that it can be fine-tuned on downstream tasks without the need for extensive post-processing. By leveraging the pre-trained weights of the model, you can directly fine-tune it on your specific task, such as text classification, named entity recognition, or question answering, using a relatively small amount of labeled data.\n\nDuring fine-tuning, you can add a task-specific output layer on top of the pre-trained BERT model and train the entire model end-to-end. The model's architecture and pre-trained weights remain unchanged, allowing it to capture the contextual information learned during pre-training.\n\nOnce fine-tuned, the model can be directly applied to new, unseen data without requiring any post-processing steps. The fine-tuned model can generate predictions or embeddings that can be used for the target task. This eliminates the need for additional feature engineering or complex post-processing pipelines, simplifying the deployment and usage of the model in real-world applications.\n\nIt's important to note that the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" model is cased, meaning it is sensitive to the capitalization of words, and it uses whole word masking during pre-training, which can lead to improved performance on certain tasks compared to models trained with subword masking.", "The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, specifically the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" variant, can be used without plugging into a pipeline by directly utilizing the model's architecture and pre-trained weights. Here's how you can use the model independently:\n\n1. Load the pre-trained model: Start by loading the pre-trained BERT model using a deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. You can download the model weights and configuration files from the official BERT repository or through the framework's model hub.\n\n2. Tokenize the input: Preprocess your input text by tokenizing it using the BERT tokenizer. The tokenizer will split the text into subword units (e.g., WordPiece tokens) and add special tokens like [CLS] and [SEP] to mark the beginning and end of the input sequence.\n\n3. Create input tensors: Convert the tokenized input into tensors that can be fed into the BERT model. This typically involves creating input IDs (numeric representation of tokens), attention masks (indicating which tokens should be attended to), and token type IDs (distinguishing different segments of the input, if applicable).\n\n4. Forward pass through the model: Pass the input tensors through the BERT model to obtain the contextualized embeddings. The model will generate hidden states for each token in the input sequence, capturing the contextual information.\n\n5. Extract relevant embeddings: Depending on your task, you may want to extract specific embeddings from the model's output. For example, you can use the embedding of the [CLS] token for sequence-level classification tasks or the embeddings of individual tokens for token-level tasks like named entity recognition.\n\n6. Fine-tune or use embeddings: If you have labeled data for a specific task, you can fine-tune the BERT model by adding task-specific layers on top of the pre-trained model and training it further. Alternatively, you can use the extracted embeddings as input features for other machine learning models or downstream tasks.\n\nBy following these steps, you can leverage the power of the BERT model without relying on a pre-built pipeline. This allows for more flexibility and customization based on your specific requirements. However, it's important to note that using the model directly requires a deeper understanding of the model architecture and the specific task you are targeting.", "Certainly! Here's a short passage that answers the question about the model \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" and provides a code snippet to demonstrate its usage:\n\nThe \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" model is a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model that utilizes whole word masking during the pre-training process. This model is particularly useful for tasks such as named entity recognition, question answering, and text classification.\n\nTo use this model, you can leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python. Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to load and use the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" model for a simple text classification task:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification\nimport torch\n\n# Load the tokenizer and model\ntokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking')\nmodel = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking')\n\n# Define the input text\ntext = \"This movie was absolutely amazing!\"\n\n# Tokenize the input text\ninputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')\n\n# Pass the inputs through the model\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# Get the predicted class probabilities\nprobabilities = torch.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=1)\n\n# Print the predicted class\npredicted_class = torch.argmax(probabilities).item()\nprint(\"Predicted class:\", predicted_class)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, we first load the tokenizer and model using the `from_pretrained()` method from the Hugging Face Transformers library. We then define an input text and tokenize it using the loaded tokenizer. The tokenized inputs are passed through the model to obtain the output logits. Finally, we apply softmax to the logits to get the predicted class probabilities and print the predicted class.\n\nBy utilizing the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" model, you can leverage its pre-trained knowledge for various natural language processing tasks and fine-tune it further on your specific dataset to achieve better performance."]}

{"question": "direct_use", "chain": "retrieval", "prompt": ["The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, specifically the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" variant, can be used without fine-tuning for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This is possible because BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data using unsupervised learning techniques, allowing it to capture rich linguistic information and understand the context of words in a sentence.\n\nOne common approach to using BERT without fine-tuning is through feature extraction. In this method, the pre-trained BERT model is used to generate embeddings (numerical representations) for the input text. These embeddings can then be used as input features for downstream tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or named entity recognition. By leveraging the pre-trained weights of BERT, the model can effectively encode the semantic and syntactic information of the text, which can be beneficial for the target task.\n\nAnother way to utilize BERT without fine-tuning is through zero-shot learning. In this approach, the model's inherent language understanding capabilities are exploited to perform tasks it was not explicitly trained for. For example, by providing a prompt or a few examples, BERT can be used to generate text, answer questions, or perform text completion without the need for task-specific fine-tuning.\n\nIt's important to note that while using BERT without fine-tuning can yield good results, fine-tuning the model on a specific task using labeled data often leads to better performance. Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt its pre-trained knowledge to the specific nuances and requirements of the target task.", "The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, specifically the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" variant, can be used without post-processing for various natural language processing tasks. This model has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text data using the masked language modeling (MLM) objective, which allows it to learn contextual representations of words.\n\nOne of the key advantages of using this model is that it can be fine-tuned on downstream tasks without the need for extensive post-processing. By leveraging the pre-trained weights of the model, you can directly fine-tune it on your specific task, such as text classification, named entity recognition, or question answering, using a relatively small amount of labeled data.\n\nDuring fine-tuning, you can add a task-specific output layer on top of the pre-trained BERT model and train the entire model end-to-end. The model's architecture and pre-trained weights remain unchanged, allowing it to capture the contextual information learned during pre-training.\n\nOnce fine-tuned, the model can be directly applied to new, unseen data without requiring any post-processing steps. The fine-tuned model can generate predictions or embeddings that can be used for the target task. This eliminates the need for additional feature engineering or complex post-processing pipelines, simplifying the deployment and usage of the model in real-world applications.\n\nIt's important to note that the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" model is cased, meaning it is sensitive to the capitalization of words, and it uses whole word masking during pre-training, which can lead to improved performance on certain tasks compared to models trained with subword masking.", "The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, specifically the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" variant, can be used without plugging into a pipeline by directly utilizing the model's architecture and pre-trained weights.

You can download the model weights and configuration files from the official BERT repository or through the framework's model hub.\n\n2. Tokenize the input: Preprocess your input text by tokenizing it using the BERT tokenizer. The tokenizer will split the text into subword units (e.g., WordPiece tokens) and add special tokens like [CLS] and [SEP] to mark the beginning and end of the input sequence.\n\n3. Create input tensors: Convert the tokenized input into tensors that can be fed into the BERT model. This typically involves creating input IDs (numeric representation of tokens), attention masks (indicating which tokens should be attended to), and token type IDs (distinguishing different segments of the input, if applicable).\n\n4. Forward pass through the model: Pass the input tensors through the BERT model to obtain the contextualized embeddings. The model will generate hidden states for each token in the input sequence, capturing the contextual information.\n\n5. Extract relevant embeddings: Depending on your task, you may want to extract specific embeddings from the model's output. For example, you can use the embedding of the [CLS] token for sequence-level classification tasks or the embeddings of individual tokens for token-level tasks like named entity recognition.\n\n6. Fine-tune or use embeddings: If you have labeled data for a specific task, you can fine-tune the BERT model by adding task-specific layers on top of the pre-trained model and training it further. Alternatively, you can use the extracted embeddings as input features for other machine learning models or downstream tasks.\n\nBy following these steps, you can leverage the power of the BERT model without relying on a pre-built pipeline.

All of the BERT results presented so far have used the fine-tuning approach, where a simple classification layer is added to the pre-trained model, and all parameters are jointly fine-tuned on a downstream task. However, the feature-based approach, where fixed features are extracted from the pretrained model, has certain advantages. First, not all tasks can be easily represented by a Transformer encoder architecture, and therefore require a task-specific model architecture to be added. Second, there are\n2. To ablate the fine-tuning approach, we apply the feature-based approach by extracting the activations from one or more layers without fine-tuning any parameters of BERT. These contextual embeddings are used as input to a randomly initialized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before the classification layer.\n3. Results are presented in Table 7. BERT LARGE performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods. The best performing method concatenates the token representations from the top four hidden layers of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only 0.3 F1 behind fine-tuning the entire model. This demonstrates that BERT is effective for both finetuning and feature-based approaches.\n4. In this section, we compare the two approaches by applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we use a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we include the maximal document context provided by the data. Following standard practice, we formulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF   layer in the output. We use the representation of the first sub-token as the input to the token-level classifier over the NER label set.\n5. benchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including question answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning contextual representations through a task to predict a single word from both left and right context using LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is feature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus et al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used to improve the robustness\n6.

In this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a \"masked language model\" (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. Unlike\n9. BERT is a method of pre-training language representations, meaning that we train\na general-purpose \"language understanding\" model on a large text corpus (like\nWikipedia), and then use that model for downstream NLP tasks that we care about\n(like question answering). BERT outperforms previous methods because it is the\nfirst *unsupervised*, *deeply bidirectional* system for pre-training NLP.\n10. \u2022 We show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered taskspecific architectures. BERT is the first finetuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specific architectures.\n\u2022 BERT advances the state of the art for eleven NLP tasks.

The model is then trained on the task-specific dataset, allowing it to learn the nuances and patterns specific to that task while leveraging the broad language understanding it gained during pre-training.\n\nSome examples of tasks that the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" model can be fine-tuned for include:\n\n1. Text classification: Identifying the sentiment, topic, or intent of a given text.\n2. Named entity recognition: Identifying and categorizing named entities such as people, organizations, and locations within a text.\n3. Question answering: Providing answers to questions based on a given context.\n4. Text summarization: Generating concise summaries of longer texts while preserving key information.\n\nBy fine-tuning the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" model, developers can create high-performance NLP applications tailored to their specific use cases while benefiting from the model's pre-existing language understanding capabilities.", "The BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, specifically the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" variant, can be seamlessly integrated into a larger ecosystem or application to enhance various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

By leveraging the pre-trained weights of the model, developers can quickly adapt it to their specific use case with minimal additional training data.\n\nFor example, in a customer support application, the BERT model can be used to automatically classify incoming user queries into predefined categories, route them to the appropriate support team, and even suggest relevant answers based on the context of the question. Similarly, in a content recommendation system, BERT can analyze user preferences and the content of articles or products to provide personalized recommendations.\n\nThe \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" model is particularly well-suited for applications that require an understanding of case-sensitive text and whole words, as it was trained using a technique called whole word masking.

For each task, we simply plug in the taskspecific inputs and outputs into BERT and finetune all the parameters end-to-end. At the input, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training are analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphrasing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3) question-passage pairs in question answering, and (4) a degenerate text-\u2205 pair in text classification or sequence tagging. At the output, the token representations are fed into an output layer for tokenlevel tasks, such as\n2. For applications involving text pairs, a common pattern is to independently encode text pairs before applying bidirectional cross attention, such as Parikh et al. ( 2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT instead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify these two stages, as encoding a concatenated text pair with self-attention effectively includes bidirectional cross attention between two sentences.\n3. Fine-tuning is straightforward since the selfattention mechanism in the Transformer allows BERT to model many downstream taskswhether they involve single text or text pairs-by swapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\n4. A few other pre-trained models are implemented off-the-shelf in\n`run_classifier.py`, so it should be straightforward to follow those examples to\nuse BERT for any single-sentence or sentence-pair classification task.\n\nNote: You might see a message `Running train on CPU`. This really just means\nthat it's running on something other than a Cloud TPU, which includes a GPU.\n5. Before running this example you must download the\n[GLUE data](https://gluebenchmark.com/tasks) by running\n[this script](https://gist.github.com/W4ngatang/60c2bdb54d156a41194446737ce03e2e)\nand unpack it to some directory `$GLUE_DIR`. Next, download the `BERT-Base`\ncheckpoint and unzip it to some directory `$BERT_BASE_DIR`.\n\nThis example code fine-tunes `BERT-Base` on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase\nCorpus (MRPC) corpus, which only contains 3,600 examples and can fine-tune in a\nfew minutes on most GPUs.\n6. In certain cases, rather than fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model\nend-to-end, it can be beneficial to obtained *pre-trained contextual\nembeddings*, which are fixed contextual representations of each input token\ngenerated from the hidden layers of the pre-trained model. This should also\nmitigate most of the out-of-memory issues.\n\nAs an example, we include the script `extract_features.py` which can be used\nlike this:\n\n```shell\n7. sequence tagging or question answering, and the [CLS] representation is fed into an output layer for classification, such as entailment or sentiment analysis.\n8.

More information is needed on the specific pre-training data used, but in general large language models can generate convincing text that is incorrect or reflects problematic biases.\n\nThe model should not be used as a sole decision making tool for high-stakes applications like healthcare, finance, criminal justice, etc. without extensive testing, human oversight, and alignment with domain-specific guidelines. Relying on it in sensitive domains could lead to harm.\n\nUsers should clearly disclose they are using the whole-word masking variant of BERT-large in any papers or applications, to avoid confusion with the original model. Lack of transparency around which specific model is used could be seen as misleading.\n\n[More Information Needed] on other potential misuse cases specific to the whole-word masking pre-training approach used in this variant.\n\nIn general, users have an ethical obligation to carefully evaluate the impacts and limitations of using this powerful model, be transparent about its usage, and proactively mitigate risks of misuse that could cause societal harm or amplify discrimination against marginalized groups.

Some potential harms and risks that could stem from a model like this include:\n\n- The model may exhibit biases present in its training data, which could lead to biased or unfair outputs when used in applications. Large web-scraped datasets often contain societal biases.\n\n- There are risks of the model being used to generate misinformation, propaganda, hateful content, or other harmful language, since it has likely been trained on a broad corpus of web data. Appropriate safeguards would be needed.\n\n- The computational costs and environmental impact of training and deploying such a large model may be substantial. The energy usage has negative environmental consequences.\n\n- There are potential issues related to intellectual property and data privacy, depending on the exact data the model was trained on.

As a large model, it may have high computational requirements for inference which could be misunderstood as making it impractical to use in some applications.\n\n2. The cased tokenization means it is case-sensitive, which if misunderstood could lead to incorrect usage for case-insensitive applications. \n\n3. Whole word masking allows the model to learn relationships between words rather than just subword tokens. However, this could potentially be misunderstood as making the model less effective at handling rare words or word pieces.\n\n4.

The first sentence receives the A embedding and the second receives the B embedding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A and 50% of the time it is a random sentence, which is done for the \"next sentence prediction\" task.

Casing: Since the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" model is cased, the original casing of the input text is preserved. This means that the model is sensitive to the capitalization of words.\n\n3. Whole Word Masking: During the preprocessing for training, the model applies whole word masking. Instead of masking individual subword tokens, whole words are masked together. This helps the model learn better contextual representations of complete words rather than just subword units.\n\n4. Sequence Length Limitation: The input sequences are typically limited to a maximum length (e.g., 512 tokens) to fit within the model's input size constraints. Longer sequences are either truncated or split into multiple segments.\n\n5. Special Tokens: Special tokens such as \"[CLS]\" (classification token) and \"[SEP]\" (separator token) are added to the input sequence. The \"[CLS]\" token is added at the beginning of the sequence, and the \"[SEP]\" token is used to separate different parts of the input, such as sentences or document segments.\n\n6. Padding: If the input sequence is shorter than the maximum sequence length, it is padded with special \"[PAD]\" tokens to reach the desired length.\n\n7. Attention Mask: An attention mask is created to indicate which tokens in the input sequence are actual tokens and which are padding tokens. This mask helps the model focus on the relevant parts of the input during training and inference.\n\nThese preprocessing steps are crucial for the \"bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking\" model to effectively process and understand the input data. The specific preprocessing pipeline may vary depending on the implementation and the task at hand, but the general steps remain the same."], "answer": ["In this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.

The following is an ablation study to evaluate the effect of different masking strategies.

We report the Dev results for both MNLI and NER. For NER, we report both fine-tuning and", "We use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al., 2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary.

We differentiate the sentences in two ways. First, we separate them with a special token ([SEP]).

Before we describe the general recipe for handling word-level tasks, it's\nimportant to understand what exactly our tokenizer is doing. It has three main\nsteps:\n\n1.  **Text normalization**: Convert all whitespace characters to spaces, and\n    (for the `Uncased` model) lowercase the input and strip out accent markers.\n    E.g., `John Johanson's, \u2192 john johanson's,`.\n2. For sentence-level tasks (or sentence-pair) tasks, tokenization is very simple.\nJust follow the example code in `run_classifier.py` and `extract_features.py`.\nThe basic procedure for sentence-level tasks is:\n\n1.  Instantiate an instance of `tokenizer = tokenization.FullTokenizer`\n\n2.  Tokenize the raw text with `tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(raw_text)`.\n\n3.  Truncate to the maximum sequence length. (You can use up to 512, but you\n    probably want to use shorter if possible for memory and speed reasons.)\n3. 4.  Add the `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens in the right place.\n\nWord-level and span-level tasks (e.g., SQuAD and NER) are more complex, since\nyou need to maintain alignment between your input text and output text so that\nyou can project your training labels. SQuAD is a particularly complex example\nbecause the input labels are *character*-based, and SQuAD paragraphs are often\nlonger than our maximum sequence length. See the code in `run_squad.py` to show\nhow we handle this.\n4. The advantage of this scheme is that it is \"compatible\" with most existing\nEnglish tokenizers. For example, imagine that you have a part-of-speech tagging\ntask which looks like this:\n\n```\nInput:  John Johanson 's   house\nLabels: NNP  NNP      POS NN\n```\n\nThe tokenized output will look like this:\n\n```\nTokens: john johan ##son ' s house\n```\n\nCrucially, this would be the same output as if the raw text were `John\nJohanson's house` (with no space before the `'s`).\n5. If you have a pre-tokenized representation with word-level annotations, you can\nsimply tokenize each input word independently, and deterministically maintain an\noriginal-to-tokenized alignment:\n\n```python\n6. The pre-training procedure largely follows the existing literature on language model pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we use the BooksCorpus (800M words)  and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages and ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is critical to use a document-level corpus rather than a shuffled sentence-level corpus such as the Billion Word Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to extract long contiguous sequences.\n7.

For each task, we simply plug in the taskspecific inputs and outputs into BERT and finetune all the parameters end-to-end. At the input, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training are analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphrasing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3) question-passage pairs in question answering, and (4) a degenerate text-\u2205 pair in text classification or sequence tagging. At the output, the token representations are fed into an output layer for tokenlevel tasks, such as\n2. For applications involving text pairs, a common pattern is to independently encode text pairs before applying bidirectional cross attention, such as Parikh et al. ( 2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT instead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify these two stages, as encoding a concatenated text pair with self-attention effectively includes bidirectional cross attention between two sentences.\n3. The pre-training procedure largely follows the existing literature on language model pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we use the BooksCorpus (800M words)  and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages and ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is critical to use a document-level corpus rather than a shuffled sentence-level corpus such as the Billion Word Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to extract long contiguous sequences.\n4. Fine-tuning is straightforward since the selfattention mechanism in the Transformer allows BERT to model many downstream taskswhether they involve single text or text pairs-by swapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\n5. In this section, we present BERT fine-tuning results on 11 NLP tasks.\n6. BERT was built upon recent work in pre-training contextual representations \u2014\nincluding [Semi-supervised Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01432),\n[Generative Pre-Training](https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/),\n[ELMo](https://allennlp.org/elmo), and\n[ULMFit](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html)\n\u2014 but crucially these models are all *unidirectional* or *shallowly\nbidirectional*. This means that each word is only contextualized using the words\n7. This can be enabled during data generation by passing the flag\n`--do_whole_word_mask=True` to `create_pretraining_data.py`.\n\nPre-trained models with Whole Word Masking are linked below.

When using\nthese models, please make it clear in the paper that you are using the Whole\nWord Masking variant of BERT-Large.\n8. In this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a \"masked language model\" (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context.

Performance may vary when applied to domains or contexts that differ significantly from these sources. [More Information Needed] on specific domain/context performance.\n\n- The model uses a document-level corpus for pre-training to extract long contiguous sequences. Behavior may be impacted when applied to shorter, non-contiguous text.\n\nPopulation Subgroups:\n[More Information Needed]\nThe references do not provide information to assess performance disparities across population subgroups. Disaggregated evaluation would be needed to uncover any such differences.\n\nOther Influential Factors:\n- The model uses whole word masking during pre-training (`--do_whole_word_mask=True`). This may impact performance compared to models using subword/wordpiece masking.\n\n- BERT uses bidirectional self-attention, allowing it to incorporate context from both directions. This is a key architectural difference from unidirectional or shallowly bidirectional models that may affect behavior.\n\nTo fully characterize model behavior, additional disaggregated evaluation across relevant factors would be beneficial, as many details are not covered in the provided references.

The score of a candidate span from position i to position j is defined as S\u2022T i + E\u2022T j , and the maximum scoring span where j \u2265 i is used as a prediction. The training objective is the sum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and end positions. We fine-tune for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\n3. The General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a collection of diverse natural language understanding tasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are included in Appendix B.1.\n4. over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each task, we selected the best fine-tuning learning rate (among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set. Additionally, for BERT LARGE we found that finetuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets, so we ran several random restarts and selected the best model on the Dev set. With random restarts, we use the same pre-trained checkpoint but perform different fine-tuning data shuffling and classifier layer initialization. 9 Results are presented in Table 1. Both\n5. We find that BERT LARGE significantly outperforms BERT BASE across all tasks, especially those with very little training data. The effect of model size is explored more thoroughly in Section 5.2.\n6. We demonstrate the importance of the deep bidirectionality of BERT by evaluating two pretraining objectives using exactly the same pretraining data, fine-tuning scheme, and hyperparameters as BERT BASE :\nNo NSP: A bidirectional model which is trained using the \"masked LM\" (MLM) but without the \"next sentence prediction\" (NSP) task.\n7. It has long been known that increasing the model size will lead to continual improvements on large-scale tasks such as machine translation and language modeling, which is demonstrated by the LM perplexity of held-out training data shown in Table 6. However, we believe that this is the first work to demonstrate convincingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also leads to large improvements on very small scale tasks, provided that the model has been sufficiently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented\n8. the existing literature. For example, the largest Transformer explored in Vaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16) with 100M parameters for the encoder, and the largest Transformer we have found in the literature is (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters (Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERT BASE contains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE contains 340M parameters.\n9. a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to\n10. The illustration of fine-tuning BERT on different tasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-specific models are formed by incorporating BERT with one additional output layer, so a minimal number of parameters need to be learned from scratch. Among the tasks, Our GLUE results in Table1 are obtained from https://gluebenchmark.com/ leaderboard and https://blog. openai.com/language-unsupervised. The GLUE benchmark includes the following datasets, the descriptions of which were originally summarized in Wang et al.\n11. BERT is a method of pre-training language representations, meaning that we train\na general-purpose \"language understanding\" model on a large text corpus (like\nWikipedia), and then use that model for downstream NLP tasks that we care about\n(like question answering). BERT outperforms previous methods because it is the\nfirst *unsupervised*, *deeply bidirectional* system for pre-training NLP.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nWhat metrics will be used for evaluation in light of tradeoffs between different errors about the model bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking?\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking.
