The model consists of a stack of transformer encoder layers that learn visual representations by predicting visual tokens from corrupted image patches.

It follows the BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers) architecture and training approach. The model is pre-trained on the ImageNet-22K dataset, which contains approximately 14 million images across 22,000 classes.\n\nThe training procedure involves two main stages: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, the model learns visual representations by predicting visual tokens that are masked out from the input image patches. The visual tokens are obtained by discretizing the image patches using a discrete VAE (Variational Autoencoder). This self-supervised learning approach allows the model to capture rich visual features without relying on explicit labels.\n\nAfter pre-training, the model undergoes fine-tuning on downstream tasks using labeled data. The pre-trained weights serve as a strong initialization, enabling the model to adapt quickly to specific visual recognition tasks with limited labeled examples.\n\nThe model uses a patch size of 16x16 and an image resolution of 224x224 pixels.

The pre-training objective is to maximize the log-likelihood of the correct visual tokens z i given the corrupted image:\n7. The network architecture of BEIT follows that of ViT We find that proper initialization is important to stabilize Transformer, especially for large-scale pretraining. We first randomly initialize all the parameters within a small range, such as [\u22120.02, 0.02].\nThen, for the l-th Transformer layer, we rescale the output matrices (i.e., the last linear projection within each sub-layer) of the self-attention module and the feed-forward network by 1 \u221a 2l .\n8. Figure 1 shows the overview of our method. As presented in Section 2.1, given an input image x, we split it into N image patches ({x p i } N i=1 ), and tokenize it to N visual tokens ({z i } N i=1 ). We randomly mask approximately 40% image patches, where the masked positions are denoted as M \u2208 {1, . . . , N } 0.4N . Next we replace the masked patches with a learnable embedding e [M] \u2208 R D . The corrupted image patches x M = {x p i : i / \u2208 M} N i=1 {e [M] : i \u2208 M} N i=1 are then fed into the L-layer\n9. We introduce a self-supervised vision representation model BEIT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers. Following BERT [DCLT19] developed in the natural language processing area, we propose a masked image modeling task to pretrain vision Transformers. Specifically, each image has two views in our pre-training, i.e., image patches (such as 16\u00d716 pixels), and visual tokens (i.e., discrete tokens). We first \"tokenize\" the original image into visual tokens. Then we\n10. Given an input image x, BEIT encodes it to contextualized vector representations. As shown in Figure 1, BEIT is pretrained by the masked image modeling (MIM) task in a self-supervised learning manner. MIM aims at recovering the masked image patches based on encoding vectors. For downstream tasks (such as image classification, and semantic segmentation), we append task layers upon pretrained BEIT and fine-tune the parameters on the specific datasets.\n11. randomly mask some image patches and fed them into the backbone Transformer. The pre-training objective is to recover the original visual tokens based on the corrupted image patches. After pre-training BEIT, we directly fine-tune the model parameters on downstream tasks by appending task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Experimental results on image classification and semantic segmentation show that our model achieves competitive results with previous pre-training methods.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide basic details about the model microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k.

This model has been trained on a large dataset of 22k classes using self-supervised learning techniques, allowing it to learn general visual features that can be applied to different tasks.\n\nTo use the model without fine-tuning, you can employ it as a feature extractor. By passing an image through the pre-trained model, you can obtain a high-level representation of the image in the form of a feature vector. This feature vector captures the essential characteristics of the image and can be used as input for downstream tasks such as image classification, object detection, or image retrieval.\n\nFor example, you can use the extracted features as input to a simple classifier, such as a linear layer or a support vector machine (SVM), to perform image classification on a new dataset without the need to fine-tune the entire model. This approach is particularly useful when you have limited computational resources or a small amount of labeled data for the target task.\n\nBy leveraging the pre-trained weights of the microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k model, you can benefit from its ability to capture meaningful visual features and achieve competitive performance on various computer vision tasks without the need for extensive fine-tuning.", "The microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k model is a pre-trained vision transformer model that can be used for various computer vision tasks without the need for post-processing. This model has been trained on a large dataset of 22k classes, allowing it to learn a wide range of visual features and representations.\n\nTo use this model without post-processing, you can simply pass an input image through the model, and it will output a feature vector or embedding that represents the visual content of the image. This feature vector can then be used directly for tasks such as image classification, similarity search, or clustering, without the need for additional processing steps.\n\nFor example, in an image classification task, you can use the output feature vector as input to a simple linear classifier or a shallow neural network to predict the class label of the image. Since the model has already learned rich visual representations during pre-training, it can often achieve good performance on downstream tasks without requiring complex post-processing techniques.\n\nBy leveraging the power of pre-training on a large dataset, the microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k model provides an efficient and effective way to extract meaningful features from images, enabling its use in various applications without the need for extensive post-processing.", "The microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k model can be used without plugging into a pipeline by directly utilizing the model's architecture and pre-trained weights. This model is a large-scale vision transformer that has been pre-trained on a vast dataset of 22k classes using self-supervised learning techniques.\n\nTo use the model without a pipeline, you would need to:\n\n1. Load the pre-trained model weights into the appropriate model architecture.\n2. Preprocess your input images to match the expected input format of the model (e.g., resizing, normalization).\n3. Pass the preprocessed images through the model to obtain the output features or embeddings.\n4. Utilize the output features for your desired task, such as image classification, retrieval, or clustering.\n\nBy directly working with the model's architecture and weights, you have more flexibility in integrating it into your own custom pipeline or framework. This approach allows you to leverage the model's learned representations and adapt it to your specific use case without being limited by a predefined pipeline.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that using the model without a pipeline requires a deeper understanding of the model's architecture, input/output formats, and the necessary preprocessing steps.

It is pre-trained on the ImageNet-22K dataset using self-supervised learning techniques, specifically the BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers) approach.\n\nTo use this model for image classification tasks, you can leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python. Here's a code snippet demonstrating how to load the model and perform inference:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BeitFeatureExtractor, BeitForImageClassification\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Load the pre-trained model and feature extractor\nmodel = BeitForImageClassification.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k\")\nfeature_extractor = BeitFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k\")\n\n# Load and preprocess the image\nimage = Image.open(\"path/to/your/image.jpg\")\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Perform inference\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlogits = outputs.logits\n\n# Get the predicted class\npredicted_class_idx = logits.argmax(-1).item()\nprint(\"Predicted class index:\", predicted_class_idx)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n\n1. We import the necessary classes from the Transformers library: `BeitFeatureExtractor` for preprocessing the input image and `BeitForImageClassification` for the pre-trained BEiT model.\n\n2. We load the pre-trained model and feature extractor using the `from_pretrained()` method, specifying the model name \"microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k\".\n\n3. We load the image using PIL's `Image.open()` method and preprocess it using the `feature_extractor`. The `return_tensors=\"pt\"` argument ensures that the output is a PyTorch tensor.\n\n4. We perform inference by passing the preprocessed image to the model using the `**inputs` syntax. The model returns the output logits.\n\n5. We obtain the predicted class index by finding the index of the maximum value in the logits tensor using `argmax(-1).item()`.\n\nNote that the model returns the predicted class index based on the ImageNet-22K dataset. To map the index to the corresponding class label, you would need to refer to the dataset's class mapping.\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates the basic usage of the \"microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k\" model for image classification tasks using the Hugging Face Transformers library."]}

We randomly mask some percentage of image patches, and then predict the visual tokens that are corresponding to the masked patches.\n5. max x\u2208D E M i\u2208M log p MIM (z i |x M ) (1)\nwhere D is the training corpus, M represents randomly masked positions, and x M is the corrupted image that is masked according to M.\n6. After pre-training BEIT, we append a task layer upon the Transformer, and fine-tune the parameters on downstream tasks, like BERT. We take image classification and semantic segmentation as examples in our work. It is straightforward to leverage the pre-training-then-fine-tuning paradigm on other vision tasks with BEIT.\n7. Intermediate fine-tuning. After self-supervised pre-training, we can further train BEIT on a datarich intermediate dataset (i.e., ImageNet-1K in our work), and then finetune the model on the target downstream tasks. Such intermediate fine-tuning is the common practice of BERT fine-tuning in NLP [PPL + 20]. We directly follow the method for BEIT.\n8. Semantic segmentation. For semantic segmentation, we follow the task layer used in SETR-PUP [ZLZ + 20]. To be specific, we use pretrained BEIT as a backbone encoder, and incorporate several deconvolution layers as decoder to produce segmentation. The model is also end-to-end fine-tuned similar to image classification.\n9. randomly mask some image patches and fed them into the backbone Transformer. The pre-training objective is to recover the original visual tokens based on the corrupted image patches. After pre-training BEIT, we directly fine-tune the model parameters on downstream tasks by appending task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Experimental results on image classification and semantic segmentation show that our model achieves competitive results with previous pre-training methods.\n10. Given an input image x, BEIT encodes it to contextualized vector representations. As shown in Figure 1, BEIT is pretrained by the masked image modeling (MIM) task in a self-supervised learning manner. MIM aims at recovering the masked image patches based on encoding vectors. For downstream tasks (such as image classification, and semantic segmentation), we append task layers upon pretrained BEIT and fine-tune the parameters on the specific datasets.\n11. auto-encoding pre-training for vision Transformer. Specifically, iGPT uses clustered image tokens as both input and output for image GPT or image BERT. In contrast, we use image patches as input to preserve raw pixels, and employ discrete visual tokens as a prediction bottleneck. ViT-JFT300 predicts the mean, 3-bit color of each masked patch, rather than visual tokens learned by discrete VAE. We also pretrain the self-supervised tasks of BEIT and DINO in a multi-task learning manner, which is presented in\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nExplain how the model microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k can be used without fine-tuning, post-processing, or plugging into a pipeline.

Computational requirements: The BEiT-large model is computationally intensive due to its size and complexity. It requires significant computational resources, such as high-performance GPUs, to train and deploy effectively. This can limit its accessibility and usability for individuals or organizations with limited computational resources.\n\n2. Generalization to new domains: While the BEiT model has been pre-trained on a large dataset (pt22k), its performance on tasks or domains that significantly differ from the pre-training data may be suboptimal. Fine-tuning the model on task-specific data can help mitigate this issue, but it may still struggle with highly specialized or niche domains.\n\n3. Interpretability and transparency: Like many deep learning models, the BEiT model is often considered a \"black box\" due to the complexity of its internal representations and decision-making processes. This lack of interpretability can make it challenging to understand why the model makes certain predictions or to identify and correct biases in its outputs.\n\n4. Potential biases: The BEiT model's performance may be influenced by biases present in the pre-training data. If the pt22k dataset contains biases related to factors such as gender, race, or cultural representation, these biases could be reflected in the model's outputs. Careful evaluation and mitigation strategies may be necessary to address such biases.\n\n5.

For preprocessing the input data, the model follows these tokenization steps:\n\n1. The input image is resized to a fixed size of 224x224 pixels, ensuring consistent dimensions for all images.\n\n2. The resized image is then divided into non-overlapping patches of size 16x16 pixels. This process is known as patch extraction.\n\n3. Each patch is treated as a separate token, and the patches are flattened into a sequence of tokens.\n\n4. The sequence of patch tokens is then prepended with a special classification token, commonly referred to as the [CLS] token. This token is used for tasks such as image classification.\n\n5. Positional embeddings are added to the token sequence to preserve the spatial information of the patches within the image.\n\n6. The resulting token sequence, along with the positional embeddings, is passed through the transformer layers of the model for further processing and feature extraction.\n\nBy dividing the image into patches and treating each patch as a token, the model can efficiently process the visual information while capturing the spatial relationships between different regions of the image.

For preprocessing the input data, the model expects images to be resized to a fixed resolution of 224x224 pixels. This resizing step ensures that all input images have consistent dimensions before being fed into the model.\n\nDuring the resizing process, the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained by default. If the original image has a different aspect ratio than the target size of 224x224, the image is typically resized such that the shorter side matches the target size, and then the longer side is cropped to match the target size as well. This approach helps to preserve the most relevant information in the image while avoiding distortion.\n\nAfter resizing, the pixel values of the image are normalized to a specific range, typically between -1 and 1 or 0 and 1, depending on the requirements of the model. This normalization step helps to ensure that the input data has a consistent scale and distribution, which can improve the model's training stability and performance.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps may vary slightly depending on the implementation and framework being used.

Pre-training is conducted on ImageNet for the comparison purpose, except ViT-JFT300M is pretrained on Google's in-house 300M images.\n3. Scaling up to larger size. We further scale up BEIT to the large size (same as ViT-L). As shown in Table 1, ViT 384 -L is worse than ViT 384 on ImageNet, when training from scratch. The results verifies the data-hungry issue of vision Transformers. Supervised pre-training on ImageNet-22K partially relieves the issue, where ViT 384 -L finally outperforms ViT 384 by 1.2.

The image classification task classifies input images to various categories. We evaluate BEIT on the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset [RDS + 15] with 1k classes and 1.3M images. We directly follow the most of hyperparameters of DeiT [TCD + 20] in our fine-tuning experiments for a fair comparison. We reduce fine-tuning epochs compared with training from scratch, as BEIT has been pre-trained. Accordingly, we use a larger learning rate with layer-wise decay. The detailed hyperparameters are summarized in Appendix\n7. We compare with state-of-the-art supervised pre-training at scale. In addition to using ImageNet-1K for fair comparisons with previous work, we pretrain BEIT on ImageNet-22K to boost performance. We employ the architecture improvements (i.e., LayerScale, and relative position bias) as described in Appendix A, which is denoted as BEIT + in Table 6 and Table 7.

In contrast, we use image patches as input to preserve raw pixels, and employ discrete visual tokens as a prediction bottleneck.

We follow the standard higher-resolution setting of DeiT [TCD + 20], except using fewer epochs. Notice that we keep patch size the same for both 224 \u00d7 224 and 384 \u00d7 384 images.

Performance on other visual domains like medical imaging, satellite imagery, etc. is unclear without further evaluation. [More Information Needed]\n\n- The model uses a patch size of 16x16 and was trained on images of resolution 224x224. Behavior on significantly higher or lower resolution images is unknown. [More Information Needed]\n\nPopulation Subgroups:\n- [More Information Needed] The references do not provide any information on model performance disparities across different population subgroups (e.g. by age, gender, skin tone, etc). Disaggregated evaluation is needed to uncover any such performance differences.\n\n- The pretraining data ImageNet-22K likely contains imbalances and biases present in web-scraped image data. Without further analysis, it's unknown if the model inherits and amplifies these biases.\n\nOther Factors:\n- As a large 307M parameter model, BEIT-L requires significant compute resources to use, which could limit accessibility. Smaller variants exist but with lower performance.\n\n- The blockwise masking pretraining appears beneficial for downstream tasks like segmentation. However, predicting mean patch colors performs worse than using a visual token bottleneck.\n\nIn summary, more targeted evaluation is needed to characterize BEIT's performance across diverse domains and populations. Potential issues around bias, fairness, and compute requirements are important to analyze further before real-world deployment."}

{"question": "testing_metrics", "chain": "rev_retrieval", "prompt": ["Based on the information provided in the model name \"microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k\", it is not possible to determine the specific metrics used for evaluating the model's performance. The name suggests that it is a large version of the BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers) model, which uses a patch size of 16x16 and an input image resolution of 224x224 pixels. The \"pt22k\" likely refers to pre-training on the ImageNet-22k dataset.\n\nHowever, the choice of evaluation metrics depends on the specific task the model is being used for, such as image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation. Common metrics for these tasks include:\n\n1. Image Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Top-k accuracy.\n2. Object Detection: Mean Average Precision (mAP), Intersection over Union (IoU), and Recall.\n3. Semantic Segmentation: Pixel Accuracy, Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and Frequency Weighted Intersection over Union (FWIoU).\n\nTo determine the exact metrics used for evaluating the \"microsoft/beit-large-patch16-224-pt22k\" model, one would need to refer to the original research paper or documentation provided by the model developers.", "When considering the tradeoffs between different errors about the Microsoft BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers) large model, it's important to understand the model's architecture and training process. The BEiT model is pre-trained on a large dataset of 22K image-text pairs, which allows it to learn rich visual representations. However, this pre-training process can introduce certain biases and errors.\n\nOne potential tradeoff is between the model's ability to generalize well to new tasks and its tendency to overfit to the pre-training data. If the model is too heavily optimized for the pre-training task, it may struggle to adapt to new tasks or domains, leading to decreased performance. On the other hand, if the model is not sufficiently pre-trained, it may lack the necessary visual understanding to perform well on downstream tasks.\n\nAnother tradeoff to consider is the balance between the model's accuracy and its computational efficiency. The BEiT model is a large, complex model with many parameters, which can make it computationally expensive to train and deploy. While this allows the model to capture fine-grained details and achieve high accuracy, it may not be feasible for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications.\n\nAdditionally, there is a tradeoff between the model's robustness to adversarial examples and its overall performance. Adversarial examples are carefully crafted inputs designed to fool the model into making incorrect predictions. While techniques exist to improve a model's robustness to such examples, they often come at the cost of reduced accuracy on clean, non-adversarial data.\n\nIn summary, the main tradeoffs to consider when evaluating the Microsoft BEiT large model include generalization vs. overfitting, accuracy vs. computational efficiency, and robustness vs. overall performance. The optimal balance between these factors will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the downstream task and deployment environment."], "answer": ["- July 2021: BEiT-large achieves **state-of-the-art ImageNet top-1 accuracy (88.6%) under the setting without extra data other than ImageNet-22k**.\n- July 2021: release [the code and pretrained models of **BEiT**](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/beit)\n- June 2021: release preprint [BEiT: BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08254)", "We provide four BEiT weights pretrained on ImageNet-22k.

Training from scratch (i.e., random initialization)  1: Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. We evaluate base-(\"-B\") and large-size (\"-L\") models at resolutions 224 \u00d7 224 and 384 \u00d7 384. \u2020 : iGPT-1.36B contains 1.36 billion parameters, while others are base-size models. \u2021 : ViT 384 -B-JFT300M is pretrained with the \"masked patch prediction\" task on Google's in-house 300M images, while others use ImageNet.\n2. The image classification task classifies input images to various categories. We evaluate BEIT on the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset [RDS + 15] with 1k classes and 1.3M images. We directly follow the most of hyperparameters of DeiT [TCD + 20] in our fine-tuning experiments for a fair comparison. We reduce fine-tuning epochs compared with training from scratch, as BEIT has been pre-trained. Accordingly, we use a larger learning rate with layer-wise decay. The detailed hyperparameters are summarized in Appendix\n3. Table 1 reports top-1 accuracy on image classification. We compare BEIT with vision Transformers trained by random initialization, supervised pre-training, and previous self-supervised learning methods. All the compared models are base-size, except iGPT has 1.36B parameters. Pre-training is conducted on ImageNet for the comparison purpose, except ViT-JFT300M is pretrained on Google's in-house 300M images.\n4. BEIT from base to large are greater than supervised pre-training with ImageNet-22K. More importantly, comparing between BEIT 384 with ViT 384 that conducts supervised pre-training on ImageNet-22K, the improvements of BEIT become greater along with scaling the size from base (i.e., 0.6) to large (i.e., 1.1). The results suggest that BEIT tends to help more for extremely larger models (such as 1B, or 10B), especially when labeled data are insufficient 3 to conduct supervised pre-training 4 for such large\n5. Scaling up to larger size. We further scale up BEIT to the large size (same as ViT-L). As shown in Table 1, ViT 384 -L is worse than ViT 384 on ImageNet, when training from scratch. The results verifies the data-hungry issue of vision Transformers. Supervised pre-training on ImageNet-22K partially relieves the issue, where ViT 384 -L finally outperforms ViT 384 by 1.2. In comparison, BEIT-L is better than BEIT by 2.0, and BEIT 384 -L outperforms BEIT 384 by 1.7. In other words, the benefits of scaling up\n6. We conduct ablation studies to analyze the contributions of each component in BEIT. The models are evaluated on image classification (i.e., ImageNet) and semantic segmentation (i.e., ADE20K). We set the default pre-training steps to 300 epochs for the ablation studies, which is 37.5% of the total steps used in the previous experiments.\n7. As shown in Figure 2, we plot the self-attention map for different reference points within an image. The visualizations are produced by attention scores computed via query-key product in the last layer. For each reference point, we use the corresponding patch as query, and show which patch it attends to. After pre-training, BEIT learns to distinguish semantic regions using self-attention heads, without any task-specific supervision. The property partially indicates the reason why BEIT is able to help\n8. Table 4 reports the results of various model variants. First, we ablate blockwise masking by randomly sample masked positions. We find that blockwise masking is beneficial on both tasks, especially on semantic segmentation. Second, we ablate the usage of visual tokens by predicting the raw pixels of masked patches, i.e., the pre-training task becomes a pixel regression problem to recover masked patches. Our proposed masked image modeling task significantly outperforms naive pixel-level auto-encoding.\n9. - July 2021: BEiT-large achieves **state-of-the-art ImageNet top-1 accuracy (88.6%) under the setting without extra data other than ImageNet-22k**.\n- July 2021: release [the code and pretrained models of **BEiT**](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/beit)\n- June 2021: release preprint [BEiT: BERT Pre-Training of Image Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08254)\n10.

By visualizing the self-attention map for different reference points within an image, it is observed that after pre-training, BEIT learns to distinguish semantic regions using self-attention heads [1]. This property partially indicates why BEIT is able to help with downstream tasks, as the knowledge acquired during pre-training potentially improves the generalization ability of fine-tuned models [1, 4].\n\nThe code for analyzing the self-attention map is grouped in the BEiTv2 Repo [3]:\n[More Information Needed]\n\nFurther experiments show that BEIT's performance improvements from base to large models are greater than supervised pre-training with ImageNet-22K [6]. This suggests that BEIT tends to help more for extremely larger models, especially when labeled data are insufficient for supervised pre-training [6].\n\nAblation studies demonstrate that blockwise masking is beneficial for BEIT, particularly on semantic segmentation tasks [7]. Additionally, the proposed masked image modeling task significantly outperforms naive pixel-level auto-encoding [7, 8]."}

As shown in Figure 1, BEIT is pretrained by the masked image modeling (MIM) task in a self-supervised learning manner. MIM aims at recovering the masked image patches based on encoding vectors. For downstream tasks (such as image classification, and semantic segmentation), we append task layers upon pretrained BEIT and fine-tune the parameters on the specific datasets.\n11. The MIM task is greatly inspired by masked language modeling [DCLT19], which is one of the most successful pre-training objective in natural language processing. Moreover, blockwise (or n-gram) masking is also widely applied in BERT-like models [JCL + 20, BDW + 20, RSR + 20]. However, directly using pixel-level auto-encoding (i.e., recovering the pixels of masked patches) for vision pretraining pushes the model to focus on short-range dependencies and high-frequency details [RPG + 21].
