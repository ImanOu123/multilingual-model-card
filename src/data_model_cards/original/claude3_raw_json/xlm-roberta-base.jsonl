We use an internal language identification model in combination with the one from fastText (Joulin et al., 2017). We train language models in each language and use it to filter documents as described in Wenzek et al. (2019). We consider one CommonCrawl dump for English and twelve dumps for all other languages, which significantly increases dataset sizes, especially for\n4. (recall from Section 3 that we used a fixed vocabulary size of 150K for all models).   vocabulary, and the rate at which we sample training examples from each language. We study the effect of sampling on the performance of highresource (English and French) and low-resource (Swahili and Urdu) languages for an XLM-100 model trained on Wikipedia (we observe a similar trend for the construction of the subword vocab). Specifically, we investigate the impact of varying the \u03b1 parameter which controls the\n5. enization directly on raw text data using Sentence Piece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018) with a unigram language model (Kudo, 2018). We sample batches from different languages using the same sampling distribution as Lample and Conneau (2019), but with \u03b1 = 0.3. Unlike Lample and Conneau (2019), we do not use language embeddings, which allows our model to better deal with code-switching. We use a large vocabulary size of 250K with a full softmax and train two different models: XLM-R Base (L = 12, H = 768, A =\n6. In this section, we present the training objective, languages, and data we use. We follow the XLM approach (Lample and Conneau, 2019) as closely as possible, only introducing changes that improve performance at scale. Masked Language Models. We use a Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) trained with the multilingual MLM objective (Devlin et al., 2018;Lample and Conneau, 2019) using only monolingual data. We sample streams of text from each language and train the model to predict the masked tokens in the\n7. The goal of this paper is to improve cross-lingual language understanding (XLU), by carefully studying the effects of training unsupervised crosslingual representations at a very large scale. We present XLM-R a transformer-based multilingual masked language model pre-trained on text in 100 languages, which obtains state-of-the-art performance on cross-lingual classification, sequence labeling and question answering.\n8. performance of monolingual models (BERT) versus multilingual models (XLM) on seven languages, using a BERT-BASE architecture. We choose a vocabulary size of 40k and 150k for monolingual and multilingual models.\n9. study to assess this claim on the XNLI benchmark. We extend our comparison between multilingual XLM models and monolingual BERT models on 7 languages and compare performance in Table 5. We train 14 monolingual BERT models on Wikipedia and CommonCrawl (capped at 60 GiB), and two XLM-7 models. We increase the vocabulary size of the multilingual model for a better comparison. We found that multilingual models can outperform their monolingual BERT counterparts. Specifically, in   -BASE). We compare the\n10. On the other hand, pretraining on CC improved performance by up to 10 points. This confirms our assumption that mBERT and XLM-100 rely heavily on cross-lingual transfer but do not model the low-resource languages as well as XLM-R. Specifically, in the translate-train-all setting, we observe that the biggest gains for XLM models trained on CC, compared to their Wikipedia counterparts, are on low-resource languages; 7% and 4.8% improvement on Swahili and Urdu respectively.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nSummarize the type of the model xlm-roberta-base in terms of the training method, machine learning type, and modality in one sentence.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model xlm-roberta-base.

Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to load the model and perform text classification:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification\n\n# Load the XLM-RoBERTa base model and tokenizer\nmodel_name = \"xlm-roberta-base\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\n# Example text in multiple languages\ntexts = [\n    \"This is an example sentence in English.\",\n    \"Ceci est un exemple de phrase en fran\u00e7ais.\",\n    \"Dies ist ein Beispielsatz in Deutsch.\",\n]\n\n# Tokenize the texts\nencoded_inputs = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Perform text classification\noutputs = model(**encoded_inputs)\npredicted_labels = outputs.logits.argmax(dim=1)\n\n# Print the predicted labels\nfor text, label in zip(texts, predicted_labels):\n    print(f\"Text: {text}\")\n    print(f\"Predicted Label: {label}\")\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, we first load the XLM-RoBERTa base model and its associated tokenizer using the `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` classes from the Transformers library.\n\nNext, we define a list of example texts in multiple languages. We tokenize these texts using the loaded tokenizer, specifying padding and truncation options to ensure consistent input lengths.\n\nFinally, we pass the encoded inputs to the model to perform text classification. The model returns the logits, which represent the predicted probabilities for each label. We take the argmax of the logits to obtain the predicted labels.\n\nThe code snippet demonstrates how to use the XLM-RoBERTa base model for multilingual text classification.

When fine-tuned for a specific task, this model can be utilized for various natural language processing (NLP) applications across multiple languages.\n\nTo fine-tune the XLM-RoBERTa-base model for a specific task, the model's architecture is modified by adding task-specific layers on top of the pretrained model. The entire model is then trained on a labeled dataset relevant to the target task, allowing the model to adapt its knowledge to the specific requirements of the task at hand.\n\nFor example, if the task is sentiment analysis in multiple languages, a classification layer is added on top of the XLM-RoBERTa-base model. The model is then fine-tuned using a labeled dataset containing text in various languages, along with their corresponding sentiment labels (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral). During fine-tuning, the model learns to associate patterns in the input text with the appropriate sentiment labels, enabling it to predict the sentiment of new, unseen text in the languages it was trained on.\n\nThe fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-base model can be applied to a wide range of NLP tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, and more, across multiple languages.

This allows for efficient routing of tickets to the appropriate support team, reducing response times and improving customer satisfaction.\n\nMoreover, the model's ability to perform sentiment analysis can be leveraged in social media monitoring applications to gauge public opinion about a brand, product, or service across different languages and regions.

More research would be needed on xlm-roberta-base specifically to characterize actual demonstrated harms. Responsible development and deployment with appropriate safeguards can also help mitigate potential negative impacts. Overall, the benefits of multilingual models for improving language technology also need to be weighed against risks and harms.", "The XLM-RoBERTa-base model, while powerful and versatile in its multilingual capabilities, may have some potential misunderstandings or limitations:\n\n1. Language bias: Although the model is trained on a diverse set of languages, it may still exhibit biases towards certain languages or language families that are more prominently represented in the training data. This could lead to better performance on some languages compared to others.\n\n2. Cultural and contextual understanding: The model may struggle with understanding subtle cultural nuances, idioms, or context-specific expressions in different languages. This could result in misinterpretations or less accurate responses when dealing with such language elements.\n\n3. Domain-specific knowledge: XLM-RoBERTa-base is a general-purpose language model and may not have in-depth knowledge of specific domains or technical jargon. When applied to specialized fields, it may require additional fine-tuning or domain adaptation to achieve optimal performance.\n\n4. Ambiguity and multiple meanings: In some cases, the model may struggle to disambiguate words or phrases that have multiple meanings or interpretations across different languages. This could lead to misunderstandings or incorrect translations in certain contexts.\n\n5. Lack of common sense reasoning: Like many language models, XLM-RoBERTa-base may sometimes generate responses that lack common sense or real-world understanding. It relies on patterns and statistical associations learned from the training data, which may not always align with human intuition or real-world knowledge.\n\nIt's important to keep these potential limitations in mind when using the XLM-RoBERTa-base model and to carefully evaluate its outputs, especially in critical or sensitive applications.

Limited context length: Like most transformer-based models, XLM-RoBERTa-base has a maximum input sequence length, typically around 512 tokens. This limits the model's ability to process and understand longer texts or documents.\n\n2. Language-specific performance: Although XLM-RoBERTa-base is a multilingual model trained on 100 languages, its performance may vary across different languages. The model might perform better on languages with more training data or those more similar to the languages it was primarily trained on.\n\n3. Domain-specific knowledge: The model's knowledge is based on its training data, which is primarily sourced from web crawl data. It may lack domain-specific knowledge or struggle with understanding highly specialized or technical language in certain fields.\n\n4. Bias and fairness: XLM-RoBERTa-base, like other language models, can potentially reflect and amplify biases present in its training data. This can lead to biased or unfair outputs, particularly when dealing with sensitive topics or underrepresented groups.\n\n5. Lack of common sense reasoning: While the model can generate fluent and contextually relevant text, it may struggle with tasks that require common sense reasoning or understanding of real-world knowledge not explicitly present in its training data.\n\n6. Computational resources: XLM-RoBERTa-base is a large model with 270 million parameters, requiring significant computational resources for fine-tuning and inference. This can limit its usability in resource-constrained environments or real-time applications.\n\nAs with all language models, it's essential to consider these limitations when applying XLM-RoBERTa-base to specific tasks and to use appropriate evaluation metrics and human oversight to ensure the model's outputs align with the intended use case.", "The XLM-RoBERTa-base model, while powerful, has several known and potential sociotechnical limitations:\n\n1.

Lack of deep understanding: The model operates based on statistical patterns and associations rather than true language understanding, which can result in nonsensical or inconsistent outputs, especially for complex or nuanced prompts.\n\n3. Limited context: XLM-RoBERTa-base has a fixed input size limit, restricting its ability to process and generate longer sequences or maintain coherence across extended contexts.\n\n4. Multilingual trade-offs: While the model is trained on many languages, its performance may not be equal across all of them, with lower-resource languages potentially having reduced quality.\n\n5. Misuse potential: The model's ability to generate fluent text could be misused for disinformation, spam, or other malicious purposes if not properly controlled.\n\n6.

{"question": "bias_recommendations", "chain": "rev_retrieval", "prompt": ["When considering the XLM-RoBERTa-base model, there are a few foreseeable issues that users should be aware of:\n\n1. Limited context understanding: Like most transformer-based models, XLM-RoBERTa-base has a limited context window, which means it may struggle with understanding long-range dependencies or maintaining coherence in longer texts.\n\n2. Bias and fairness concerns: The model is trained on a large corpus of multilingual data, which may contain biases present in the training data. This can lead to the model exhibiting biased behavior or generating outputs that reflect these biases.\n\n3. Lack of domain-specific knowledge: While XLM-RoBERTa-base is a powerful general-purpose language model, it may not have the domain-specific knowledge required for certain specialized tasks or industries.\n\n4. Resource requirements: The model has a significant number of parameters, which means it requires substantial computational resources to train and deploy. This can be a challenge for users with limited access to high-performance computing infrastructure.\n\n5. Multilingual performance: Although XLM-RoBERTa-base is designed to handle multiple languages, its performance may vary across different languages, especially those with limited representation in the training data.\n\nAddressing these issues may require fine-tuning the model on domain-specific data, applying bias mitigation techniques, and carefully evaluating the model's performance across different languages and tasks.", "When considering the use of the XLM-RoBERTa-base model, there are a few foreseeable issues and recommendations to keep in mind:\n\n1. Computational resources: The XLM-RoBERTa-base model is a large model with 270 million parameters. Running this model requires significant computational resources, such as GPU memory and processing power. Ensure that your hardware setup is capable of handling the model's requirements for training and inference.\n\n2. Language-specific performance: Although XLM-RoBERTa-base is a multilingual model trained on 100 languages, its performance may vary across different languages. The model's performance on a specific language depends on factors such as the amount and quality of training data available for that language. It is recommended to evaluate the model's performance on your target language(s) before deploying it in production.\n\n3. Domain adaptation: The XLM-RoBERTa-base model is pre-trained on a large corpus of general-domain text. If your target task involves a specific domain (e.g., legal, medical, or technical), the model may require fine-tuning on domain-specific data to achieve optimal performance. Consider collecting and annotating domain-specific data for fine-tuning the model.\n\n4. Model bias: Like any machine learning model, XLM-RoBERTa-base may inherit biases present in its training data. These biases can lead to unfair or discriminatory outputs when applied to certain demographics or contexts. It is recommended to carefully evaluate the model's outputs for potential biases and take steps to mitigate them, such as using debiasing techniques or post-processing the model's predictions.\n\n5. Model updates and maintenance: As new research and improvements emerge in the field of natural language processing, the XLM-RoBERTa-base model may become outdated over time. Keep an eye on updates and new releases from the model's developers (Facebook AI) and consider updating your model periodically to benefit from the latest advancements and bug fixes.\n\nBy considering these recommendations and addressing the foreseeable issues, you can effectively leverage the XLM-RoBERTa-base model for your multilingual natural language processing tasks while ensuring optimal performance and fairness."], "answer": ["GLUE: XLM-R versus RoBERTa.

XLM-R is trained on 100 languages; we provide a full list of languages and associated statistics in Appendix A. Figure 1 specifies the iso codes of 88 languages that are shared across XLM-R and XLM-100, the model from Lample and Conneau (2019) trained on Wikipedia text in 100 languages. Compared to previous work, we replace some languages with more commonly used ones such as romanized Hindi and traditional Chinese. In our ablation studies, we always include the 7 languages\n4. In this section, we present the training objective, languages, and data we use. We follow the XLM approach (Lample and Conneau, 2019) as closely as possible, only introducing changes that improve performance at scale. Masked Language Models. We use a Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) trained with the multilingual MLM objective (Devlin et al., 2018;Lample and Conneau, 2019) using only monolingual data.

Unlike Lample and Conneau (2019), we do not use language embeddings, which allows our model to better deal with code-switching.

In this work, we introduced XLM-R, our new state of the art multilingual masked language model trained on 2.5 TB of newly created clean Com-monCrawl data in 100 languages. We show that it provides strong gains over previous multilingual models like mBERT and XLM on classification, sequence labeling and question answering.

Scaling to a hundred languages. XLM-R is trained on 100 languages; we provide a full list of languages and associated statistics in Appendix A. Figure 1 specifies the iso codes of 88 languages that are shared across XLM-R and XLM-100, the model from Lample and Conneau (2019) trained on Wikipedia text in 100 languages.

In this section, we present the training objective, languages, and data we use. We follow the XLM approach (Lample and Conneau, 2019) as closely as possible, only introducing changes that improve performance at scale. Masked Language Models. We use a Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) trained with the multilingual MLM objective (Devlin et al., 2018;Lample and Conneau, 2019) using only monolingual data.

Unlike Lample and Conneau (2019), we do not use language embeddings, which allows our model to better deal with code-switching. We use a large vocabulary size of 250K with a full softmax and train two different models: XLM-R Base (L = 12, H = 768, A =\n4. Scaling the Amount of Training Data. Following Wenzek et al.

We train language models in each language and use it to filter documents as described in Wenzek et al. (2019).

We study the effect of sampling on the performance of highresource (English and French) and low-resource (Swahili and Urdu) languages for an XLM-100 model trained on Wikipedia (we observe a similar trend for the construction of the subword vocab). Specifically, we investigate the impact of varying the \u03b1 parameter which controls the\n9. On the other hand, pretraining on CC improved performance by up to 10 points. This confirms our assumption that mBERT and XLM-100 rely heavily on cross-lingual transfer but do not model the low-resource languages as well as XLM-R.
