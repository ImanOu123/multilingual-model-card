It scraps multilingual PDF documents of 53 languages from a web crawler and introduces extra pre-processing steps to clean the collected data, filter the low-quality documents, and classify them into different languages. After this, it utilizes a heuristic distribution to sample 22 million multilingual documents, which are further combined with the 8 million sampled English ones from the IIT-CDIP\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nSummarize what natural human language the model SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base uses or processes in one sentence.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base.

The SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model has been trained on a large corpus of English text, allowing it to understand the intricacies of the language and capture contextual information.\n\nTo use the model without fine-tuning, you can directly feed it input text and utilize its output embeddings or representations for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or semantic similarity. The model's understanding of language patterns and relationships enables it to generate meaningful representations that can be used as features for downstream tasks.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while using the model without fine-tuning can provide decent results, fine-tuning the model on a specific task with labeled data often leads to better performance. Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt its knowledge to the specific nuances and requirements of the target task.", "The SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model is a pre-trained language model based on the RoBERTa architecture, which has been fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks.

The model has been trained to understand and process natural language, allowing it to generate meaningful representations of the input text. These representations can be used for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or as features for downstream applications.\n\nBy leveraging the pre-trained weights and the fine-tuning process, the SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model captures rich linguistic information and can produce high-quality results without requiring complex post-processing steps. This makes it convenient and efficient to integrate the model into various natural language processing pipelines or applications.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the model can be used without post-processing, depending on the specific task and requirements, some minimal post-processing steps may still be necessary.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Load the tokenizer:\n   - Import the AutoTokenizer class from the transformers library.\n   - Use the `from_pretrained()` method to load the tokenizer specific to the SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model.\n\n2. Tokenize the input:\n   - Pass the input text to the tokenizer's `encode()` method to convert it into a sequence of token IDs.\n   - Apply any necessary preprocessing steps, such as padding or truncation, to ensure the input matches the model's expected format.\n\n3. Load the pre-trained model:\n   - Import the AutoModel class from the transformers library.\n   - Use the `from_pretrained()` method to load the pre-trained weights of the SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model.\n\n4. Forward pass:\n   - Create an input tensor by converting the tokenized input into a PyTorch tensor.\n   - Pass the input tensor through the loaded model to perform a forward pass.\n   - Obtain the model's output, which will be a tensor containing the hidden states or pooled output, depending on the model's architecture.\n\n5. Process the output:\n   - Depending on the task at hand (e.g., text classification, sequence labeling), you may need to further process the model's output.\n   - This could involve applying a classification head, decoding the output, or extracting specific information from the hidden states.\n\nBy following these steps, you can utilize the SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model directly without relying on a pre-built pipeline. This approach provides more flexibility and control over the model's usage, allowing you to customize the input processing, output handling, and integrate the model into your own workflow.", "The SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model is a RoBERTa-based language model that has been fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks.

We specify the model name \"SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base\" to load the pre-trained weights.\n\nNext, we provide an example text that we want to classify. We tokenize the text using the loaded tokenizer, which converts the text into a format that the model can understand.\n\nWe then pass the tokenized inputs to the model using the `**inputs` syntax, which unpacks the inputs dictionary into keyword arguments. The model returns the output logits, which represent the predicted class probabilities.\n\nFinally, we use `argmax()` to find the index of the highest probability class and print the predicted class.\n\nThis is just a simple example, but the SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model can be used for various other tasks such as text generation, question answering, and more, by using the appropriate model class and adjusting the code accordingly."]}

It has been trained on a large corpus of English text data, allowing it to understand and generate human-like text. When fine-tuned for a specific task, this model can be adapted to excel in various natural language processing (NLP) applications.\n\nTo use the SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model for a specific task, you would first need to fine-tune it using a labeled dataset relevant to your desired application. For example, if you want to use the model for sentiment analysis, you would fine-tune it using a dataset containing text examples labeled with their corresponding sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral). During the fine-tuning process, the model learns to associate patterns in the input text with the corresponding labels, adapting its knowledge to the specific task.\n\nOnce fine-tuned, the SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model can be used for inference on new, unseen text data. It will process the input text and generate predictions based on the patterns it learned during the fine-tuning process. The fine-tuned model can be applied to various NLP tasks, such as:\n\n1. Text classification: Categorizing text into predefined classes, such as sentiment analysis, topic classification, or spam detection.\n\n2. Named entity recognition: Identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) in text.\n\n3. Question answering: Providing answers to questions based on a given context or knowledge base.\n\n4. Text summarization: Generating concise summaries of longer text passages while preserving the key information.\n\nThe performance of the fine-tuned SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model will depend on the quality and quantity of the labeled data used for fine-tuning, as well as the complexity of the specific task. However, the pre-trained nature of the model provides a strong foundation for achieving high accuracy on a wide range of NLP tasks with relatively little labeled data compared to training a model from scratch.", "The SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model, which is a RoBERTa-based language model, can be seamlessly integrated into a larger ecosystem or application to enhance various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. When plugged into a broader system, this model can be utilized for several purposes:\n\n1. Text Classification: The model can be fine-tuned to classify text into predefined categories, such as sentiment analysis, topic classification, or intent recognition. This functionality can be incorporated into customer support systems, social media monitoring tools, or content recommendation engines.\n\n2. Named Entity Recognition (NER): By fine-tuning the model for NER, it can identify and extract named entities like person names, organizations, locations, or dates from unstructured text. This capability can be integrated into information extraction pipelines, document processing systems, or knowledge graph construction.\n\n3. Question Answering: The model can be adapted to answer questions based on a given context or knowledge base. This feature can be incorporated into chatbots, virtual assistants, or search engines to provide users with accurate and relevant information.\n\n4. Text Summarization: Fine-tuning the model for text summarization enables it to generate concise summaries of longer texts. This functionality can be integrated into content management systems, news aggregators, or research tools to help users quickly grasp the key points of articles or documents.\n\n5. Language Translation: Although the SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model is primarily designed for English, it can be used as a base model for developing machine translation systems. By fine-tuning the model with parallel corpora, it can be adapted to translate text between English and other languages, which can be incorporated into translation services or multilingual applications.\n\nBy leveraging the power of the SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model within a larger ecosystem or application, developers can enhance the NLP capabilities of their systems, providing users with more accurate, efficient, and user-friendly experiences when interacting with text-based data.", "I apologize, but I don't have enough context to provide a specific answer or code snippet related to the model SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base.

Experimental results on eight languages under three settings (language-specific, cross-lingual zero-shot transfer, and multi-task fine-tuning) have fully illustrated its\n4. In contrast, BiACM can maintain LiLT's cross-model cooperation ability on the basis of providing cross-modal information. Moreover, the necessity of DETACH in pre-training is proved in (a)#4 vs (a)#3. Compared (a)#3 to (a)#5, we can also infer that removing DETACH in fine-tuning leads to a better performance.\n5. Considering the complete pre-training takes a long time, we pre-train LiLT BASE with 2M documents randomly sampled from IIT-CDIP for 5 epochs to conduct ablation experiments, as shown in Table 1.\n6.

However, it required a heavy process of multilingual data collection, cleaning and pre-training. On the contrary, our LiLT can deal with the multilingual structured documents by pre-training on the monolingual IIT-CDIP Test Collection 1.0 (Lewis et al., 2006) only.\n8. This task is originally derived from (Devlin et al., 2019). MVLM randomly masks some of the input tokens and the model is asked to recover them over the whole vocabulary using the output encoded features, driven by a cross-entropy loss. Meanwhile, the non-textual information remains unchanged. MVLM improves model learning on the language side with cross-modality information. The given layout embedding can also help the model better capture both inter-and intra-sentence relationships. We mask 15% text\n9.

However, this process is timeconsuming and laborious. On the contrary, LiLT can be pre-trained with only IIT-CDIP and then adapted to other languages. In this respect, LiLT is the first language-independent method for structured document understanding.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nWhat are the known or foreseeable issues stemming from this model SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base?

If applied to documents in other languages or domains without proper fine-tuning, the model may produce inaccurate or biased results. More testing is needed to understand cross-lingual and cross-domain generalization.\n- [More Information Needed] on potential misuse cases or harms from applying the model to sensitive documents.\n\nTechnical limitations: \n- The complete pre-training process is very time-consuming. The ablation experiments only used a subset of data (2M documents for 5 epochs). Full pre-training likely requires significant compute resources.\n- [More Information Needed] on model performance metrics, failure modes, and areas for improvement.\n\nSociotechnical considerations:\n- Deploying the model for real-world applications would require carefully curating multilingual training data. Reference 7 notes this is a \"heavy process\". Responsible data sourcing, cleaning and governance is important.\n- As an early research project, the model needs further development and empirical validation before use in high-stakes scenarios.

The tokenizer also adds special tokens, such as [CLS] and [SEP], to the input sequence to indicate the beginning and end of the text.\n\nEncoding:\nAfter tokenization, the subword units are converted into numerical representations called input IDs. Each subword unit is assigned a unique integer ID based on the RoBERTa vocabulary. Additionally, attention masks are created to indicate which tokens should be attended to by the model during the self-attention mechanism. The attention mask has a value of 1 for tokens that should be attended to and 0 for padding tokens.\n\nThe maximum sequence length for the SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base model is typically set to 512 tokens.

The tokenization process for this model can be described as follows:\n\n1. The input text is first normalized by converting it to lowercase and removing any accent markers.\n\n2. The normalized text is then tokenized using a byte-level Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm. This algorithm iteratively replaces the most frequent pair of bytes in the text with a single, unused byte, effectively creating a vocabulary of subword units.\n\n3. The BPE tokenization is applied to the input text, splitting it into a sequence of subword tokens. This allows the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subword units.\n\n4. Special tokens, such as [CLS] (classification token) and [SEP] (separator token), are added to the sequence of subword tokens as needed, depending on the specific task and input format.\n\n5. The subword tokens are then converted into their corresponding token IDs based on the model's pre-defined vocabulary.\n\n6. The token IDs are used as input to the RoBERTa model, which processes them through its deep bidirectional Transformer architecture to generate contextualized representations of the input text.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific details of the tokenization process may vary slightly depending on the implementation and any modifications made to the original RoBERTa tokenization pipeline by the SCUT-DLVCLab team.

However, almost all of them only focus on pre-training and fine-tuning on the documents in a single language, typically English. This is extremely limited for other languages, especially in the case of lacking pre-training structured document data.\n4. Experimental results on eight languages have shown that LiLT can achieve competitive or even superior performance on diverse widely-used downstream benchmarks, which substantially benefits numerous real-world SDU applications. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We introduce a simple yet effective languageindependent layout Transformer called LiLT for monolingual/multilingual structured document understanding.\n5. To the best of our knowledge, the only preexisting multilingual SDU model is LayoutXLM (Xu et al., 2021b). It scraps multilingual PDF documents of 53 languages from a web crawler and introduces extra pre-processing steps to clean the collected data, filter the low-quality documents, and classify them into different languages. After this, it utilizes a heuristic distribution to sample 22 million multilingual documents, which are further combined with the 8 million sampled English ones from the IIT-CDIP\n6.

To demonstrate the performance of LiLT, we conduct experiments on several widely-used monolingual datasets and the multilingual XFUND benchmark (Xu et al., 2021b). In addition to the experiments involving typical language-specific finetuning, we also follow the two settings designed   (Dauphinee et al., 2019).\n3. (3) Multitask fine-tuning requires the model to fine-tune on data in all languages.\n4. ```\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 examples/run_funsd.py \\\n        --model_name_or_path lilt-roberta-en-base \\\n        --tokenizer_name roberta-base \\\n        --output_dir ser_funsd_lilt-roberta-en-base \\\n        --do_train \\\n        --do_predict \\\n        --max_steps 2000 \\\n        --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \\\n        --warmup_ratio 0.1 \\\n        --fp16\n```\n5. <img src=\"./figs/ls_xfund.png\" alt=\"ls_xfund\"/>\n6. In contrast, BiACM can maintain LiLT's cross-model cooperation ability on the basis of providing cross-modal information. Moreover, the necessity of DETACH in pre-training is proved in (a)#4 vs (a)#3. Compared (a)#3 to (a)#5, we can also infer that removing DETACH in fine-tuning leads to a better performance.\n7. replace BiACM with the co-attention mechanism (Lu et al., 2019) which is widely adopted in dualstream Transformer architecture. It can be seen as a \"deeper\" cross-modal interaction, since the keys and values from each modality are passed as input to the other modality's dot-product attention calculation. However, severe drops are observed as shown in (a)#2 vs (a)#1#3. We attribute it to the damage of such a \"deeper\" interaction to the overall consistency of the text flow in the pre-training optimization.\n8. Considering the complete pre-training takes a long time, we pre-train LiLT BASE with 2M documents randomly sampled from IIT-CDIP for 5 epochs to conduct ablation experiments, as shown in Table 1.\n9. Then we evaluate LiLT on language-specific fine-tuning tasks of FUNSD and the multilingual XFUND (Xu et al., 2021b), and the results are shown in Table 6. Compared with the plain text models (XLM-R/InfoXLM) or the LayoutXLM model pre-trained with 30M multilingual structured documents, LiLT achieves the highest F1 scores on both the SER and RE tasks of each language while using 11M monolingual data. This significant improvement shows LiLT's capability to transfer language-independent knowledge from\n10. We first evaluate LiLT on four widely-used monolingual datasets -FUNSD (Jaume et al., 2019), CORD (Park et al., 2019), EPHOIE  and RVL-CDIP (Lewis et al., 2006), and the results are shown in Table 2, 3, 4 and 5. We have found that (1) LiLT is flexible since it can work with monolingual or multilingual plain text models to deal with downstream tasks. (2) Although LiLT is designed for the transfer from \"monolingual\" to \"multilingual\", it can surprisingly cooperate with monolingual textual models to achieve\n11. Table 8 shows the results of multitask learning. In this setting, the pre-trained LiLT model is simultaneously fine-tuned with all eight languages and evaluated for each specific language. We observe that this setting further improves the model performance compared to the language-specific finetuning, which confirms that SDU can benefit from commonalities in the layout of multilingual structured documents. In addition, LiLT once again outperforms its counterparts by a large margin.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nWhat metrics will be used for evaluation in light of tradeoffs between different errors about the model SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base?\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base.

LiLT BASE is pre-trained using Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015;Loshchilov and Hutter, 2018), with the learning rate 2\u00d710 \u22125 , weight decay 1\u00d710 \u22122 , and (\u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 ) = (0.9, 0.999). The learning rate is linearly warmed up over the first 10% steps and then linearly decayed. We set the batch size as 96 and train LiLT BASE for 5 epochs on the IIT-CDIP dataset using 4 NVIDIA A40 48GB GPUs.\n2. In this paper, we initialize the text flow from the existing pre-trained English RoBERTa BASE (Liu et al., 2019b) (Chi et al., 2021) on the FUNSD and XFUND datasets (8 languages in total). The average F1 accuracy of language-specific semantic entity recognition (SER) task is given. in the number of parameters as 6.1M. The maximum sequence length N is set as 512.\n3. We pre-train LiLT on the IIT-CDIP Test Collection 1.0 (Lewis et al., 2006), which is a large-scale scanned document image dataset and contains more than 6 million documents with more than 11 million scanned document images. We use TextIn API 1 to obtain the text bounding boxes and strings for this dataset.\n4. extraction aims to predict the relation between any two given semantic entities, and we mainly focus on the key-value relation extraction. We use the official OCR results, and the same F1 accuracy evaluation metric as in LayoutXLM (Xu et al., 2021b) for Table 6, 7 and 8.\n5. RVL-CDIP RVL-CDIP (Harley et al., 2015) consists of 400,000 gray-scale images of English documents, with 8:1:1 for the training set, validation set, and test set. A multi-class single-label classification task is defined on RVL-CDIP. The images are categorized into 16 classes, with 25,000 images per class. The evaluation metric is the overall classification accuracy as shown in Table 5. Text and layout information are extracted by TextIn API.\n6. (Lewis et al., 2006) dataset (11 million English documents), resulting 30 million for pre-training with the LayoutLMv2 (Xu et al., 2021a) framework. However, this process is timeconsuming and laborious. On the contrary, LiLT can be pre-trained with only IIT-CDIP and then adapted to other languages. In this respect, LiLT is the first language-independent method for structured document understanding.\n7. cooperation. Moreover, we present the key point location (KPL) and crossmodal alignment identification (CAI) tasks, which are combined with the widely-used masked visual-language modeling (MVLM) to serve as our pretraining objectives. During fine-tuning, the layout flow (LiLT) can be separated and combined with the off-the-shelf pre-trained textual models (such as RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020), InfoXLM (Chi et al., 2021), etc) to deal with the downstream tasks.
