The main architecture of TVLT is a transformer [81] consisting of a 12-layer encoder (hidden size 768), E, and an 8-layer decoder (hidden size 512), D. We follow He et al. [26] and use a shallow decoder that only serves for masked autoencoding objective (Sec. 4.2) and has much fewer computations than the encoder. After pretraining, we only use the encoder representation for finetuning on downstream tasks.\n2. We introduce TVLT: Textless Vision-Language Transformer, a minimal end-to-end vision-andlanguage transformer model that accepts a list of embeddings obtained directly from perception-level video and audio input without text-specific modules, as depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.\n3. The input embeddings of TVLT are the sum of (1) modality embedding, (2) temporal/spatial embedding for video, (3) temporal/frequency embedding for audio, and (4) vision/audio patch embedding. As illustrated by the red and blue boxes in Fig. 2 to incorporate the temporal and spatial information for each input patch. We treat image input as a single frame video so that our model can handle both image and video tasks without modification of the architecture [9]. Temporal embedding is only added for video\n4. Audio Embeddings. To obtain audio embeddings, we first convert the 1D waveform of the raw audio signal to 128-dimensional log Mel-spectrogram having a dimension of T \u00d7 128 (time axis \u00d7 frequency axis). 2 Then, we treat the audio spectrogram as an image, divide the spectrogram images into patches, and apply a liner projection layer on each patch to obtain a 768-dimensional patch embedding. This follows the audio embedding methods in recent work [19; 20; 7], where a similar modality-agnostic transformer is\n5. used to model spectrogram patches. We experiment with two different patch sizes: 16 \u00d7 16 (square patches similar to the vision modality) and 2 \u00d7 128 (the same area as the first one but covers the entire frequency domain with a shorter time range) and use trainable temporal and frequency embeddings to indicate the temporal and frequency information of patches. 3\n6. By virtue of our minimal and modality-agnostic design, TVLT is pretrained with two objectives: (1) vision-audio matching (Sec.\n7.

Therefore, our models pretrained with the two datasets might not have a good performance on non-English tasks without additional pretraining.\n5. In this appendix, we include the pretraining dataset combination experiment (Appendix A), TTS-based text-to-video retrieval experiment (Sec. 6.3), ASR quality experiment (Appendix B), implementation details (Appendix C), finetuning on unimodal ASR task (Appendix D), visualization of MAE reconstruction (Appendix E), limitations and potential negative impacts (Appendix F), and licenses (Appendix G).\n6.

Firstly, we use sentence-piece [36] tokenizer and then map each token to trainable vectors to encode the raw text into embeddings, instead of converting the continuous input of frames or spectrograms into patch embeddings as in vanilla TVLT. Secondly, we follow the norm in mask language modeling [15] to use an affine layer as the decoder to recover masked words and set the mask\n9. Text-based Representation Learning.

HowTo100M. We used HowTo100M [52], a dataset containing 136M video clips of a total of 134,472 hours from 1.22M YouTube videos to pretrain our model. Our vanilla TVLT is pretrained directly using the frame and audio stream of the video clips. Our text-based TVLT is trained using the frame and caption stream of the video. The captions are automatically generated ASR provided in the dataset. We used 0.92M videos for pretraining, as some links to the videos were invalid to download.\n2. we randomly sample a 15s video clip from the entire video to form a setting similar to HowTo100M dataset. Concretely, the original dataset provides 100 label files which are random split of the dataset. We sample 20% of YTTemporal180M (0.93M videos) so that the resulting subset consists of a similar number of videos to HowTo100M (0.92M videos), and call it YTT-S. In appendix, we show that pretraining TVLT on YTT-S can improve the downstream task performance of over pretraining on HowTo100M.\n3. The input embeddings of TVLT are the sum of (1) modality embedding, (2) temporal/spatial embedding for video, (3) temporal/frequency embedding for audio, and (4) vision/audio patch embedding. As illustrated by the red and blue boxes in Fig. 2 to incorporate the temporal and spatial information for each input patch. We treat image input as a single frame video so that our model can handle both image and video tasks without modification of the architecture [9]. Temporal embedding is only added for video\n4. YTTemporal180M. YTTemporal180M [87] includes 180M video segments from 6M YouTube videos that spans multiple domains, and topics, including instructional videos from HowTo100M [52], lifestyle vlogs of everyday events from the VLOG dataset [29], and YouTube's auto-suggested videos for popular topics like 'science' or 'home improvement'. Each video segment consists of 1) an image frame extracted from the middle timestep of the segment, and 2) an ASR-based caption of L=32 BPE [18; 68] tokens. For each sample,\n5. Audio Embeddings. To obtain audio embeddings, we first convert the 1D waveform of the raw audio signal to 128-dimensional log Mel-spectrogram having a dimension of T \u00d7 128 (time axis \u00d7 frequency axis). 2 Then, we treat the audio spectrogram as an image, divide the spectrogram images into patches, and apply a liner projection layer on each patch to obtain a 768-dimensional patch embedding. This follows the audio embedding methods in recent work [19; 20; 7], where a similar modality-agnostic transformer is\n6. In our experiment, we pre-train TVLT on HowTo100M and YTtemporal videos.

Although ASR helps reduce the input length in transformers (as indicated by the VL module latency decrease), TVLT is more than 27x and 28x faster than text-based TVLT for inference with video input lengths of 10s and 20s, respectively, with only 1/3 of the parameters. The comparison is also shown in Fig. 1.\n3. In Table 15, we show the detailed latency for each audio processing pipeline for two different audio length settings: 10s and 20s. In both settings, ASR takes significantly longer processing time than all other modules and becomes the bottleneck of the entire vision-and-language pipeline. To explore whether the cross-modal representation of TVLT is useful for unimodal tasks, we experiment using TVLT as an audio encoder for an ASR model. Specifically, we construct a 4-layer transformer language model that\n4. attends to TVLT encoder outputs via cross-attentions and jointly train the encoder and decoder. We experiment with two settings: where the TVLT encoder is randomly initialized or initialized with V+A pretraining. We train the models on LibriSpeech [57], a widely used ASR corpus with 960 hours of English audiobooks, and evaluate them on its two dev sets, dev-clean and dev-other. As shown in Table 16, our ASR model with V+A pretrained TVLT encoder outperforms the No-pretrain baseline by 0.8 (dev-clean) and\n5. sentiment analysis (CMU-MOSEI) task with a simple modality-agnostic design. Similarly, Table 7 shows that TVLT achieves competitive results with AVLnet [63] and MILAN [64] on audio-to-image retrieval (Places-400k). Note that MILAN 7 is pretrained on Conceptual Spoken Caption [30] which contains 3.3M well-aligned image-speech pairs taken from Conceptual Captions [69] with TTS generated speech, whereas our TVLT is able to elicit effective representation from video inputs where vision-and-language clues are\n6. To compare the audio-based and text-based language representations for vision-and-language tasks, we pretrain our TVLT and its text-based counterpart on video datasets. Then, we finetune the models on a set of downstream vision-and-language datasets for evaluation.\n7. in a more adaptable representation.  ), which sheds light on the effectiveness of TVLT. Although there is still a gap between TVLT and text-based TVLT with higher quality ASR or ground truth transcript input, we expect that TVLT can be further improved with larger-scale pretraining (e.g., full YTTemporal180M dataset) on raw video signals.\n8. text-based counterpart while achieving comparable performance. We comprehensively analyze the efficiency of our model and show ablation studies over different training variants. We hope that our research will inspire further exploration of simple and efficient vision-and-language frameworks with low-level signals.\n9. Note that the TVLT framework is a language-agnostic method, so one can adapt our model to a non-English dataset without any architectural change. Furthermore, our architecture eliminates the need for external ASR modules, which reduces the computation of the typical vision-and-language pipeline.

This suggests the model may perform better on tasks related to these domains and contexts.\n- The model is language-agnostic and can be adapted to non-English datasets without architectural changes (Reference 1). However, since the pretraining datasets are mostly in English, the model might not perform as well on non-English tasks without additional pretraining (Reference 2).\n\nPopulation Subgroups:\n- [More Information Needed] The provided references do not contain specific information about the model's performance across different population subgroups.\n\nEvaluation and Disaggregation:\n- [More Information Needed] The references do not provide details on how the model's evaluation is disaggregated across different factors to uncover performance disparities.\n\nOther Factors:\n- The model's performance may be influenced by the audio masking strategy, encoder/decoder architectures, and pretraining objectives used during training (Reference 8).\n- The model uses a joint encoder for visual and audio modalities, which may affect its performance compared to modality-specific encoders (Reference 7).\n- The model's reliance on pretraining to achieve decent performance on visual-linguistic tasks may have environmental implications, although the model's architecture helps reduce pretraining computation compared to vision-and-language models with explicit text-based modules (Reference 3)."}

The main architecture of TVLT is a transformer [81] consisting of a 12-layer encoder (hidden size 768), E, and an 8-layer decoder (hidden size 512), D. We follow He et al. [26] and use a shallow decoder that only serves for masked autoencoding objective (Sec. 4.2) and has much fewer computations than the encoder. After pretraining, we only use the encoder representation for finetuning on downstream tasks.\n2. We introduce TVLT: Textless Vision-Language Transformer, a minimal end-to-end vision-andlanguage transformer model that accepts a list of embeddings obtained directly from perception-level video and audio input without text-specific modules, as depicted in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.\n3. The input embeddings of TVLT are the sum of (1) modality embedding, (2) temporal/spatial embedding for video, (3) temporal/frequency embedding for audio, and (4) vision/audio patch embedding. As illustrated by the red and blue boxes in Fig. 2 to incorporate the temporal and spatial information for each input patch. We treat image input as a single frame video so that our model can handle both image and video tasks without modification of the architecture [9]. Temporal embedding is only added for video\n4. used to model spectrogram patches. We experiment with two different patch sizes: 16 \u00d7 16 (square patches similar to the vision modality) and 2 \u00d7 128 (the same area as the first one but covers the entire frequency domain with a shorter time range) and use trainable temporal and frequency embeddings to indicate the temporal and frequency information of patches. 3\n5. Audio Embeddings. To obtain audio embeddings, we first convert the 1D waveform of the raw audio signal to 128-dimensional log Mel-spectrogram having a dimension of T \u00d7 128 (time axis \u00d7 frequency axis). 2 Then, we treat the audio spectrogram as an image, divide the spectrogram images into patches, and apply a liner projection layer on each patch to obtain a 768-dimensional patch embedding.

Despite the removal of text-based modules and modality-specific designs, TVLT achieves results comparable to its text-based counterparts in multimodal tasks (with either direct audio input, or text converted to audio input via TTS) such as visual question answering, image retrieval, video retrieval, and multimodal sentiment analysis, while being computationally efficient with 1/3 parameters and a 28x faster inference speed, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
