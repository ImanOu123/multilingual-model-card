We train DETR with AdamW setting learning rate in the transformer to 1e-4 and 1e-5 in the backbone.\nHorizontal flips, scales and crops are used for augmentation.\nImages are rescaled to have min size 800 and max size 1333.\nThe transformer is trained with dropout of 0.1, and the whole model is trained with grad clip of 0.1.\n2. We show that DETR achieves competitive results compared to Faster R-CNN in quantitative evaluation on COCO. Then, we provide a detailed ablation study of the architecture and loss, with insights and qualitative results. Finally, to show that DETR is a versatile and extensible model, we present results on panoptic segmentation, training only a small extension on a fixed DETR model. We provide code and pretrained models to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr.\n3. Two ingredients are essential for direct set predictions in detection: (1) a set prediction loss that forces unique matching between predicted and ground truth boxes; (2) an architecture that predicts (in a single pass) a set of objects and models their relation. We describe our architecture in detail in Figure 2.\n4. We recommend training segmentation in two stages: first train DETR to detect all the boxes, and then train the segmentation head.\nFor panoptic segmentation, DETR must learn to detect boxes for both stuff and things classes. You can train it on a single node with 8 gpus for 300 epochs with:\n```\npython -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env main.py --coco_path /path/to/coco  --coco_panoptic_path /path/to/coco_panoptic --dataset_file coco_panoptic --output_dir /output/path/box_model\n```\n5.

The overall DETR architecture is surprisingly simple and depicted in Figure 2. It contains three main components, which we describe below: a CNN backbone to extract a compact feature representation, an encoder-decoder transformer, and a simple feed forward network (FFN) that makes the final detection prediction. Unlike many modern detectors, DETR can be implemented in any deep learning framework that provides a common CNN backbone and a transformer architecture implementation with just a few hundred lines.\n7. encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection\n8. We present a new method that views object detection as a direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer\n9. Our DEtection TRansformer (DETR, see Figure 1) predicts all objects at once, and is trained end-to-end with a set loss function which performs bipartite matching between predicted and ground-truth objects. DETR simplifies the detection pipeline by dropping multiple hand-designed components that encode prior knowledge, like spatial anchors or non-maximal suppression.

The detailed description of the transformer used in DETR, with positional encodings passed at every attention layer, is given in Fig. 10. Image features from the CNN backbone are passed through the transformer encoder, together with spatial positional encoding that are added to queries and keys at every multihead self-attention layer.

We presented DETR, a new design for object detection systems based on transformers and bipartite matching loss for direct set prediction. The approach achieves comparable results to an optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO dataset. DETR is straightforward to implement and has a flexible architecture that is easily extensible to panoptic segmentation, with competitive results. In addition, it achieves significantly better performance on large objects than Faster R-CNN, likely thanks to the\n2. This new design for detectors also comes with new challenges, in particular regarding training, optimization and performances on small objects. Current detectors required several years of improvements to cope with similar issues, and we expect future work to successfully address them for DETR.\n3. In our case, the positional encodings may be learnt or fixed, but are shared across all attention layers for a given query/key-value sequence, so we do not explicitly write them as parameters of the attention. We give more details on their exact value when describing the encoder and the decoder. The final output is the aggregation of values weighted by attention weights: The i-th row is given by attn i (X q , X kv , T ) = N kv j=1 \u03b1 i,j V j . Feed-forward network (FFN) layers The original transformer\n4. alternates multi-head attention and so-called FFN layers [47], which are effectively multilayer 1x1 convolutions, which have M d input and output channels in our case. The FFN we consider is composed of two-layers of 1x1 convolutions with ReLU activations. There is also a residual connection/dropout/layernorm after the two layers, similarly to equation 6.\n5.

Our DEtection TRansformer (DETR, see Figure 1) predicts all objects at once, and is trained end-to-end with a set loss function which performs bipartite matching between predicted and ground-truth objects. DETR simplifies the detection pipeline by dropping multiple hand-designed components that encode prior knowledge, like spatial anchors or non-maximal suppression. Unlike most existing detection methods, DETR doesn't require any customized layers, and thus can be reproduced easily in any framework that\n7. dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines.

Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nHow the model may foreseeably be misused and address what users ought not do with the model facebook/detr-resnet-101.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model facebook/detr-resnet-101.

We observe that each slot has several modes of operation focusing on different areas and box sizes. In particular, all slots have the mode for predicting image-wide boxes (visible as the red dots aligned in the middle of the plot). We hypothesize that this is related to the distribution of objects in COCO.\n5.

Researchers and practitioners are actively working on addressing these limitations through architectural improvements, training strategies, and domain-specific adaptations.", "When considering the use of the facebook/detr-resnet-101 model, there are a few potential issues to keep in mind and recommendations to address them:\n\n1. Computational requirements: The DETR (DEtection TRansformer) model, especially with a ResNet-101 backbone, is computationally intensive. It may require significant GPU resources and longer inference times compared to some other object detection models. Recommendation: Ensure that you have sufficient computational resources, particularly GPU power, to efficiently run the model. Consider the trade-off between accuracy and inference speed based on your specific use case.\n\n2. Limited context understanding: While the DETR model achieves impressive object detection performance, it may struggle with understanding the broader context and relationships between objects in complex scenes. Recommendation: If your application requires a deeper understanding of object relationships and scene context, consider complementing the DETR model with additional techniques or models specifically designed for scene understanding or relationship reasoning.\n\n3. Domain adaptation: The DETR model is typically trained on large-scale datasets like COCO, which cover a wide range of object categories. However, if your application domain differs significantly from the training data, the model's performance may degrade. Recommendation: If you are working with a specific domain or unique object categories, consider fine-tuning the DETR model on a domain-specific dataset to improve its performance and adapt it to your specific use case.\n\n4. Robustness to occlusions and truncations: Like many object detection models, DETR may face challenges in detecting heavily occluded or truncated objects. Recommendation: If your application involves scenes with significant occlusions or truncations, consider incorporating additional techniques, such as part-based detection or occlusion-aware models, to improve the model's robustness in such scenarios.\n\n5. Model size and storage: The facebook/detr-resnet-101 model has a relatively large number of parameters, which can result in a significant model size. Recommendation: If model size and storage are critical concerns for your application, consider exploring model compression techniques, such as quantization or pruning, to reduce the model's size without significantly compromising its performance.\n\nBy considering these potential issues and recommendations, you can make informed decisions on whether the facebook/detr-resnet-101 model is suitable for your specific use case and how to address any foreseeable challenges effectively."], "answer": ["Our DEtection TRansformer (DETR, see Figure 1) predicts all objects at once, and is trained end-to-end with a set loss function which performs bipartite matching between predicted and ground-truth objects.

Increasing the number of instances By design, DETR cannot predict more objects than it has query slots, i.e. 100 in our experiments. In this section, we analyze the behavior of DETR when approaching this limit. We select a canonical square image of a given class, repeat it on a 10 \u00d7 10 grid, and compute the percentage of instances that are missed by the model. To test the model with less than 100", "We show that DETR achieves competitive results compared to Faster R-CNN in quantitative evaluation on COCO.

Attention mechanisms in the transformer decoder are the key components which model relations between feature representations of different detections. In our ablation analysis, we explore how other components of our architecture and loss influence the final performance. For the study we choose ResNet-50-based DETR model with 6 encoder, 6 decoder layers and width 256. The model has 41.3M parameters, achieves 40.6 and 42.0 AP on short and long schedules respectively, and runs at 28 FPS, similarly to Faster\n2. loss, DETR does not need NMS by design. To verify this we run a standard NMS procedure with default parameters [50] for the outputs after each decoder. NMS improves performance for the predictions from the first decoder. This can be explained by the fact that a single decoding layer of the transformer is not able to compute any cross-correlations between the output elements, and thus it is prone to making multiple predictions for the same object. In the second and subsequent layers, the self-attention\n3. We presented DETR, a new design for object detection systems based on transformers and bipartite matching loss for direct set prediction. The approach achieves comparable results to an optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO dataset. DETR is straightforward to implement and has a flexible architecture that is easily extensible to panoptic segmentation, with competitive results. In addition, it achieves significantly better performance on large objects than Faster R-CNN, likely thanks to the\n4. This new design for detectors also comes with new challenges, in particular regarding training, optimization and performances on small objects. Current detectors required several years of improvements to cope with similar issues, and we expect future work to successfully address them for DETR.\n5. passing any spatial encodings in the encoder only leads to a minor AP drop of 1.3 AP. When we pass the encodings to the attentions, they are shared across all layers, and the output encodings (object queries) are always learned. Given these ablations, we conclude that transformer components: the global self-attention in encoder, FFN, multiple decoder layers, and positional encodings, all significantly contribute to the final object detection performance.\n6. Generalization to unseen numbers of instances. Some classes in COCO are not well represented with many instances of the same class in the same image. For example, there is no image with more than 13 giraffes in the training set. We create a synthetic image 3 to verify the generalization ability of DETR (see Figure 5). Our model is able to find all 24 giraffes on the image which is clearly out of distribution. This experiment confirms that there is no strong class-specialization in each object query.\n7. Decoder output slot analysis In Fig. 7 we visualize the boxes predicted by different slots for all images in COCO 2017 val set. DETR learns different specialization for each query slot. We observe that each slot has several modes of operation focusing on different areas and box sizes. In particular, all slots have the mode for predicting image-wide boxes (visible as the red dots aligned in the middle of the plot). We hypothesize that this is related to the distribution of objects in COCO.\n8. In our case, the positional encodings may be learnt or fixed, but are shared across all attention layers for a given query/key-value sequence, so we do not explicitly write them as parameters of the attention. We give more details on their exact value when describing the encoder and the decoder. The final output is the aggregation of values weighted by attention weights: The i-th row is given by attn i (X q , X kv , T ) = N kv j=1 \u03b1 i,j V j .
