Our masked autoencoder (MAE) is a simple autoencoding approach that reconstructs the original signal given its partial observation. Like all autoencoders, our approach has an encoder that maps the observed signal to a latent representation, and a decoder that reconstructs the original signal from the latent representation. Unlike classical autoencoders, we adopt an asymmetric design that allows the encoder to operate only on the partial, observed signal (without mask tokens) and a lightweight decoder that\n2. Simple implementation. Our MAE pre-training can be implemented efficiently, and importantly, does not require any specialized sparse operations. First we generate a token for every input patch (by linear projection with an added positional embedding). Next we randomly shuffle the list of tokens and remove the last portion of the list, based on the masking ratio. This process produces a small subset of tokens for the encoder and is equivalent to sampling patches without replacement. After encoding, we\n3. Random sampling with a high masking ratio (i.e., the ratio of removed patches) largely eliminates redundancy, thus creating a task that cannot be easily solved by extrapolation from visible neighboring patches (see Figures 2 -4). The uniform distribution prevents a potential center bias (i.e., more masked patches near the image center). Finally, the highly sparse input creates an opportunity for designing an efficient encoder, introduced next. MAE encoder. Our encoder is a ViT [16] but applied only on\n4. visible, unmasked patches. Just as in a standard ViT, our encoder embeds patches by a linear projection with added positional embeddings, and then processes the resulting set via a series of Transformer blocks. However, our encoder only operates on a small subset (e.g., 25%) of the full set. Masked patches are removed; no mask tokens are used. This allows us to train very large encoders with only a fraction of compute and memory. The full set is handled by a lightweight decoder, described next.\n5. MAE decoder. The input to the MAE decoder is the full set of tokens consisting of (i) encoded visible patches, and (ii) mask tokens. See Figure 1. Each mask token [14] is a shared, learned vector that indicates the presence of a miss-ing patch to be predicted. We add positional embeddings to all tokens in this full set; without this, mask tokens would have no information about their location in the image. The decoder has another series of Transformer blocks.\n6. This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask\n7. Our MAE learns very high-capacity models that generalize well. With MAE pre-training, we can train datahungry models like ViT-Large/-Huge [16] on ImageNet-1K with improved generalization performance. With a vanilla ViT-Huge model, we achieve 87.8% accuracy when finetuned on ImageNet-1K. This outperforms all previous results that use only ImageNet-1K data. We also evaluate transfer learning on object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. In these tasks, our pre-training achieves\n8. tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task.

Our MAE learns very high-capacity models that generalize well. With MAE pre-training, we can train datahungry models like ViT-Large/-Huge [16] on ImageNet-1K with improved generalization performance. With a vanilla ViT-Huge model, we achieve 87.8% accuracy when finetuned on ImageNet-1K. This outperforms all previous results that use only ImageNet-1K data. We also evaluate transfer learning on object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. In these tasks, our pre-training achieves\n7. Comparisons with supervised pre-training. In the original ViT paper [16], ViT-L degrades when trained in IN1K. Our implementation of supervised training (see A.2) works better, but accuracy saturates. See Figure 8.\nOur MAE pre-training, using only IN1K, can generalize better: the gain over training from scratch is bigger for higher-capacity models. It follows a trend similar to the JFT-300M supervised pre-training in [16]. This comparison shows that our MAE can help scale up model sizes.\n8. tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3\u00d7 or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data.

Bias and fairness: The model's performance may be influenced by biases present in the training data, which could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes when applied to real-world scenarios. The model might perpetuate or amplify societal biases related to factors such as race, gender, or age.\n\n2. Privacy concerns: The model requires large amounts of visual data for training, which may raise privacy concerns if the data includes sensitive or personally identifiable information. There is a risk of the model learning and potentially exposing private information from the training data.\n\n3. Computational resources: The vit-mae-huge model is computationally intensive, requiring significant resources for training and inference. This may limit its accessibility and deployment in resource-constrained environments, such as on edge devices or in regions with limited computational infrastructure.\n\n4. Interpretability and transparency: Like many deep learning models, the vit-mae-huge model is often considered a \"black box,\" making it difficult to interpret and explain its decision-making process. This lack of transparency can be problematic in domains where accountability and explainability are crucial, such as in healthcare or legal applications.\n\n5. Generalization and robustness: While the model may perform well on the tasks and datasets it was trained on, its ability to generalize to new and unseen scenarios may be limited.

Computational requirements: The ViT-MAE-huge model is a large-scale model with a significant number of parameters. This means that it requires substantial computational resources, such as high-performance GPUs or TPUs, to train and deploy effectively. The computational demands may limit its accessibility and usability for some researchers and practitioners with limited resources.\n\n2. Generalization ability: While the ViT-MAE-huge model has demonstrated impressive performance on various computer vision tasks, its ability to generalize to new and unseen data may be a concern. The model's performance on out-of-distribution data or data from different domains may not be as robust as its performance on the training data. Thorough evaluation and testing on diverse datasets are necessary to assess its generalization capabilities.\n\n3. Interpretability and transparency: Like many deep learning models, the ViT-MAE-huge model is a black-box model, meaning that its internal decision-making processes are not easily interpretable or explainable. This lack of transparency can be problematic in certain applications where understanding the model's reasoning is crucial, such as in medical diagnosis or autonomous vehicles. Efforts to improve the interpretability of the model may be necessary for some use cases.\n\n4. Bias and fairness: The ViT-MAE-huge model is trained on large-scale datasets, which may contain biases or underrepresentation of certain groups or demographics.

One foreseeable issue is the model's large size, which may require significant computational resources and longer processing times. It is recommended to ensure that the hardware and infrastructure can support the model's requirements before implementation.\n\nAnother potential issue is the model's reliance on pre-training on a large dataset. While this enables the model to perform well on a wide range of tasks, it may also introduce biases present in the training data. It is recommended to carefully evaluate the model's performance on specific tasks and datasets relevant to the intended application and to consider fine-tuning the model on domain-specific data to improve its accuracy and reduce bias.\n\nAdditionally, as with any deep learning model, there is a risk of the model making incorrect predictions or exhibiting unexpected behavior in certain situations.

The following is a comparison between ViT-L trained from scratch vs. fine-tuned from our baseline MAE: scratch, original [16]  We note that it is nontrivial to train supervised ViT-L from scratch and a good recipe with strong regularization is needed (82.5%, see Appendix A.2). Even so, our MAE pretraining contributes a big\n3. We extract features from the encoder output for finetuning and linear probing. As ViT has a class token [16], to adapt to this design, in our MAE pre-training we append an auxiliary dummy token to the encoder input. This token will be treated as the class token for training the classifier in linear probing and fine-tuning. Our MAE works similarly well without this token (with average pooling).\n4. We do self-supervised pre-training on the ImageNet-1K (IN1K) [13] training set. Then we do supervised training to evaluate the representations with (i) end-to-end fine-tuning or (ii) linear probing. We report top-1 validation accuracy of a single 224\u00d7224 crop. Details are in Appendix A.1.\n5. Pre-training. The default setting is in Table 8. We do not use color jittering, drop path, or gradient clip. We use xavier uniform [18] to initialize all Transformer blocks, following ViT's official code [16]. We use the linear lr scaling rule [20]: lr = base lr\u00d7batchsize / 256.\nEnd-to-end fine-tuning. Our fine-tuning follows common practice of supervised ViT training. The default setting is in Table 9. We use layer-wise lr decay [10] following [2].\n6. Training schedule. Our ablations thus far are based on 800-epoch pre-training. Figure 7 shows the influence of the training schedule length. The accuracy improves steadily with longer training. Indeed, we have not observed saturation of linear probing accuracy even at 1600 epochs. This behavior is unlike contrastive learning methods, e.g., MoCo v3 [9] saturates at 300 epochs for ViT-L. Note that the MAE encoder only sees 25% of patches per epoch, while in contrastive learning the encoder sees 200%\n7. In MAE, the role of data augmentation is mainly performed by random masking (ablated next). The masks are different for each iteration and so they generate new training samples regardless of data augmentation. The pretext task is made difficult by masking and requires less augmentation to regularize training.\nMask sampling strategy. In Table 1f we compare different mask sampling strategies, illustrated in Figure 6.\n8. can be absorbed into the linear classifier after training: it is essentially a reparameterized linear classifier. 3 Introducing this layer helps calibrate the feature magnitudes across different variants in our ablations, so that they can use the same setting without further lr search.

We use layer-wise lr decay [10] following [2].\n8. can be absorbed into the linear classifier after training: it is essentially a reparameterized linear classifier. 3 Introducing this layer helps calibrate the feature magnitudes across different variants in our ablations, so that they can use the same setting without further lr search.  Partial fine-tuning. Our MAE partial fine-tuning ( \u00a74.3) follows the setting in Table 9, except that we adjust the number of fine-tuning epochs. We observe that tuning fewer blocks requires a longer schedule. We set the\n9. mask tokens to the small decoder in our asymmetric encoder-decoder results in a large reduction in computation. Under this design, a very high masking ratio (e.g., 75%) can achieve a win-win scenario: it optimizes accuracy while allowing the encoder to process only a small portion (e.g., 25%) of patches. This can reduce overall pre-training time by 3\u00d7 or more and likewise reduce memory consumption, enabling us to easily scale our MAE to large models.\n10. Driven by this analysis, we present a simple, effective, and scalable form of a masked autoencoder (MAE) for visual representation learning. Our MAE masks random patches from the input image and reconstructs the missing patches in the pixel space. It has an asymmetric encoderdecoder design. Our encoder operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), and our decoder is lightweight and reconstructs the input from the latent representation along with mask tokens (Figure 1). Shifting the\n11. tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3\u00d7 or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data.

Visual domain: The model's performance will be affected by the visual domain it was trained on. If the model was primarily trained on natural images, it may not perform as well on specialized domains like medical imaging or satellite imagery without additional fine-tuning.\n\n2. Image resolution: The model's behavior will be influenced by the resolution of the input images. If the model was trained on high-resolution images, it may not generalize well to low-resolution or blurry images.\n\n3. Object scale and orientation: The model's ability to recognize objects may be affected by their scale and orientation within the image. If the model was primarily trained on objects at a certain scale or orientation, it may struggle with objects that deviate significantly from those norms.\n\n4. Lighting and color: Variations in lighting conditions and color schemes can impact the model's performance. If the model was trained on images with consistent lighting and color, it may not generalize well to images with drastically different lighting or color characteristics.\n\n5. Cultural and geographical context: The model's understanding of visual concepts may be biased towards the cultural and geographical contexts represented in its training data. This can lead to misinterpretations or misclassifications when applied to images from underrepresented contexts.\n\n6. Adversarial examples: Like other deep learning models, ViT-MAE-huge may be susceptible to adversarial examples \u2013 carefully crafted input images designed to fool the model into making incorrect predictions.\n\nUnderstanding these domain and context characteristics is crucial for appropriately applying the ViT-MAE-huge model and interpreting its outputs. Fine-tuning the model on task-specific data and regularly monitoring its performance can help mitigate some of these challenges.", "When considering the potential impact of population subgroup characteristics on the behavior of the Facebook ViT-MAE-huge model, several factors come into play. This model, being a large-scale vision transformer trained using a masked autoencoder approach, may exhibit varying performance across different demographics.\n\nOne key characteristic that could influence the model's behavior is the diversity of the training data. If the dataset used to train the model is not representative of various age groups, ethnicities, genders, or cultural backgrounds, the model might perform differently when applied to underrepresented subgroups. For instance, if the training data predominantly features images of younger individuals, the model may struggle to accurately analyze images of older people.\n\nMoreover, the model's performance could be affected by variations in facial features, skin tones, and clothing styles associated with different ethnic or cultural groups. If the training data does not adequately capture these variations, the model may exhibit bias or reduced accuracy when processing images from specific subgroups.\n\nAdditionally, gender biases present in the training data could lead to the model perpetuating or amplifying stereotypes. If the dataset contains more images of men in certain contexts or roles compared to women, the model may develop biased associations or make inaccurate predictions based on gender.\n\nSocioeconomic factors could also play a role in how the model behaves. If the training data is skewed towards images representing individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, the model may not perform as well when analyzing images from underrepresented or marginalized communities.\n\nTo mitigate these potential issues, it is crucial to ensure that the training data used for the Facebook ViT-MAE-huge model is diverse, inclusive, and representative of various population subgroups. Regular audits and evaluations should be conducted to identify and address any biases or disparities in the model's performance across different demographics. By actively promoting fairness and inclusivity in the training process, the model can be better equipped to provide accurate and unbiased results for a wide range of population subgroups.", "Based on the available information about the Facebook ViT-MAE-huge model, there is no clear indication that the evaluation of the model's performance has been disaggregated across various factors to uncover potential disparities. The model's documentation and associated research papers do not explicitly mention any analysis of performance disparities across different subgroups or factors such as demographics, geographic regions, or other relevant categories.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that uncovering performance disparities is a crucial aspect of responsible AI development and deployment. Evaluating the model's performance across different factors can help identify any biases or unequal performance that may exist, enabling developers to address these issues and ensure fairness in the model's outputs. Without such disaggregated evaluation, there is a risk that the model's performance may be uneven across different subgroups, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.\n\nTo comprehensively answer this question, it would be necessary to review the model's evaluation methodology and results in detail, or to contact the developers directly for more information on their approach to assessing performance disparities."]}

If the model was primarily trained on natural images, it may not perform as well on specialized domains like medical imaging or satellite imagery without additional fine-tuning.\n\n2. Image resolution: The model's behavior will be influenced by the resolution of the input images. If the model was trained on high-resolution images, it may not generalize well to low-resolution or blurry images.\n\n3. Object scale and orientation: The model's ability to recognize objects may be affected by their scale and orientation within the image. If the model was primarily trained on objects at a certain scale or orientation, it may struggle with objects that deviate significantly from those norms.\n\n4. Lighting and color: Variations in lighting conditions and color schemes can impact the model's performance. If the model was trained on images with consistent lighting and color, it may not generalize well to images with drastically different lighting or color characteristics.\n\n5. Cultural and geographical context: The model's understanding of visual concepts may be biased towards the cultural and geographical contexts represented in its training data. This can lead to misinterpretations or misclassifications when applied to images from underrepresented contexts.\n\n6. Adversarial examples: Like other deep learning models, ViT-MAE-huge may be susceptible to adversarial examples \u2013 carefully crafted input images designed to fool the model into making incorrect predictions.\n\nUnderstanding these domain and context characteristics is crucial for appropriately applying the ViT-MAE-huge model and interpreting its outputs. Fine-tuning the model on task-specific data and regularly monitoring its performance can help mitigate some of these challenges.", "When considering the potential impact of population subgroup characteristics on the behavior of the Facebook ViT-MAE-huge model, several factors come into play. This model, being a large-scale vision transformer trained using a masked autoencoder approach, may exhibit varying performance across different demographics.\n\nOne key characteristic that could influence the model's behavior is the diversity of the training data. If the dataset used to train the model is not representative of various age groups, ethnicities, genders, or cultural backgrounds, the model might perform differently when applied to underrepresented subgroups. For instance, if the training data predominantly features images of younger individuals, the model may struggle to accurately analyze images of older people.\n\nMoreover, the model's performance could be affected by variations in facial features, skin tones, and clothing styles associated with different ethnic or cultural groups. If the training data does not adequately capture these variations, the model may exhibit bias or reduced accuracy when processing images from specific subgroups.\n\nAdditionally, gender biases present in the training data could lead to the model perpetuating or amplifying stereotypes. If the dataset contains more images of men in certain contexts or roles compared to women, the model may develop biased associations or make inaccurate predictions based on gender.\n\nSocioeconomic factors could also play a role in how the model behaves. If the training data is skewed towards images representing individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, the model may not perform as well when analyzing images from underrepresented or marginalized communities.\n\nTo mitigate these potential issues, it is crucial to ensure that the training data used for the Facebook ViT-MAE-huge model is diverse, inclusive, and representative of various population subgroups.
