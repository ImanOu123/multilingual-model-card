Our results demonstrate that this approach attains state-ofart performance when CvT is pre-trained with ImageNet-1k, while being lightweight and efficient: CvT improves the performance compared to CNN-based models (e.g. ResNet) and prior Transformer-based models (e.g. ViT, DeiT) while utilizing fewer FLOPS and parameters.

The overall pipeline of the Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) is shown in Figure 2. We introduce two convolution-based operations into the Vision Transformer architecture, namely the Convolutional Token Embedding and Convolutional Projection. As shown in Figure 2 (a), a multi-stage hierarchy design borrowed from CNNs [20,15] is employed, where three stages in total are used in this work. Each stage has two parts. First, the input image (or 2D reshaped token maps) are subjected to the Convolutional\n3. In summary, our proposed Convolutional vision Trans-former (CvT) employs all the benefits of CNNs: local receptive fields, shared weights, and spatial subsampling, while keeping all the advantages of Transformers: dynamic attention, global context fusion, and better generalization.\n4. The CvT design introduces convolutions to two core sections of the ViT architecture. First, we partition the Transformers into multiple stages that form a hierarchical structure of Transformers. The beginning of each stage consists of a convolutional token embedding that performs an overlapping convolution operation with stride on a 2D-reshaped token map (i.e., reshaping flattened token sequences back to the spatial grid), followed by layer normalization. This allows the model to not only capture local\n5.

We instantiate models with different parameters and FLOPs by varying the number of Transformer blocks of each stage and the hidden feature dimension used, as shown in Table 2. Three stages are adapted. We define CvT-13 and CvT-21 as basic models, with 19.98M and 31.54M paramters. CvT-X stands for Convolutional vision Transformer with X Transformer Blocks in total. Additionally, we experiment with a wider model with a larger token dimension for each stage, namely CvT-W24 (W stands for Wide), resulting 298.3M\n9. We further investigate the ability of our models to transfer by fine-tuning models on various tasks, with all models being pre-trained on ImageNet-22k. Table 4 shows the results. Our CvT-W24 model is able to obtain the best performance across all the downstream tasks considered, even when compared to the large BiT-R152x4 [18] model, which has more than 3\u00d7 the number of parameters as CvT-W24.\n10. ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pretrained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our results show that the positional encoding, a crucial component in existing Vision Transformers, can be safely removed in our model, simplifying the design for higher resolution vision tasks.

Three stages are adapted. We define CvT-13 and CvT-21 as basic models, with 19.98M and 31.54M paramters. CvT-X stands for Convolutional vision Transformer with X Transformer Blocks in total.

Pretrained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7% on the ImageNet-1k val set.

This comes with a minimal performance penalty, as neighboring pixels/patches in images tend to have redundancy in appearance/semantics. In addition, the local context modeling of the proposed Convolutional Projection compensates for the loss of information incurred by resolution reduction.\n3. First, we utilize efficient convolutions. Directly using standard s\u00d7s convolutions for the Convolutional Projection would require s 2 C 2 parameters and O(s 2 C 2 T ) FLOPs, where C is the token channel dimension, and T is the number of tokens for processing. Instead, we split the standard s \u00d7 s convolution into a depth-wise separable convolution [16]. In this way, each of the proposed Convolutional Projection would only introduce an extra of s 2 C parameters and O(s 2 CT ) FLOPs compared to the original\n4. The resulting new Transformer Block with the Convolutional Projection layer is a generalization of the original Transformer Block design. The original position-wise linear projection layer could be trivially implemented using a convolution layer with kernel size of 1 \u00d7 1.\n5. Second, we leverage the proposed Convolutional Projection to reduce the computation cost for the MHSA operation. The s \u00d7 s Convolutional Projection permits reducing the number of tokens by using a stride larger than 1. Figure 3 (c) shows the Convolutional Projection, where the key and value projection are subsampled by using a convolution with stride larger than 1. We use a stride of 2 for key and value projection, leaving the stride of 1 for query unchanged.

This suggests it is well-suited for general image classification tasks, but performance on more specialized domains would need further evaluation.\n\nPopulation Subgroups:\n[More Information Needed] - The references do not provide information on how the model performs across different population subgroups. Disaggregated evaluation across factors like demographics, geographies, etc. would be needed to uncover any performance disparities.\n\nOther Notable Characteristics:\n- The model incorporates convolutional projections and token embeddings, allowing it to model local spatial relationships without positional embeddings (References 3-6, 8). This simplifies the architecture for variable input resolutions common in vision tasks.\n- Despite having fewer parameters and lower computational cost than some other models, it achieved state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-1k (References 1, 10). However, computational efficiency on downstream tasks is not discussed.\n- Ablation studies validated the architecture design choices (Reference 2), but more details on the specific experiments would help assess robustness.\n\nIn summary, the microsoft/cvt-21-384-22k model shows promise for general image classification, with architecture innovations to efficiently handle vision tasks. However, more disaggregated evaluation is needed to characterize performance across different subgroups and specialized domains. The provided information focuses more on architecture than behavior across diverse contexts."}

We design various ablation experiments to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed components of our architecture. First, we show that with our introduction of convolutions, position embeddings can be removed from the      Convolutional Token Embedding We study the effectiveness of the proposed Convolutional Token Embedding, and Table 6 shows the results. Table 6d is the CvT-13 model. When we replace the Convolutional Token Embedding with non-overlapping Patch Embedding [11], the performance drops 0.8%\n2. (Table 6a v.s. Table 6d). When position embedding is used, the introduction of Convolutional Token Embedding still obtains 0.3% improvement (Table 6b v.s. Table 6c). Further, when using both Convolutional Token Embedding and position embedding as Table 6d, it slightly drops 0.1% accuracy. These results validate the introduction of Convolutional Token Embedding not only improves the performance, but also helps CvT model spatial relationships without position embedding.\n3. In this section, we evaluate the CvT model on large-scale image classification datasets and transfer to various downstream datasets. In addition, we perform through ablation studies to validate the design of the proposed architecture.\n4. Compared to Transformer based models, CvT achieves a much higher accuracy with fewer parameters and FLOPs. CvT-21 obtains a 82.5% ImageNet Top-1 accuracy, which is 0.5% higher than DeiT-B with the reduction of 63% parameters and 60% FLOPs. When comparing to concurrent works, CvT still shows superior advantages. With fewer paramerters, CvT-13 achieves a 81.6% ImageNet Top-1 accuracy, outperforming PVT-Small [34], T2T-ViT t -14 [41], TNT-S [14] by 1.7%, 0.8%, 0.2% respectively.\n5. Our architecture designing can be further improved in terms of model parameters and FLOPs by neural architecture search (NAS) [7]. In particular, we search the proper stride for each convolution projection of key and value (stride = 1, 2) and the expansion ratio for each MLP layer (ratio M LP = 2, 4). Such architecture candidates with FLOPs ranging from 2.59G to 4.03G and the num- Table 3: Accuracy of manual designed architecture on ImageNet [9], ImageNet Real [2] and ImageNet V2 matched frequency [26].\n6. We further investigate the ability of our models to transfer by fine-tuning models on various tasks, with all models being pre-trained on ImageNet-22k. Table 4 shows the results. Our CvT-W24 model is able to obtain the best performance across all the downstream tasks considered, even when compared to the large BiT-R152x4 [18] model, which has more than 3\u00d7 the number of parameters as CvT-W24.\n7. Convolutional Projection First, we compare the proposed Convolutional Projection with different strides in Table 7. By using a stride of 2 for key and value projection, we observe a 0.3% drop in ImageNet Top-1 accuracy, but with 30% fewer FLOPs. We choose to use Convolutional Projection with stride 2 for key and value as default for less computational cost and memory usage.\n8.

First, we utilize efficient convolutions. Directly using standard s\u00d7s convolutions for the Convolutional Projection would require s 2 C 2 parameters and O(s 2 C 2 T ) FLOPs, where C is the token channel dimension, and T is the number of tokens for processing. Instead, we split the standard s \u00d7 s convolution into a depth-wise separable convolution [16]. In this way, each of the proposed Convolutional Projection would only introduce an extra of s 2 C parameters and O(s 2 CT ) FLOPs compared to the original\n4. value is reduced 4 times, and the computational cost is reduced by 4 times for the later MHSA operation. This comes with a minimal performance penalty, as neighboring pixels/patches in images tend to have redundancy in appearance/semantics. In addition, the local context modeling of the proposed Convolutional Projection compensates for the loss of information incurred by resolution reduction.\n5. Second, we leverage the proposed Convolutional Projection to reduce the computation cost for the MHSA operation. The s \u00d7 s Convolutional Projection permits reducing the number of tokens by using a stride larger than 1. Figure 3 (c) shows the Convolutional Projection, where the key and value projection are subsampled by using a convolution with stride larger than 1. We use a stride of 2 for key and value projection, leaving the stride of 1 for query unchanged. In this way, the number of tokens for key and\n6.

In this way, each of the proposed Convolutional Projection would only introduce an extra of s 2 C parameters and O(s 2 CT ) FLOPs compared to the original\n3. x q/k/v i = Flatten (Conv2d (Reshape2D(x i ), s)) ,(2)\nwhere x q/k/v i is the token input for Q/K/V matrices at layer i, x i is the unperturbed token prior to the Convolutional Projection, Conv2d is a depth-wise separable convolution [5] implemented by: Depth-wise Conv2d \u2192 BatchNorm2d \u2192 Point-wise Conv2d, and s refers to the convolution kernel size.\n4. value is reduced 4 times, and the computational cost is reduced by 4 times for the later MHSA operation. This comes with a minimal performance penalty, as neighboring pixels/patches in images tend to have redundancy in appearance/semantics. In addition, the local context modeling of the proposed Convolutional Projection compensates for the loss of information incurred by resolution reduction.\n5. Second, we leverage the proposed Convolutional Projection to reduce the computation cost for the MHSA operation. The s \u00d7 s Convolutional Projection permits reducing the number of tokens by using a stride larger than 1. Figure 3 (c) shows the Convolutional Projection, where the key and value projection are subsampled by using a convolution with stride larger than 1. We use a stride of 2 for key and value projection, leaving the stride of 1 for query unchanged. In this way, the number of tokens for key and\n6. The resulting new Transformer Block with the Convolutional Projection layer is a generalization of the original Transformer Block design. The original position-wise linear projection layer could be trivially implemented using a convolution layer with kernel size of 1 \u00d7 1.\n7. We further investigate the ability of our models to transfer by fine-tuning models on various tasks, with all models being pre-trained on ImageNet-22k. Table 4 shows the results. Our CvT-W24 model is able to obtain the best performance across all the downstream tasks considered, even when compared to the large BiT-R152x4 [18] model, which has more than 3\u00d7 the number of parameters as CvT-W24.\n8. ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pretrained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our results show that the positional encoding, a crucial component in existing Vision Transformers, can be safely removed in our model, simplifying the design for higher resolution vision tasks. Code will be released at https: //github.com/leoxiaobin/CvT.\n9. Training AdamW [21] optimizer is used with the weight decay of 0.05 for our CvT-13, and 0.1 for our CvT-21 and CvT-W24. We train our models with an initial learning rate of 0.02 and a total batch size of 2048 for 300 epochs, with a cosine learning rate decay scheduler. We adopt the same data augmentation and regularization methods as in ViT [30]. Unless otherwise stated, all ImageNet models are trained with an 224 \u00d7 224 input size.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the compute infrastructure about the model microsoft/cvt-21-384-22k.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model microsoft/cvt-21-384-22k.
