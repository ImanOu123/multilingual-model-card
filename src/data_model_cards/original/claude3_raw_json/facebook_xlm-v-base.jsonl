In this subsection, we describe our method for constructing multilingual vocabularies. At a high level, we (1) train individual monolingual sentencepiece models (SPM) for each language in our dataset using the Unigram Language Model (ULM) algorithm (Kudo and Richardson, 2018), (2) use the per-language vocabularies to construct lexical representation vectors for each language, (3) cluster the lexical representation vectors using K-Means, assign vocabulary capacities for each cluster using the ALP, and then\n5. Training monolingual SPMs To acquire the data for building the vocabulary, we perform sampling with temperature t = 2 to sample 1 billion lines of text from CC100 (up-sampling lower-resource and down-sampling data from high resource languages). Then, for each language in CC100, we\nCluster |V c | Languages c1\n6. capacity to achieve sufficient coverage for each individual language. Tokenizations using our vocabulary are typically more semantically meaningful and shorter compared to XLM-R. Leveraging this improved vocabulary, we train XLM-V, a multilingual language model with a one million token vocabulary. XLM-V outperforms XLM-R on every task we tested on ranging from natural language inference (XNLI), question answering (MLQA, XQuAD, TyDiQA), to named entity recognition (WikiAnn). XLM-V is particularly effective\n7. Large multilingual language models typically rely on a single vocabulary shared across 100+ languages. As these models have increased in parameter count and depth, vocabulary size has remained largely unchanged. This vocabulary bottleneck limits the representational capabilities of multilingual models like XLM-R. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for scaling to very large multilingual vocabularies by de-emphasizing token sharing between languages with little lexical overlap and assigning vocabulary\n8. reducing over-tokenization for lowresource languages.

This model has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text data in 100 languages, allowing it to capture rich linguistic information and understand the nuances of different languages.\n\nOne of the key advantages of the xlm-v-base model is its ability to perform zero-shot learning. This means that the model can be directly applied to downstream tasks without any additional training or fine-tuning. For example, you can use the model for tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, or sentiment analysis by simply providing the input text and the task-specific prompts or templates.\n\nTo use the xlm-v-base model without fine-tuning, you can leverage its pre-trained weights and the knowledge it has acquired during the pre-training phase.

We specify the model name as \"facebook/xlm-v-base\".\n\nNext, we define an input text with a masked token represented by `[MASK]`. We tokenize the input text using the loaded tokenizer, which converts the text into a format suitable for the model.\n\nWe then pass the tokenized inputs to the model to predict the masked token. The model returns the logits, which represent the predicted probabilities for each token in the vocabulary. We select the token with the highest probability using `argmax` and decode it back into a string using the tokenizer.\n\nFinally, we print the predicted token, which should be \"Paris\" in this case.\n\nThis is just a simple example, but the facebook/xlm-v-base model can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks across multiple languages, making it a versatile choice for multilingual NLP applications."], "answer": ["XLM-V is multilingual language model with a one million token vocabulary trained on 2.5TB of data from Common Crawl (same as XLM-R).\nIt was introduced in the [XLM-V: Overcoming the Vocabulary Bottleneck in Multilingual Masked Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10472)\npaper by Davis Liang, Hila Gonen, Yuning Mao, Rui Hou, Naman Goyal, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Luke Zettlemoyer and Madian Khabsa.\n\nFrom the abstract of the XLM-V paper:", "capacity to achieve sufficient coverage for each individual language.

First, while scaling the vocabulary is an efficient form of conditional compute, it can result in increased pre-training times due to the computational complexity of the softmax over the entire vocabulary. We believe these issues can be solved by adopting approximation techniques like adaptive softmax (Joulin et al., 2017) and adaptive inputs (Baevski and Auli, 2018).

First, the authors train individual sentencepiece models for each language: for each language l in the set of languages L, a vocabulary V l is generated. Then, they create the shared lexicon V L by taking the union of each language-specific vocabulary, V L = \u222a l\u2208L V l . Next, for each language l, they construct a binary vector v l of dimension |V L | which represents the lexicon of l.

The tokenizer in \ud83e\udd17 Transformers\nshould output the same ids/subtokens as the `fairseq` tokenizer.\n\nFor this reason, the `xlm_v_tokenizer_comparison.py` script loads all 176 languages from the [WikiANN dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikiann),\ntokenizes each sentence and compares it.\n2. The final vocabulary For each resulting cluster, we train per-cluster sentencepiece models and combine the vocabularies of each cluster into a single multilingual vocabulary. The final vocabulary consists of 901,629 tokens (remaining 98,371 tokens overlapped between the 8 clusters), meaning that on average over 90% of the tokens learned in each cluster are unique.\n3. In this subsection, we describe our method for constructing multilingual vocabularies. At a high level, we (1) train individual monolingual sentencepiece models (SPM) for each language in our dataset using the Unigram Language Model (ULM) algorithm (Kudo and Richardson, 2018), (2) use the per-language vocabularies to construct lexical representation vectors for each language, (3) cluster the lexical representation vectors using K-Means, assign vocabulary capacities for each cluster using the ALP, and then\n4. The Unigram Language Model (ULM) from Kudo and Richardson (2018) is a popular subword segmentation algorithm used to construct vocabularies. ULM begins with a large initial vocabulary that is iteratively pruned to maximize the likelihood of the training corpus (under a unigram language model of the tokens) until the number of tokens falls below some pre-determined vocabulary size threshold, |V |. During tokenization, ULM decodes the most probable segmentation of a sequence through the Viterbi algorithm\n5. 174,504 fa, pa, sa, ka, ur, lo, my, ne, am, te, my, th, ta, ko, bn, ml, he, sd, as, hi, km, gu, kn, si, yi, mr, ps, or, xh, ar, ug c2 102,722 ja, zh-TW, zh-CN c3 186,881 fi, sk, om, sw, ln, az, lg, uz, so, hy, ss, hu, la, ff, et, ta, wo, lv, ku, te, sc, el, pl, lt su, jv, tl, sv, tn, no, id, ig, bn, ns, mg, cs, ms, ro, ur, rm, ha, ga, ht, is, eo, gd, br, hi, en, cy, fr, vi, da, yo, de, sq  train a language-specific sentencepiece model with a vocabulary size of 30,000 (per language) using this data.\n6. Their procedure for building a multilingual vocabulary contains several steps. First, the authors train individual sentencepiece models for each language: for each language l in the set of languages L, a vocabulary V l is generated. Then, they create the shared lexicon V L by taking the union of each language-specific vocabulary, V L = \u222a l\u2208L V l . Next, for each language l, they construct a binary vector v l of dimension |V L | which represents the lexicon of l. Each component of v l corresponds to a\n7. (Viterbi, 1967). This method is used by both XLM-R and our work. et al. (2020) proposed an approach to multilingual vocabulary construction that balances the trade-off between optimizing for cross-lingual subword sharing and the need for robust representation of individual languages.\n8. that our sentencepiece model reduces overtokenization and can be surprisingly good at splitting sentences into pseudo-meaningful segments out-of-the-box. Table 6: Average number of tokens after tokenization on the FLoRes-200 dataset for several high, medium, and low resource languages. AVG denotes the average tokenized lengths per sentence across all 200 languages in Flores-200. We see diminishing returns as the size of the vocabulary is increased beyond 1M tokens.\n9. capacity to achieve sufficient coverage for each individual language. Tokenizations using our vocabulary are typically more semantically meaningful and shorter compared to XLM-R. Leveraging this improved vocabulary, we train XLM-V, a multilingual language model with a one million token vocabulary. XLM-V outperforms XLM-R on every task we tested on ranging from natural language inference (XNLI), question answering (MLQA, XQuAD, TyDiQA), to named entity recognition (WikiAnn). XLM-V is particularly effective\n10. The XLM-R vocabulary is created using the same procedure from  by applying the ULM algorithm described in Section 2 on a corpus of 1B lines of text sampled from CC100. The result is a multilingual vocabulary with 250,002 tokens. For our experiments, we simply re-use the publicly available XLM-R sentencepiece model and pretrained model checkpoint from fairseq .\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide detail tokenization, resizing/rewriting (depending on the modality), etc. about the preprocessing for the data of the model facebook/xlm-v-base.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model facebook/xlm-v-base.

Increasing the vocabulary size can significantly increase pretraining time due to the computationally intensive softmax layer. To address this, prior works have leveraged approximation tricks such as adaptive softmax (Baevski and Auli, 2018) and adaptive inputs (Joulin et al., 2017). However, we found that these tricks require non-trivial amounts of tuning and resulted in slower convergence and increased training instability.

For XLM-R, which has a vocabulary size of 250K tokens, the vocabulary embedding matrix contains 77% of the model's trainable parameters. For XLM-V, the 1M token vocabulary accounts for 93% of the model's trainable parameters. While scaling the vocabulary can markedly increase the number of trainable parameters in a model, we can treat it as an efficient form of conditional compute (Bengio et al., 2015): only a small fraction of the embedding matrix is used for any given input. We illustrate the relationship\n4. and Conneau, 2019) for additional context.

In particular, we find that XLM-V consistently outperforms XLM-R on low-resource languages. For example, in Table 3, we observe a 4.7% and 2.9% accu-racy improvement on Swahili (sw) and Urdu (ur) on XNLI.

Representing input data with fewer tokens can speed up inference, allow the model to make use of longer context, and help with over-tokenization for low-resource languages (Rust et al., 2020). Table 6 shows the average number of resulting tokens (post-tokenization) for several languages in FLoRes-200. On average, the XLM-V tokenizer returns fewer tokens for high and medium resource languages while Chung et al. (2020) returns the fewest tokens for low-resource languages. Overall, XLM-V returns 11.5% fewer\n7. Table 5 shows a few tokenized examples from Chinese (zh), English (en), French (fr), Spanish (es), and German (de). For languages in the same cluster (en, fr, es), our method can separate shared roots (e.g. narco) from the same word in different languages. Notably, our method demonstrates a surprising ability to segment Chinese out-of-the-box, parsing out individual entities in the original phrase. For example, the XLM-V tokenizer is able to meaningfully break down the phrase \u5251 \u6865 \u5927 \u5b66 \u672c \u79d1 \u751f \u548c \u7814 \u7a76 \u751f,\n8. capacity to achieve sufficient coverage for each individual language. Tokenizations using our vocabulary are typically more semantically meaningful and shorter compared to XLM-R.

Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the XLM-V model (facebook/xlm-v-base), here are some foreseeable characteristics that may influence the model's behavior:\n\n1. Language coverage and resource availability: XLM-V is a multilingual model trained on a large corpus covering many languages. However, the performance may vary across high-resource, medium-resource, and low-resource languages due to differences in training data availability and quality. Evaluation should be disaggregated across languages to uncover potential disparities.\n\n2. Domain and context: The model's performance may be influenced by the domain and context of the input text. The references mention training on Common Crawl data and evaluation on tasks like natural language inference (XNLI), question answering (MLQA, XQuAD, TyDiQA), and named entity recognition (WikiAnn). Performance may vary across different domains and contexts not well-represented in the training data.\n\n3. Tokenization and vocabulary: XLM-V uses a large vocabulary of one million tokens, which can lead to more semantically meaningful and shorter tokenizations compared to models like XLM-R. This may impact the model's ability to handle longer contexts and out-of-vocabulary words, especially for low-resource languages.\n\n4. [More Information Needed] on specific population subgroups that may experience disparities in model performance, such as demographic groups based on age, gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.\n\n5. [More Information Needed] on potential biases or fairness concerns that may arise from the training data or model architecture.\n\nTo better understand the model's behavior and uncover potential disparities, it is important to conduct disaggregated evaluation across various factors such as language, domain, context, and relevant population subgroups. More information and analysis would be needed to fully characterize the model's performance and fairness."}

A lower perplexity indicates better performance.\n\n2. BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy): This is used for evaluating machine translation tasks. It compares the model's output to reference translations and calculates a score based on n-gram overlap.\n\n3. F1 Score: For tasks like named entity recognition or question answering, the F1 score is often used. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's accuracy.\n\n4. Accuracy: For classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis or natural language inference, accuracy is a straightforward metric that measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.\n\n5. Cross-lingual Transfer Performance: As XLM-V is a multilingual model, its performance can be evaluated on cross-lingual transfer tasks. This measures how well the model can transfer knowledge learned in one language to another language with limited or no training data.\n\nThe choice of evaluation metrics will depend on the specific downstream task and the goals of the evaluation process.

The model's performance can be evaluated based on several types of errors:\n\n1. Language-specific errors: The model may perform better on some languages compared to others, depending on the quality and quantity of training data available for each language. This can lead to higher error rates for underrepresented languages.\n\n2. Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) errors: The model may struggle with words or phrases that are not present in its training data, leading to higher error rates when encountering rare or domain-specific terms.\n\n3. Contextual errors: The model may sometimes fail to capture the correct context of a word or phrase, leading to misinterpretations or incorrect translations.\n\n4. Grammatical errors: Although the model is trained to understand and generate text in multiple languages, it may still make grammatical mistakes, especially when dealing with complex sentence structures or language-specific rules.\n\nThe tradeoff between these errors depends on the specific use case and the languages involved. For example, prioritizing the reduction of language-specific errors may come at the cost of increased OOV errors, as the model would need to focus on a smaller set of languages with more training data. Similarly, minimizing contextual errors may require sacrificing some performance on grammatical accuracy, as the model would need to focus more on capturing the overall meaning rather than adhering to strict grammatical rules.\n\nUltimately, the choice of which errors to prioritize depends on the application and the user's requirements. Fine-tuning the model on domain-specific data or using language-specific models can help mitigate some of these tradeoffs, but it's essential to understand the limitations and strengths of the XLM-V base model when deploying it in real-world scenarios."]}

As the field of natural language processing (NLP) continues to advance, there is a growing interest in understanding how these models work and what they have learned during the training process.\n\nExplainability and interpretability are crucial aspects of AI research, as they help developers and users understand the reasoning behind a model's predictions or outputs. In the case of the XLM-V model, researchers at Facebook and in the wider NLP community are beginning to explore methods to interpret and explain the model's behavior.\n\nSome potential areas of research in this domain include:\n\n1. Analyzing the model's attention mechanisms to understand which parts of the input text the model focuses on when making predictions.\n\n2. Visualizing the model's internal representations to gain insights into how it encodes and processes information from different languages.\n\n3. Conducting probing experiments to assess the model's understanding of various linguistic phenomena, such as syntax, semantics, and discourse.\n\n4.

The model uses a new approach for scaling to very large multilingual vocabularies by de-emphasizing token sharing between languages with little lexical overlap and assigning vocabulary capacity to achieve sufficient coverage for each individual language.\n\nThe model is pretrained using the Masked Language Model (MLM) task with the standard masking rate of 15%. The training details are as follows:\n\n- Optimizer: Adam with default (\u03b21, \u03b22) and \u03f5 parameters of (0.9, 0.98) and 1e-6, respectively\n- Learning rate: 6e-4\n- Warmup: 15,000 steps\n- Batch size: 8,192 distributed across 256 A100 GPUs\n- Training iterations: 1.5M\n- Maximum sequence length: 512\n\n[More Information Needed] (Specific model architecture details are not provided in the given references)\n\nThe objective of XLM-V is to overcome the vocabulary bottleneck in multilingual masked language models and improve the representational capabilities compared to models like XLM-R. XLM-V aims to provide more semantically meaningful and shorter tokenizations, especially for low-resource languages, leading to improved performance on various multilingual language understanding tasks."}
