This allows each stage to progressively reduce the number of tokens while increasing the width of the tokens, achieving spatial downsampling and increased richness of representation.\n2. Convolutional Projection: In the Convolutional Transformer Block, a depth-wise separable convolution operation, referred to as Convolutional Projection, is applied for query, key, and value embeddings. This replaces the original position-wise linear projection for Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA).\n\nThe CvT architecture employs a multi-stage hierarchy design borrowed from CNNs, with three stages in total. Each stage consists of the Convolutional Token Embedding followed by a stack of Convolutional Transformer Blocks.\n\nThe specific configuration for the microsoft/cvt-21-384-22k model is CvT-21, which has 31.54M parameters.\n\nModel Objective:\nThe objective of the CvT model is to achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks, such as ImageNet-1k, while having fewer parameters and lower FLOPs compared to other Vision Transformers and ResNets. The model aims to introduce the desirable properties of CNNs to the Vision Transformer architecture (i.e., shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (i.e., dynamic attention, global context, and better generalization).\n\nThe CvT-W24 model, when pretrained on the larger ImageNet-22k dataset and fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k, obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7% on the ImageNet-1k validation set.\n\n[More Information Needed] on the specific training details and hyperparameters used for the microsoft/cvt-21-384-22k model."
