    "answer": "Model Architecture:\nSwin Transformer V2 (SwinV2) is a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. SwinV2 introduces techniques to scale up the model capacity and window resolution, including res-post-norm and scaled cosine attention, as well as a log-spaced continuous relative position bias approach.\n\nTraining Procedures:\n[More Information Needed]\n\nParameters:\nThe SwinV2-L model is a large-capacity variant of Swin Transformer V2.\n\nImportant Disclaimers:\n- Larger models are more data hungry. SwinV2 exploits a self-supervised pre-training method, SimMIM, to alleviate the demands on labeled data.\n- If exceeding a certain model size, more labeled data, stronger regularization, or advanced self-supervised learning methods may be required for further performance gains.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- The model was pre-trained on ImageNet-22K and fine-tuned on ImageNet-1K.\n- It uses an input image size (window size) of 192\u00d7192 to 256x256 (12\u00d712 to 16x16).\n\nFor more detailed information on specific hyperparameters and training settings, please refer to the original paper or contact the model developers."

The goal is to leverage the power of large-scale pre-training and transfer learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream vision tasks.\n\n[More Information Needed] on the exact training hyperparameters, computational requirements, and evaluation metrics for this specific model variant."
