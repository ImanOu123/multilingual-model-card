    "answer": "Model Architecture:\nThe model consists of an image encoder and a text decoder in a transformer architecture. The image encoder is based on a contrastive pre-trained model that takes a raw image as input and outputs a compact 2D feature map, which is flattened and projected to D dimensions. The text is tokenized, embedded into D dimensions, and concatenated with the image features as input to the transformer module. The text is decoded auto-regressively until the [EOS] token or maximum steps are reached.\n\nTraining Procedures:\nThe model is pre-trained on large-scale image-text paired data with a language modeling objective to generate the associated text description given an input image. For fine-tuning on visual question answering tasks like TextVQA, the question and ground-truth answer are concatenated as a special caption, with the language modeling loss only applied to the answer and [EOS] tokens. The model learns to predict the answer in a generative manner without pre-defined candidate answers.\n\nParameters:\n[More Information Needed]\n\nImportant Disclaimers:\n- The model is a generative approach to visual question answering, which imposes more challenges compared to discriminative methods that use pre-defined answer candidates. Due to the difficulty of the generative task, the model may have slightly worse performance on some VQA benchmarks compared to discriminative approaches.\n- [More Information Needed]\n\nFor model card updates or further information, please contact the project organizer of the microsoft/git-base-textvqa development team."

More research is needed to control the output and mitigate potential harms before deploying the model in practice.\n- Some gender and skin tone biases were measured in the model's performance on COCO images, ranging from 0.7% to 5.3% normalized performance difference between groups (ref 4, 5). \n\nTechnical Limitations:\n- The base model's performance dropped with the largest 0.8B pre-training dataset on COCO, possibly because the model has limited capacity to effectively benefit from very large-scale noisy data (ref 1). Scaling the model size helps more.\n- Scaling up the text decoder size did not improve performance, possibly due to limited text data or the decoder's simpler language modeling task (ref 2, 6).

Bias and fairness: The model shows relatively low bias (0.7% to 5.3% NPD) across gender groups in the evaluation (Ref 3). However, more analysis may be needed to assess bias and fairness issues across other demographic groups and image types.\n\n2. Robustness to noisy data: The model's performance on COCO drops with 0.8B pre-training data compared to 14M, possibly because the 0.8B data is noisier and less similar to COCO (Ref 2). The model's robustness to noisy and out-of-domain data should be further evaluated and improved if needed.\n\n3. Limitations in text generation: The model shows difficulty in effectively scaling up the text decoder (Ref 1, 4). More research may be needed to enhance the model's language generation capabilities, especially for complex or less common text patterns.\n\n4. Responsible use and potential misuse: While the model shows impressive results in recognizing and describing a wide range of visual content (Ref 7), its capabilities could potentially be misused, e.g. for generating deceptive or harmful content. Responsible use guidelines and safeguards should be provided.\n\n5.

Performance may vary across these different VQA datasets.\n- The model uses a generative approach without pre-defined answer candidates, which poses more challenges compared to discriminative models.
