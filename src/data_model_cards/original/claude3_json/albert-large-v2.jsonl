    "answer": "Based on the provided references about the ALBERT model, here are some recommendations regarding foreseeable issues with the albert-large-v2 model:\n\n1. Computational cost: While ALBERT-xxlarge achieves better results with fewer parameters than BERT-large, it is still computationally expensive due to its larger structure. Methods like sparse attention and block attention should be explored to speed up training and inference.\n\n2. Diminishing returns with increased width: Increasing the hidden size of ALBERT-large configurations leads to performance gains but with diminishing returns. Going too wide (e.g. 6144 hidden size) may lead to a significant performance decline.\n\n3. [More Information Needed] on how the albert-large-v2 model specifically compares to the state-of-the-art results reported for ALBERT on GLUE, SQuAD 2.0, and RACE benchmarks. \n\n4. Additional representation power: While sentence order prediction (SOP) appears to be a more useful pre-training task than next sentence prediction (NSP), there may be additional self-supervised training losses not yet captured that could further improve the representations learned.\n\n5. Dropout and batch normalization: Evidence suggests combining dropout and batch normalization can hurt performance in large Transformer models like ALBERT. More experimentation is needed to confirm if this applies to albert-large-v2 as well.\n\n6. Memory limitations and model distillation: Given the importance of model size for performance, memory constraints of available hardware can be an obstacle. It's common to distill large pre-trained models down to smaller ones for real applications. [More Information Needed] on plans for distillation of albert-large-v2.\n\n7. Vocabulary size and embedding matrix: Natural language processing usually requires a large vocabulary size V. If the embedding dimension E is tied to the hidden size H, increasing H also significantly increases the size of the embedding matrix (V x E), resulting in a very large model.\n\nIn summary, key issues to consider are the computational cost, diminishing returns from increasing width, confirming state-of-the-art performance, exploring additional pre-training tasks, analyzing the effects of dropout, and handling memory constraints potentially through distillation. More information is needed in some areas to make specific recommendations for the albert-large-v2 model."

Some key aspects relevant to explainability and interpretability include:\n\n1. ALBERT uses a similar transformer encoder backbone as BERT, with GELU nonlinearities. The architecture hyperparameters like hidden size, number of layers, and attention heads follow certain ratios (e.g. feed-forward/filter size is 4H, attention heads is H/64).\n\n2. ALBERT introduces the sentence-order prediction (SOP) pre-training task which helps the model learn finer-grained distinctions about discourse-level coherence properties, compared to BERT's next sentence prediction (NSP) task. This could make ALBERT's representations more attuned to capturing coherence and potentially more interpretable in that regard.\n\n3.
