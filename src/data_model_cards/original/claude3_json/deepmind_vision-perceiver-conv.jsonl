    "answer": "Based on the provided references, here is the available information about the compute infrastructure used for the deepmind/vision-perceiver-conv model:\n\n- The experiments were conducted using JAX and the DeepMind JAX ecosystem.\n\n- The model training step time was measured on 64 TPUv3.\n\n[More Information Needed] on the specific details of:\n- Total compute used for training the model\n- Number of parameters in the model\n- Inference speed and hardware requirements\n\nThe references do not provide code blocks directly relevant to the compute infrastructure used. More details would be needed from the model developers to fully characterize the compute requirements and infrastructure."
