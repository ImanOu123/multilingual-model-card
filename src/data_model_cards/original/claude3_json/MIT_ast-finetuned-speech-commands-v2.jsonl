The model is pretrained on AudioSet and fine-tuned on the Speech Commands V2 dataset, achieving 98.12% accuracy on the evaluation set.\n\n2. It supports variable length input, so you can directly use it for your audio classification task, as long as your audio data is prepared in 16kHz.\n\n3. To use the pretrained model, you need to normalize the input audio to roughly 0 mean and 0.5 std. You can use the AudioSet normalization: \n```\ninput_spec = (input_spec + 4.26) / (4.57 * 2)\n```\n\n4. We provide a one-click, self-contained Google Colab script for AST inference and attention visualization. You can test the model with your own audio by clicking the \"Open in Colab\" badge:\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YuanGongND/ast/blob/master/colab/AST_Inference_Demo.ipynb)\n\n5.

    "answer": "The MIT/ast-finetuned-speech-commands-v2 model can be used for speech command recognition tasks when fine-tuned. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.1% on the Speech Commands V2 dataset.\n\nTo use the fine-tuned model in your own training pipeline, you can take the `ast/src/models/ast_models.py` file, set `audioset_pretrain=True`, and integrate it with your pipeline. Make sure to normalize the audio input to roughly 0 mean and 0.5 std, similar to what the pretrained model expects. You can use the AudioSet normalization: \n\n```python\ninput_spec = (input_spec + 4.26) / (4.57 * 2)\n```\n\nNote that AST requires a smaller learning rate (10x smaller than CNN models) and converges faster, so tune the learning rate and scheduler appropriately for your task.\n\nThe model supports variable length inputs, so it can be applied to different speech tasks without architecture changes. In an application, you would feed 16kHz audio (that the model was trained on) and get the predicted speech command as output.\n\n[More Information Needed] for providing a complete code snippet, as the references don't include one.

Applying it to significantly different audio classification tasks may lead to unreliable or biased results.\n\nUsers should not assume the model will perform optimally on speech data of lengths differing from what it was trained on (around 1 second clips). Feeding much longer or shorter audio could degrade accuracy.\n\nThe model should not be deployed in high-stakes real-world scenarios like voice-controlled medical devices or emergency response systems without thorough testing and validation, as errors could have severe consequences. \n\nUsers ought not extrapolate the model's strong benchmark performance to claim human-level accuracy in understanding speech commands, as the model's robustness to accents, noise, and adversarial attacks is [More Information Needed].\n\nTo mitigate potential misuse, the model card should clearly state the intended use case of simple speech command recognition, emphasize that predictions are probabilistic and can be erroneous, and caution against application in sensitive domains without extensive testing on representative real-world data.\n\n[More Information Needed] on details of the model architecture, training data, and evaluation of fairness and robustness that would allow deeper analysis of misuse potential and recommendations for mitigation."

Applying it outside its intended use case could lead to poor performance or misclassifications.\n- [More Information Needed] on potential biases in the training data that could lead to unfair or discriminatory model outputs.\n\nTechnical limitations: \n- The model expects 16kHz audio input that is roughly normalized to 0 mean and 0.5 std (ref 4). Using audio that deviates significantly from this could degrade performance.\n- A fixed AST architecture is used which may not be optimal for all speech classification tasks (ref 10).\n- [More Information Needed] on compute requirements and latency which could limit real-time applications.\n\nSociotechnical limitations:\n- As a speech classifier, the model has no contextual understanding.
