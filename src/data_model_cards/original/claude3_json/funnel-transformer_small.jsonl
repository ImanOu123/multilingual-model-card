For tasks requiring fine-grained token-level analysis, a different model may be more appropriate.\n\nUsers should be cautious about applying Funnel-Transformer to sensitive tasks like hate speech detection or misinformation identification without thorough testing, as the sequence compression could potentially lose important details. Responsible testing and monitoring for unintended biases or blind spots is advised.\n\n[More Information Needed] on specific risks if Funnel-Transformer is applied to domains outside NLP like time series and video stream analysis, as alluded to in Reference 1. More research is needed on Funnel-Transformer's suitability and failure modes in those areas.\n\nThe ability to inject additional decoder input to control attention, mentioned in Reference 2, should be used judiciously.
