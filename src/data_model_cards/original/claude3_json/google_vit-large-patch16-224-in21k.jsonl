Self-supervised pre-training: Although self-supervised pre-training improves the model's performance, there is still a significant gap compared to large-scale supervised pre-training.

References 1, 2, and 5 indicate that ViT models benefit from larger datasets like ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M compared to smaller datasets like ImageNet. The model's performance on downstream tasks will likely vary depending on the similarity between the pre-training data domain and the target domain.\n\nComputational Cost and Model Size: \nReferences 4 and 7 suggest that the computational cost of pre-training and the model size impact ViT's performance. Larger ViT models tend to perform better but require more compute resources for pre-training. The ViT-L/16 model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k shows good performance while being more computationally efficient.\n\nFine-tuning Resolution:\nReference 3 mentions that fine-tuning ViT at a higher resolution than the pre-training resolution can be beneficial. The patch size remains the same, resulting in a larger effective sequence length. This suggests that the model's performance may vary based on the resolution used during fine-tuning.\n\n[More Information Needed] regarding specific population subgroups or factors for disaggregated evaluation, as the provided references do not cover this aspect in detail.\n\nIn summary, the pre-training dataset size and domain, computational cost, model size, and fine-tuning resolution are key characteristics that influence the behavior of the google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model.

    "answer": "Based on the provided references, here are some key points about the interpretability and explainability of the google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model:\n\n1. Self-attention allows the model to integrate information globally across the entire image, even in the lowest layers. The \"attention distance\" (analogous to receptive field size in CNNs) varies across attention heads, with some attending to most of the image while others focus on smaller regions. As depth increases, the attention distance increases for all heads.\n\n2. The model learns to encode distance within the image in the similarity of position embeddings. Patches that are closer together tend to have more similar position embeddings, and there is a row-column structure where patches in the same row/column have similar embeddings.\n\n3.

A classification head (MLP with one hidden layer during pre-training, single linear layer during fine-tuning) is attached to this image representation for classification tasks.\n\nModel Objective:\nThe Vision Transformer model is typically pre-trained on large datasets and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. During pre-training, the model learns to capture general image features, while during fine-tuning, it adapts to specific tasks such as image classification. The model has shown excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks when pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks, while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.\n\n[More Information Needed] on specific pre-training and fine-tuning details for the google/vit-large-patch16-224-in21k model."
