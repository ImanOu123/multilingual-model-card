Using biased data for pre-training could lead to an unfair or biased model.\n\n- ConvNeXt achieves strong performance with its large model variants, but training and using these huge models requires enormous computing resources and can result in increased carbon emissions. Users should consider if such large models are truly necessary for their use case and strive for simplicity and efficiency when possible. \n\n- While ConvNeXt shows promising robustness on some benchmarks, its robustness and fairness still needs further investigation, especially compared to Transformers. Users should not assume ConvNeXt will be robust and fair in all scenarios without proper testing.\n\n- ConvNeXt may be well-suited for certain computer vision tasks, but not necessarily all.
