Key components include:\n\n- Normalization layers and activations: Each convolution is followed by batch normalization. \n- Patch embedding: A small convnet is applied on input to the transformer stack.\n- No classification token: Average pooling on the last activation map produces an embedding used in the classifier.\n- Downsampling: Between LeViT stages, a shrinking attention block reduces activation map size.\n\nTraining Procedure:\nLeViT is trained with distillation driven training similar to DeiT, using two classification heads with cross-entropy loss. The first head receives supervision from groundtruth classes, the second from a RegNetY-16GF model trained on ImageNet. \n\nTo train LeViT-256 on ImageNet with hard distillation on 8 GPUs:\n\n```\npython -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env main.py --model LeViT_256 --data-path /path/to/imagenet --output_dir /path/to/save\n```\n\n[More Information Needed] on specific training details for the LeViT-128S variant.\n\nModel Parameters:\n[More Information Needed]\n\nImportant Disclaimers:\n[More Information Needed]\n\nFor more details or questions, please contact the model development team at [More Information Needed]."
