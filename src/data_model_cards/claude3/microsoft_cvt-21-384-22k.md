## Training Details

### Training Data

The model microsoft/cvt-21-384-22k is pre-trained on the ImageNet-22k dataset, which contains 14.2 million images across 22k classes. The model is then fine-tuned on the ImageNet-1k dataset to obtain a top-1 accuracy of 84.9% on the ImageNet-1k validation set at 384x384 resolution.

To prepare the ImageNet dataset for training, the following folder structure should be used:

```sh

```

[More Information Needed] on any additional data pre-processing or filtering steps used.

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing

Here are the details about the preprocessing for the data of the model microsoft/cvt-21-384-22k:

Resizing:
The input images are resized to a resolution of 384x384 pixels, as indicated by the model name "cvt-21-384-22k".

Tokenization:
The model uses a Convolutional Token Embedding layer to convert the input image into a sequence of tokens. This layer adjusts the token feature dimension and the number of tokens at each stage by varying parameters of the convolution operation. The specific details are:

``` sh
1. x q/k/v i = Flatten (Conv2d (Reshape2D(x i ), s)) ,(2)
where x q/k/v i is the token input for Q/K/V matrices at layer i, x i is the unperturbed token prior to the Convolutional Projection, Conv2d is a depth-wise separable convolution [5] implemented by: Depth-wise Conv2d → BatchNorm2d → Point-wise Conv2d, and s refers to the convolution kernel size.
```

The convolution operation in the Convolutional Token Embedding layer aims to model local spatial contexts, from low-level edges to higher order semantic primitives, over a multi-stage hierarchy approach, similar to CNNs.

Data Preparation:
The training data should be prepared in the following format:

``` sh
|-DATASET
  |-imagenet
    |-train
    | |-class1
    | | |-img1.jpg
    | | |-img2.jpg
    | | |-...
    | |-class2
    | | |-img3.jpg

    | |-class3
    | | |-img4.jpg
    | | |-...
    | |-...
    |-val
      |-class1
      | |-img5.jpg
      | |-...
      |-class2
      | |-img6.jpg
      | |-...
      |-class3

## Model Examination

Here is my attempt at answering the question about explainability/interpretability for the microsoft/cvt-21-384-22k model based on the provided references:

The CvT (Convolutional vision Transformer) architecture introduced in this model enables better interpretability compared to standard Vision Transformers in a few key ways:

1. By replacing position-wise linear projections with convolutional projections and using a Convolutional Token Embedding, the model can capture local spatial relationships without relying on positional embeddings. This simplifies the architecture and makes the learned features more spatially grounded and interpretable. [Reference 1, 2, 3]

2. Incorporating a pyramid structure with convolutions allows the model to learn multi-scale feature maps, similar to CNNs. Fusing local neighborhood information through the convolutions is important for performance and interpretability of the learned representations. [Reference 4]  

3. [More Information Needed] on specific explainability/interpretability analysis or visualizations of the learned features and attentions in the CvT-21 model. The references do not appear to include examples of this.

4. [More Information Needed] on how the design choices and performance of CvT-21 on downstream tasks may relate to its explainability/interpretability properties compared to other vision transformer models like ViT. More direct comparisons would help characterize the benefits of the CvT architecture.

In summary, the convolutional design elements in CvT-21 take inspiration from CNNs to make the learned visual features more locally grounded and multi-scale compared to ViT. However, more specific interpretability analysis of the model is needed to make strong claims. The provided references focus more on the architecture design and performance rather than explainability.

## Technical Specification

### Model Architecture and Objective

Model Architecture:
The Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) architecture introduces two convolution-based operations into the Vision Transformer architecture:
1. Convolutional Token Embedding: The input image (or 2D reshaped token maps) are subjected to the Convolutional Token Embedding layer, which is implemented as a convolution with overlapping patches with tokens reshaped to the 2D spatial grid. This allows each stage to progressively reduce the number of tokens while increasing the width of the tokens, achieving spatial downsampling and increased richness of representation.
2. Convolutional Projection: In the Convolutional Transformer Block, a depth-wise separable convolution operation, referred to as Convolutional Projection, is applied for query, key, and value embeddings. This replaces the original position-wise linear projection for Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA).

The CvT architecture employs a multi-stage hierarchy design borrowed from CNNs, with three stages in total. Each stage consists of the Convolutional Token Embedding followed by a stack of Convolutional Transformer Blocks.

The specific configuration for the microsoft/cvt-21-384-22k model is CvT-21, which has 31.54M parameters.

Model Objective:
The objective of the CvT model is to achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks, such as ImageNet-1k, while having fewer parameters and lower FLOPs compared to other Vision Transformers and ResNets. The model aims to introduce the desirable properties of CNNs to the Vision Transformer architecture (i.e., shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (i.e., dynamic attention, global context, and better generalization).

The CvT-W24 model, when pretrained on the larger ImageNet-22k dataset and fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k, obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7% on the ImageNet-1k validation set.
