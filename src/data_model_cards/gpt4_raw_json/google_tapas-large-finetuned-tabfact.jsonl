This model is fine-tuned on the TabFact dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 16,000 Wikipedia tables for binary classification (entailment and refutation) of table-related statements.\n\nThe TAPAS model incorporates BERT's transformer architecture, which uses self-attention mechanisms to process input data. However, TAPAS modifies the input representation to encode tabular data effectively. It treats the rows and columns of a table as if they were sentences, allowing the model to understand the relationships between different cells and between the cells and the table structure.\n\nThe \"large\" in `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` indicates the size of the model, which has more layers and parameters compared to its smaller counterparts, such as \"base\" or \"small\" models. Specifically, the \"large\" model typically has 24 transformer layers, 1024 hidden units per layer, and 16 attention heads, resulting in a total of over 340 million parameters.\n\nThe fine-tuning process on the TabFact dataset adapts the pre-trained TAPAS model to the specific task of verifying factual correctness of statements based on table data.

TAPAS is an extension of the BERT architecture that has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text and structured tables from Wikipedia. The model is designed to understand table structure, perform cell selection, and answer questions based on tabular data.\n\nFor the fine-tuning process on the TabFact dataset, which is a large-scale dataset with over 16,000 Wikipedia tables and 118,000 manually annotated statements labeled as either ENTAILMENT or REFUTATION, the following steps are typically involved:\n\n1. **Pre-training**: Before fine-tuning, TAPAS models are pre-trained on the masked language modeling (MLM) task, where random words in the input are masked, and the model learns to predict them. This pre-training also includes a novel pre-training objective that involves predicting whether cells in a table are masked based on the surrounding context.\n\n2. **Fine-tuning**: The pre-trained TAPAS model is then fine-tuned on the TabFact dataset. During fine-tuning, the model is trained to classify the veracity of a statement as either supporting or refuting the information in a given table. The input to the model includes the statement and the relevant table, and the output is a binary classification.\n\n3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: During fine-tuning, hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs are adjusted to optimize performance on the TabFact dataset.\n\n4. **Regularization Techniques**: Techniques such as dropout and weight decay may be employed to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.\n\n5. **Evaluation**: The fine-tuned model is evaluated on a held-out validation set from the TabFact dataset to measure its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to assess how well the model can verify factual statements against the tables.\n\n6. **Post-processing**: After fine-tuning, additional post-processing steps might be applied, such as threshold adjustments for the classification task, to further refine the model's predictions.\n\nThe `tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` model leverages the large size of the TAPAS architecture, which allows it to capture more complex patterns and relationships in the data, potentially leading to better performance on the fact verification task compared to smaller variants of the model.", "The model `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` is a variant of the TAPAS (Tabular Parsers) model, which is specifically fine-tuned for the task of table-based fact verification.

Users should be cautious when applying the model to sensitive or out-of-distribution data.\n\n2. **Interpretability**: While the model can provide answers based on tabular data, the reasoning process of neural networks is not always transparent. Users should not solely rely on the model's output without further verification, especially in critical applications.\n\n3. **Bias and Fairness**: Like any machine learning model, TAPAS may inherit biases present in the training data. Users should be aware of potential biases in the answers and consider them when interpreting the results.\n\n4. **Performance Expectations**: The model's accuracy is dependent on the complexity of the question and the structure of the table.

TAPAS is an extension of the BERT architecture that has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text and structured tables from Wikipedia. The model is designed to understand table structure, perform cell selection, and answer questions based on tabular data.\n\nFor the fine-tuning process on the TabFact dataset, which is a large-scale dataset with over 16,000 Wikipedia tables and 118,000 manually annotated statements labeled as either ENTAILMENT or REFUTATION, the following steps are typically involved:\n\n1. **Pre-training**: Before fine-tuning, TAPAS models are pre-trained on the masked language modeling (MLM) task, where random words in the input are masked, and the model learns to predict them. This pre-training also includes a novel pre-training objective that involves predicting whether cells in a table are masked based on the surrounding context.\n\n2. **Fine-tuning**: The pre-trained TAPAS model is then fine-tuned on the TabFact dataset. During fine-tuning, the model is trained to classify the veracity of a statement as either supporting or refuting the information in a given table.

We use a model architecture derived from BERT and add additional embeddings to encode the table structure, following the approach of Herzig et al. (2020) to encode the input.\nThe statement and table in a pair are tokenized into word pieces and concatenated using the standard [CLS] and [SEP] tokens in between. The table is flattened row by row and no additional separator is added between the cells or rows. 1 Based on table 2-14611590-3.html with light edits.\n2. Six types of learnable input embeddings are added together as shown in Appendix B. Token embeddings, position embeddings and segment embeddings are analogous to the ones used in standard BERT. Additionally we follow Herzig et al. (2020) and use column and row embeddings which encode the two dimensional position of the cell that the token corresponds to and rank embeddings for numeric columns that encode the numeric rank of the cell with respect to the column, and provide a simple way for the model to know\n3. Recall that the bi-directional self-attention mechanism in transformers is unaware of order, which motivates the usage of positional and segment embeddings for text in BERT, and generalizes naturally to column and row embeddings when processing tables, in the 2-dimensional case.\n4. Let s and T represent the sentence and table respectively and E s and E T be their corresponding input embeddings. The sequence (Vaswani et al., 2017) denoted f and a contextual representation is obtained for every token. We model the probability of entailment P (s|T ) with a single hidden layer neural network computed from the output of the [CLS] token:\nE = [E [CLS] ; E s ; E [SEP] ; E T ] is passed through a transformer\nP (s|T ) = MLP f [CLS] (E)\n5. We provide pre-trained models for different model sizes.\n\nThe metrics are computed by our tool and not the official metrics of the\nrespective tasks. We provide them so one can verify whether one's own runs\nare in the right ballpark. They are medians over three individual runs.\n6. In all experiments, we start with the public TAPAS checkpoint, 6 train an entailment model on the data from Section 3 and then fine-tune on the end task (TABFACT or SQA). We report the median accuracy values over 3 pre-training and 3 fine-tuning runs (9 runs in total). We estimate the error margin as half the interquartile range, that is half the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The hyper-parameters, how we chose them, hardware and other information to reproduce our experiments are\n7. We discuss two methods to create pre-training data that lead to stronger table entailment models. Both methods create statements for existing Wikipedia tables 2 . We extract all tables that have at least two columns, a header row and two data rows. We recursively split tables row-wise into the upper and lower half until they have at most 50 cells. This way we obtain 3.7 million tables.\n8. ```bash\npython3 tapas/run_task_main.py \\\n  --task=\"SQA\" \\\n  --output_dir=\"${output_dir}\" \\\n  --init_checkpoint=\"${tapas_data_dir}/model.ckpt\" \\\n  --bert_config_file=\"${tapas_data_dir}/bert_config.json\" \\\n  --mode=\"train\" \\\n  --use_tpu\n```\n\nThis will use the preset hyper-parameters set in `hparam_utils.py`.\n9. * Released code & models to run TAPAS on [TabFact](https://tabfact.github.io/) for table entailment, companion for the EMNLP 2020 Findings paper [Understanding tables with intermediate pre-training](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.27/).\n * Added a [colab](http://tiny.cc/tapas-tabfact-colab) to try predictions on TabFact\n * Added [new page](https://github.com/google-research/tapas/blob/master/INTERMEDIATE_PRETRAIN_DATA.md) describing the intermediate pre-training process.\n10.

The tables are processed to ensure they do not exceed 50 cells. During fine-tuning, the model is specifically trained on the TABFACT dataset. The training involves three pre-training and three fine-tuning runs, making a total of nine runs.

A recent example is TABFACT , a dataset of statements that are either entailed or refuted by tables from Wikipedia (Figure 1). Because solving these entailment problems requires sophisticated reasoning and higher-order operations like arg max, averaging, or comparing, human accuracy remains substantially (18 points) ahead of the best models (Zhong et al., 2020).\n2. We use a model architecture derived from BERT and add additional embeddings to encode the table structure, following the approach of Herzig et al. (2020) to encode the input.\nThe statement and table in a pair are tokenized into word pieces and concatenated using the standard [CLS] and [SEP] tokens in between. The table is flattened row by row and no additional separator is added between the cells or rows. 1 Based on table 2-14611590-3.html with light edits.\n3. The current models are dominated by semantic parsing approaches that attempt to create logical forms from weak supervision. We, on the other hand, follow Herzig et al. (2020) and  and encode the tables with BERT-based models to directly predict the entailment decision. But while BERT models for text have been scrutinized and optimized for how to best pre-train and represent textual data, the same attention has not been applied to tabular data, limiting the effectiveness in this setting. This paper\n4. iii) Using the pre-training tasks, we set the new state-of-the-art on TABFACT out-performing previous models by 6 points when using a BERT-base model and 9 points for a BERT-large model.

We provide them so one can verify whether one's own runs\nare in the right ballpark.

Another tool to run experiments is ```tapas_classifier_experiment.py```. It's more\nflexible than ```run_task_main.py``` but also requires setting all the hyper-parameters\n(via the respective command line flags).\n5. It's recommended to start a separate eval job to continuously produce predictions\nfor the checkpoints created by the training job. Alternatively, you can run\nthe eval job after training to only get the final results.\n\n```bash\npython3 tapas/run_task_main.py \\\n  --task=\"SQA\" \\\n  --output_dir=\"${output_dir}\" \\\n  --init_checkpoint=\"${tapas_data_dir}/model.ckpt\" \\\n  --bert_config_file=\"${tapas_data_dir}/bert_config.json\" \\\n  --mode=\"predict_and_evaluate\"\n```\n6. * Released code & models to run TAPAS on [TabFact](https://tabfact.github.io/) for table entailment, companion for the EMNLP 2020 Findings paper [Understanding tables with intermediate pre-training](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.27/).\n * Added a [colab](http://tiny.cc/tapas-tabfact-colab) to try predictions on TabFact\n * Added [new page](https://github.com/google-research/tapas/blob/master/INTERMEDIATE_PRETRAIN_DATA.md) describing the intermediate pre-training process.\n7. * TAPAS is added to [huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) in version 4.1.1. 28 checkpoints are added to the [huggingface model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=tapas) and can be played with using a [custom table question answering widget](https://huggingface.co/google/tapas-base-finetuned-wtq).\n8.

Integrating this model into a larger ecosystem or application can enhance the system's ability to automatically verify, search, and interact with structured data. Here's how it can be plugged into different systems:\n\n**Data Analysis Tools:**\nIncorporate the model into data analysis software or business intelligence tools to provide an additional layer of data validation. Users can query the system with natural language statements, and the model can verify the accuracy of these statements by cross-referencing the data in tables.\n\n**Educational Platforms:**\nEducational websites and e-learning platforms can use the model to create interactive learning experiences. Students can make claims based on tabular data provided in the course material, and the model can check the validity of their claims, offering immediate feedback.\n\n**Fact-Checking Websites:**\nFor platforms dedicated to fact-checking, the model can serve as an automated first step in the verification process. When claims are made that reference statistical data, the model can quickly assess the truthfulness of these claims against relevant datasets.\n\n**Search Engines:**\nIntegrate the model into search engine technology to improve the accuracy of search results that involve structured data. The model can help in understanding the context of user queries and provide answers that are factually consistent with the data available in indexed tables.\n\n**Voice Assistants and Chatbots:**\nVoice-activated assistants and chatbots can use the model to answer user queries that involve facts and figures. By connecting to databases with tabular data, the model can provide precise answers that are grounded in verified data.\n\n**Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems:**\nIncorporate the model into ERP systems to enable natural language querying of business data. Users can ask questions about sales figures, inventory levels, or financial reports, and the model can validate the information based on the data stored in the system's tables.\n\n**Customer Support Services:**\nCustomer support can be enhanced by using the model to provide accurate information based on FAQs or knowledge bases structured in tables. This can help in automating responses and providing consistent information to customers.\n\nTo integrate the model into an application, developers would typically use an API that allows the application to send queries to the model and receive responses. The application would need to preprocess the data into a format that the model can understand (i.e., tabular format) and post-process the model's output to present it in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, the integration may require setting up the necessary infrastructure to host the model, manage its performance, and ensure it scales with the application's usage.", "Certainly! The model `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` is a variant of the TAPAS (TAble PArSing) model, which is fine-tuned for the task of table-based fact verification. It is designed to understand table structure and draw conclusions from tabular data.\n\nHere's an example code snippet using the Hugging Face Transformers library to use this model for verifying a statement against a table:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import TapasForSequenceClassification, TapasTokenizer\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the TAPAS model fine-tuned on TabFact\nmodel_name = \"google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact\"\nmodel = TapasForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)\ntokenizer = TapasTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\n# Prepare the data (example table)\ndata = {\n    \"City\": [\"Amsterdam\", \"Berlin\", \"Paris\"],\n    \"Country\": [\"Netherlands\", \"Germany\", \"France\"],\n    \"Population\": [\"821752\", \"3562166\", \"2140526\"]\n}\ntable = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data)\n\n# Statement to verify\nquery = \"Berlin is the capital of Germany.\"\n\n# Tokenize the input\ninputs = tokenizer(table=table, queries=query, padding='max_length', return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Get the model's prediction\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# Process the prediction\npredicted_label = outputs.logits.argmax(dim=-1).item()\n\n# Convert the predicted label to a verdict\nverdict = \"REFUTES\" if predicted_label == 0 else \"ENTAILS\"\n\nprint(f\"The statement '{query}' {verdict} the information in the table.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we first import the necessary classes from the `transformers` library. We then load the `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` model and its corresponding tokenizer. We create a sample table using a pandas DataFrame and define a statement that we want to verify against the table.\n\nWe tokenize the input using the TAPAS tokenizer, which prepares the data in the format expected by the model. We then pass the tokenized input to the model to get the logits, which represent the model's confidence in refuting or entailing the statement. We take the argmax of the logits to get the predicted label and convert it to a human-readable verdict.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the `transformers` and `pandas` libraries installed to run this code. You can install them using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install transformers pandas\n```\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the model expects the table data to be in a specific format and the statement to be relevant to the table's content for accurate verification."]}

Make any necessary adjustments to the model or the fine-tuning process based on this evaluation.\n\n6. **Testing**: Once the model performs satisfactorily on the validation set, test it on the unseen test set to measure its generalization capabilities and ensure that it has not overfitted to the training data.\n\n7. **Deployment**: After successful fine-tuning and testing, the model can be deployed for the specific task, where it can be used to make predictions or analyze new tabular data in the context of the task it was fine-tuned for.\n\nIt's important to note that fine-tuning a model like `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` requires a good understanding of the model architecture, the task at hand, and machine learning principles to ensure that the model not only learns the specifics of the task but also generalizes well to new, unseen data.", "The model `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` is a specialized version of the TAPAS (Tabular Parser) model, which is fine-tuned for the task of fact-checking statements against tabular data. Integrating this model into a larger ecosystem or application can enhance the system's ability to automatically verify, search, and interact with structured data. Here's how it can be plugged into different systems:\n\n**Data Analysis Tools:**\nIncorporate the model into data analysis software or business intelligence tools to provide an additional layer of data validation. Users can query the system with natural language statements, and the model can verify the accuracy of these statements by cross-referencing the data in tables.\n\n**Educational Platforms:**\nEducational websites and e-learning platforms can use the model to create interactive learning experiences. Students can make claims based on tabular data provided in the course material, and the model can check the validity of their claims, offering immediate feedback.\n\n**Fact-Checking Websites:**\nFor platforms dedicated to fact-checking, the model can serve as an automated first step in the verification process. When claims are made that reference statistical data, the model can quickly assess the truthfulness of these claims against relevant datasets.\n\n**Search Engines:**\nIntegrate the model into search engine technology to improve the accuracy of search results that involve structured data. The model can help in understanding the context of user queries and provide answers that are factually consistent with the data available in indexed tables.\n\n**Voice Assistants and Chatbots:**\nVoice-activated assistants and chatbots can use the model to answer user queries that involve facts and figures. By connecting to databases with tabular data, the model can provide precise answers that are grounded in verified data.\n\n**Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems:**\nIncorporate the model into ERP systems to enable natural language querying of business data. Users can ask questions about sales figures, inventory levels, or financial reports, and the model can validate the information based on the data stored in the system's tables.\n\n**Customer Support Services:**\nCustomer support can be enhanced by using the model to provide accurate information based on FAQs or knowledge bases structured in tables. This can help in automating responses and providing consistent information to customers.\n\nTo integrate the model into an application, developers would typically use an API that allows the application to send queries to the model and receive responses. The application would need to preprocess the data into a format that the model can understand (i.e., tabular format) and post-process the model's output to present it in a user-friendly manner. Additionally, the integration may require setting up the necessary infrastructure to host the model, manage its performance, and ensure it scales with the application's usage.", "Certainly! The model `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` is a variant of the TAPAS (TAble PArSing) model, which is fine-tuned for the task of table-based fact verification. It is designed to understand table structure and draw conclusions from tabular data.\n\nHere's an example code snippet using the Hugging Face Transformers library to use this model for verifying a statement against a table:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import TapasForSequenceClassification, TapasTokenizer\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the TAPAS model fine-tuned on TabFact\nmodel_name = \"google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact\"\nmodel = TapasForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)\ntokenizer = TapasTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\n# Prepare the data (example table)\ndata = {\n    \"City\": [\"Amsterdam\", \"Berlin\", \"Paris\"],\n    \"Country\": [\"Netherlands\", \"Germany\", \"France\"],\n    \"Population\": [\"821752\", \"3562166\", \"2140526\"]\n}\ntable = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data)\n\n# Statement to verify\nquery = \"Berlin is the capital of Germany.\"\n\n# Tokenize the input\ninputs = tokenizer(table=table, queries=query, padding='max_length', return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Get the model's prediction\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# Process the prediction\npredicted_label = outputs.logits.argmax(dim=-1).item()\n\n# Convert the predicted label to a verdict\nverdict = \"REFUTES\" if predicted_label == 0 else \"ENTAILS\"\n\nprint(f\"The statement '{query}' {verdict} the information in the table.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we first import the necessary classes from the `transformers` library. We then load the `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` model and its corresponding tokenizer. We create a sample table using a pandas DataFrame and define a statement that we want to verify against the table.\n\nWe tokenize the input using the TAPAS tokenizer, which prepares the data in the format expected by the model. We then pass the tokenized input to the model to get the logits, which represent the model's confidence in refuting or entailing the statement. We take the argmax of the logits to get the predicted label and convert it to a human-readable verdict.\n\nPlease note that you need to have the `transformers` and `pandas` libraries installed to run this code. You can install them using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install transformers pandas\n```\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the model expects the table data to be in a specific format and the statement to be relevant to the table's content for accurate verification."], "answer": ["In all experiments, we start with the public TAPAS checkpoint, 6 train an entailment model on the data from Section 3 and then fine-tune on the end task (TABFACT or SQA).

Similarly we try to improve the discrete and numeric reasoning capabilities of the model.", "A recent example is TABFACT , a dataset of statements that are either entailed or refuted by tables from Wikipedia (Figure 1). Because solving these entailment problems requires sophisticated reasoning and higher-order operations like arg max, averaging, or comparing, human accuracy remains substantially (18 points) ahead of the best models (Zhong et al., 2020).", "Entailment tasks Recognizing entailment has a long history in NLP (Dagan et al., 2010). Recently, the text to text framework has been expanded to incorporate structured data, like knowledge graphs (Vlachos and Riedel, 2015), tables (Jo et al., 2019; or images (Suhr et al., 2017(Suhr et al., , 2019.

We evaluate table pruning techniques as a pre-processing step to select relevant columns that respect the input example length limits. As described in section 2, an example is built by concatenating the statement with the flattened table. For large tables the example length can exceed the capacity limit of the transformer.", "We introduced two pre-training tasks, counterfactual and synthetic, to obtain state-of-the-art results on the TABFACT  entailment task on tabular data. We adapted the BERT-based architecture of TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020) to binary classification and showed that pre-training on both tasks yields substantial improvements on TAB-FACT but also on a QA dataset, SQA (Iyyer et al., 2017), even with only a subset of the training data."]}

The hyper-parameters are optimized using a black box Bayesian optimizer similar to Google Vizier (Golovin et al., 2017) which looked at validation accuracy after 8, 000 steps only, in order to prevent over-fitting and use resources effectively. The ranges used were a learning rate from 10 \u22126 to 3 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , dropout probabilities from 0 to 0.2 and warm-up ratio from 0 to 0.05. We used 200 runs and kept the median values for the top 20 trials.\n2. ```bash\npython3 tapas/run_task_main.py \\\n  --task=\"SQA\" \\\n  --output_dir=\"${output_dir}\" \\\n  --init_checkpoint=\"${tapas_data_dir}/model.ckpt\" \\\n  --bert_config_file=\"${tapas_data_dir}/bert_config.json\" \\\n  --mode=\"train\" \\\n  --use_tpu\n```\n\nThis will use the preset hyper-parameters set in `hparam_utils.py`.\n3. The use of challenging pre-training tasks has been successful in improving downstream accuracy (Clark et al., 2020). One clear caveat of the method adopted in Herzig et al. (2020) which attempts to fill in the blanks of sentences and cells in the table is that not much understanding of the table in relation with the sentence is needed.\n4. It's recommended to start a separate eval job to continuously produce predictions\nfor the checkpoints created by the training job. Alternatively, you can run\nthe eval job after training to only get the final results.\n\n```bash\npython3 tapas/run_task_main.py \\\n  --task=\"SQA\" \\\n  --output_dir=\"${output_dir}\" \\\n  --init_checkpoint=\"${tapas_data_dir}/model.ckpt\" \\\n  --bert_config_file=\"${tapas_data_dir}/bert_config.json\" \\\n  --mode=\"predict_and_evaluate\"\n```\n5.

It's more\nflexible than ```run_task_main.py``` but also requires setting all the hyper-parameters\n(via the respective command line flags).\n6. We use a model architecture derived from BERT and add additional embeddings to encode the table structure, following the approach of Herzig et al. (2020) to encode the input.\nThe statement and table in a pair are tokenized into word pieces and concatenated using the standard [CLS] and [SEP] tokens in between. The table is flattened row by row and no additional separator is added between the cells or rows. 1 Based on table 2-14611590-3.html with light edits.\n7.

If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "As a sociotechnic on the deep learning model development team, it is my responsibility to consider the potential societal impacts and misuse of the google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact model. Here are some considerations for users regarding what they should not do with the model:\n\n1. **Misrepresentation of Information**: Given that the model is trained to understand and reason over tabular data, it is important that users do not use the model to intentionally misrepresent or distort information. For example, users should not use the model to generate misleading statements that are supported by data taken out of context or to confirm biased hypotheses.\n\n2. **Sensitive Data**: Users should avoid using the model on sensitive or private data without proper anonymization and consent. The model's ability to reason over tables could potentially reveal personal or confidential information if not handled correctly.\n\n3. **High-Stakes Decision Making**: The model should not be used as the sole decision-making tool in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical diagnosis, legal judgments, or financial advice, where a moderate drop in accuracy could have serious consequences. Reference 2 indicates that while the model can be sped up, it comes at the cost of accuracy, which is a critical consideration in such contexts.\n\n4. **Misuse in Automated Content Generation**: Users should not use the model to automatically generate content that could spread misinformation or be used for propaganda, especially considering the model's advanced reasoning capabilities over tabular data.\n\n5. **Bypassing Human Expertise**: The model should not be used to completely replace human expertise, especially in areas where nuanced understanding and ethical considerations are paramount. Reference 6 highlights that human accuracy remains substantially ahead of the best models, indicating the importance of human oversight.\n\n6. **Unfairness and Bias**: Users should be cautious of potential biases in the model that may arise from the data it was trained on. The TABFACT dataset, as described in reference 7, consists of sentences written by crowd workers, which could introduce biases based on the workers' interpretations and the nature of the data sourced from Wikipedia.\n\n7. **Non-Endorsement**: As stated in reference 3, this model is not an official Google product. Users should not misrepresent the model as being endorsed by or representing the views of Google.\n\nIn conclusion, while the google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact model represents a significant advancement in reasoning over tabular data, it is crucial that users employ the model responsibly, considering the potential for misuse and the societal implications of its application. Users should always ensure that their use of the model aligns with ethical guidelines and does not harm individuals or groups."}

While it represents a significant advancement in the ability to reason about information in tabular data, there are several known issues that can affect its performance:\n\n1. **Generalization to Unseen Data**: Like many machine learning models, TAPAS may struggle with generalizing to tables that have a structure or content significantly different from the data it was trained on. This can lead to incorrect predictions when encountering novel table formats or domains.\n\n2. **Complex Reasoning**: The model may have limitations in performing complex reasoning tasks that require multi-step inference or understanding implicit relationships within the data. It might not always accurately capture the nuances necessary for verifying more complex statements.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: TAPAS models are designed to understand the context within a table, but they may not always effectively incorporate broader context or common-sense knowledge that is not explicitly present in the table.\n\n4. **Data Quality and Preprocessing**: The accuracy of the model is highly dependent on the quality of the input data. Issues such as incorrect data, missing values, or poor preprocessing can lead to errors in fact verification.\n\n5. **Language Understanding**: While TAPAS is pre-trained on a large corpus of data, it may still encounter difficulties with certain linguistic nuances, such as idiomatic expressions, ambiguous phrasing, or complex sentence structures.\n\n6. **Scalability and Efficiency**: Processing large tables or a high volume of tables can be computationally intensive, which may pose challenges in terms of scalability and efficiency for real-world applications.\n\n7. **Bias and Fairness**: As with any machine learning model, TAPAS may inadvertently learn and perpetuate biases present in the training data. This can result in unfair or biased outcomes that need to be carefully monitored and addressed.\n\n8. **Error Propagation**: In a pipeline where TAPAS is one component among others, errors from previous steps (e.g., table extraction from text) can propagate and affect the performance of the fact verification task.\n\n9. **Interpretability**: Understanding the model's reasoning process can be challenging, which makes it difficult to diagnose errors or explain predictions to end-users.\n\n10. **Dependency on Structured Data**: TAPAS is designed to work with structured tabular data and may not perform well if the data is poorly structured or if the relevant information is not in tabular form.\n\nIt is important to note that while these issues can affect the model's performance, ongoing research and development in the field are aimed at addressing these challenges to improve the robustness and reliability of models like TAPAS.", "The model google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact, like many AI models, has the potential for several foreseeable harms if not properly managed or used responsibly. Here are some of the potential issues:\n\n1. **Misinformation and Misinterpretation**: If the model is used to interpret tables and present facts without proper context or verification, it could lead to the spread of misinformation. Users might take the model's outputs as truth without considering the quality of the underlying data or the model's confidence in its predictions.\n\n2. **Bias and Fairness**: The model may inherit or amplify biases present in the training data. This could result in unfair or prejudiced outcomes, particularly if the model is used in decision-making processes that affect people's lives, such as in hiring, lending, or legal judgments.\n\n3. **Privacy Concerns**: If the model processes sensitive or personal data, there is a risk of privacy breaches. This could happen if the model inadvertently reveals private information when generating outputs or if the data used to train the model is not properly anonymized.\n\n4. **Dependence and Overreliance**: Overreliance on the model for fact-checking or decision-making could lead to a lack of critical thinking and reduced human oversight. This might result in errors being overlooked and a decrease in the quality of human judgment.\n\n5. **Economic Impact**: Automation of tasks related to table interpretation and fact-checking could lead to job displacement. While it can increase efficiency, it may also have negative economic consequences for individuals whose roles are affected.\n\n6. **Security Risks**: If the model is integrated into critical systems, there is a risk of exploitation through adversarial attacks. Malicious actors could manipulate the model's inputs to produce incorrect outputs, potentially causing harm or disruption.\n\n7. **Accountability and Transparency**: Determining accountability for the model's outputs can be challenging, especially if it is used in complex decision-making processes. Lack of transparency in how the model makes its predictions can also lead to trust issues and hinder its acceptance.\n\nTo mitigate these harms, it is important to implement robust ethical guidelines, ensure transparency, and maintain human oversight when deploying models like google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact. Regular audits and updates to the model to address biases and errors, as well as clear communication about the model's capabilities and limitations, are also crucial.", "The model \"google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact\" is a specialized version of the TAPAS (Tabular Parser) model, which is fine-tuned for the task of verifying factual information in tabular data. Despite its capabilities, there are several common misunderstandings related to this model:\n\n1. **General Purpose Language Model**: Some may assume that TAPAS is a general-purpose language model like GPT-3 or BERT. However, TAPAS is specifically designed to understand and interact with tabular data, which means it is not the best choice for tasks that do not involve tables.\n\n2. **Data Source**: There might be a misconception that the model generates factual data. In reality, the model is designed to verify facts against the data it has been provided with. It does not source or generate new data.\n\n3. **Infallibility**: Users might expect the model to be infallible in fact-checking. However, like any AI model, it has limitations and can make mistakes, especially if the input data is noisy, incomplete, or the query is ambiguous.\n\n4. **Understanding of Complex Queries**: While TAPAS is fine-tuned for understanding natural language queries related to tables, it may struggle with highly complex queries or those that require understanding beyond the information present in the table.\n\n5. **Training Data**: There might be a misunderstanding about the type of data the model was trained on. The \"finetuned-tabfact\" indicates that it was specifically fine-tuned on the TabFact dataset, which consists of statements labeled as supported or refuted by tables from Wikipedia. It may not perform as well on tables with a structure or content significantly different from those in its training data.\n\n6. **Real-time Updates**: Some users might expect the model to have real-time knowledge of facts and figures. However, the model's knowledge is static and based on the data it was trained on; it does not update in real-time.\n\n7. **Scope of Use**: There could be a misconception that the model can be used for any type of fact-checking.

Despite its advanced capabilities, there are several technical limitations to consider:\n\n1. **Contextual Understanding**: While TAPAS is designed to understand the structure of tables, its ability to grasp complex, nuanced, or ambiguous contexts may be limited. It might struggle with statements that require deep understanding beyond the explicit content of the table.\n\n2. **Generalization**: The model's performance can be highly dependent on the nature of the training data. If the model encounters tables or queries that significantly differ from those in its training set, its accuracy may decrease.\n\n3. **Table Size and Complexity**: The model may have limitations in processing very large or complex tables. As the size and complexity of the table increase, the model might struggle to maintain performance due to computational constraints and the inherent difficulty of the task.\n\n4. **Language Limitations**: TAPAS models are typically trained on datasets in English, which may limit their effectiveness with tables and queries in other languages.\n\n5. **Inference and Reasoning**: The model may not always be capable of performing multi-step logical inferences or reasoning that requires external knowledge not present in the table.\n\n6. **Data Quality and Errors**: The accuracy of the model's outputs is contingent on the quality of the data in the tables.

If the training data contains biases or inaccuracies, the model may perpetuate or amplify these biases, leading to unfair or incorrect outcomes.\n\n2. **Interpretability**: As with many large models, the decision-making process of TAPAS is not easily interpretable by humans. This \"black box\" nature can be problematic in sociotechnical contexts where understanding the rationale behind a decision is crucial, such as in legal or healthcare settings.\n\n3. **Accessibility**: The complexity and resource requirements of the model may limit its accessibility to researchers and practitioners with limited computational resources, potentially creating a divide between those who can and cannot leverage its capabilities.\n\n4. **Misuse and Misinterpretation**: There is a risk that users may over-rely on the model's outputs without critical evaluation or may misinterpret the results, especially if they lack domain expertise. This can lead to the propagation of misinformation or poor decision-making.\n\n5. **Dependence on Structured Data**: The model is designed to work with tabular data, which means it may not perform well with unstructured or poorly formatted data. This limitation requires that data be preprocessed and structured appropriately, which can be a barrier to use in some contexts.\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations**: The use of automated systems to verify facts can raise ethical concerns, particularly around privacy, consent, and the potential reduction in demand for human expertise. There is also the risk of the model being used in manipulative ways, such as fabricating evidence or creating convincing misinformation.\n\n7. **Maintenance and Evolution**: The model's knowledge is static and reflects the state of the world at the time of its last update. It may not adapt well to new information or changes in the world unless it is continually retrained, which requires ongoing investment and effort.\n\n8. **Generalization**: While the model is fine-tuned for the TabFact dataset, its ability to generalize to other datasets or real-world scenarios is not guaranteed. Performance can vary significantly depending on the domain and nature of the data.\n\nAddressing these sociotechnical limitations requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving not just improvements in the model's architecture and training data but also considerations of ethical guidelines, transparency measures, and user education to ensure responsible and equitable use of the technology."]}

{"question": "bias_risks_limitations", "chain": "retrieval", "prompt": ["The model `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` is a variant of the TAPAS (Table Parsing via Pre-training) model, which is specifically fine-tuned for the task of table-based fact verification. While it represents a significant advancement in the ability to reason about information in tabular data, there are several known issues that can affect its performance:\n\n1. **Generalization to Unseen Data**: Like many machine learning models, TAPAS may struggle with generalizing to tables that have a structure or content significantly different from the data it was trained on. This can lead to incorrect predictions when encountering novel table formats or domains.\n\n2. **Complex Reasoning**: The model may have limitations in performing complex reasoning tasks that require multi-step inference or understanding implicit relationships within the data. It might not always accurately capture the nuances necessary for verifying more complex statements.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: TAPAS models are designed to understand the context within a table, but they may not always effectively incorporate broader context or common-sense knowledge that is not explicitly present in the table.\n\n4. **Data Quality and Preprocessing**: The accuracy of the model is highly dependent on the quality of the input data. Issues such as incorrect data, missing values, or poor preprocessing can lead to errors in fact verification.\n\n5. **Language Understanding**: While TAPAS is pre-trained on a large corpus of data, it may still encounter difficulties with certain linguistic nuances, such as idiomatic expressions, ambiguous phrasing, or complex sentence structures.\n\n6. **Scalability and Efficiency**: Processing large tables or a high volume of tables can be computationally intensive, which may pose challenges in terms of scalability and efficiency for real-world applications.\n\n7. **Bias and Fairness**: As with any machine learning model, TAPAS may inadvertently learn and perpetuate biases present in the training data. This can result in unfair or biased outcomes that need to be carefully monitored and addressed.\n\n8. **Error Propagation**: In a pipeline where TAPAS is one component among others, errors from previous steps (e.g., table extraction from text) can propagate and affect the performance of the fact verification task.\n\n9. **Interpretability**: Understanding the model's reasoning process can be challenging, which makes it difficult to diagnose errors or explain predictions to end-users.\n\n10. **Dependency on Structured Data**: TAPAS is designed to work with structured tabular data and may not perform well if the data is poorly structured or if the relevant information is not in tabular form.\n\nIt is important to note that while these issues can affect the model's performance, ongoing research and development in the field are aimed at addressing these challenges to improve the robustness and reliability of models like TAPAS.", "The model google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact, like many AI models, has the potential for several foreseeable harms if not properly managed or used responsibly. Here are some of the potential issues:\n\n1. **Misinformation and Misinterpretation**: If the model is used to interpret tables and present facts without proper context or verification, it could lead to the spread of misinformation. Users might take the model's outputs as truth without considering the quality of the underlying data or the model's confidence in its predictions.\n\n2. **Bias and Fairness**: The model may inherit or amplify biases present in the training data. This could result in unfair or prejudiced outcomes, particularly if the model is used in decision-making processes that affect people's lives, such as in hiring, lending, or legal judgments.\n\n3. **Privacy Concerns**: If the model processes sensitive or personal data, there is a risk of privacy breaches. This could happen if the model inadvertently reveals private information when generating outputs or if the data used to train the model is not properly anonymized.\n\n4. **Dependence and Overreliance**: Overreliance on the model for fact-checking or decision-making could lead to a lack of critical thinking and reduced human oversight. This might result in errors being overlooked and a decrease in the quality of human judgment.\n\n5. **Economic Impact**: Automation of tasks related to table interpretation and fact-checking could lead to job displacement. While it can increase efficiency, it may also have negative economic consequences for individuals whose roles are affected.\n\n6. **Security Risks**: If the model is integrated into critical systems, there is a risk of exploitation through adversarial attacks. Malicious actors could manipulate the model's inputs to produce incorrect outputs, potentially causing harm or disruption.\n\n7. **Accountability and Transparency**: Determining accountability for the model's outputs can be challenging, especially if it is used in complex decision-making processes. Lack of transparency in how the model makes its predictions can also lead to trust issues and hinder its acceptance.\n\nTo mitigate these harms, it is important to implement robust ethical guidelines, ensure transparency, and maintain human oversight when deploying models like google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact. Regular audits and updates to the model to address biases and errors, as well as clear communication about the model's capabilities and limitations, are also crucial.", "The model \"google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact\" is a specialized version of the TAPAS (Tabular Parser) model, which is fine-tuned for the task of verifying factual information in tabular data. Despite its capabilities, there are several common misunderstandings related to this model:\n\n1. **General Purpose Language Model**: Some may assume that TAPAS is a general-purpose language model like GPT-3 or BERT. However, TAPAS is specifically designed to understand and interact with tabular data, which means it is not the best choice for tasks that do not involve tables.\n\n2. **Data Source**: There might be a misconception that the model generates factual data. In reality, the model is designed to verify facts against the data it has been provided with. It does not source or generate new data.\n\n3. **Infallibility**: Users might expect the model to be infallible in fact-checking. However, like any AI model, it has limitations and can make mistakes, especially if the input data is noisy, incomplete, or the query is ambiguous.\n\n4. **Understanding of Complex Queries**: While TAPAS is fine-tuned for understanding natural language queries related to tables, it may struggle with highly complex queries or those that require understanding beyond the information present in the table.\n\n5. **Training Data**: There might be a misunderstanding about the type of data the model was trained on. The \"finetuned-tabfact\" indicates that it was specifically fine-tuned on the TabFact dataset, which consists of statements labeled as supported or refuted by tables from Wikipedia. It may not perform as well on tables with a structure or content significantly different from those in its training data.\n\n6. **Real-time Updates**: Some users might expect the model to have real-time knowledge of facts and figures. However, the model's knowledge is static and based on the data it was trained on; it does not update in real-time.\n\n7. **Scope of Use**: There could be a misconception that the model can be used for any type of fact-checking. Its use case is primarily for checking facts that can be verified by a given table, not for checking facts that require external validation or cross-referencing with other sources.\n\nUnderstanding these common misunderstandings can help users better appreciate the strengths and limitations of the \"google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact\" model and use it more effectively for their specific needs.", "The model `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` is a specialized version of the TAPAS (Tabular Parser) model, which is fine-tuned for the task of verifying factual statements by accessing information contained in tables. Despite its advanced capabilities, there are several technical limitations to consider:\n\n1. **Contextual Understanding**: While TAPAS is designed to understand the structure of tables, its ability to grasp complex, nuanced, or ambiguous contexts may be limited. It might struggle with statements that require deep understanding beyond the explicit content of the table.\n\n2. **Generalization**: The model's performance can be highly dependent on the nature of the training data. If the model encounters tables or queries that significantly differ from those in its training set, its accuracy may decrease.\n\n3. **Table Size and Complexity**: The model may have limitations in processing very large or complex tables. As the size and complexity of the table increase, the model might struggle to maintain performance due to computational constraints and the inherent difficulty of the task.\n\n4. **Language Limitations**: TAPAS models are typically trained on datasets in English, which may limit their effectiveness with tables and queries in other languages.\n\n5. **Inference and Reasoning**: The model may not always be capable of performing multi-step logical inferences or reasoning that requires external knowledge not present in the table.\n\n6. **Data Quality and Errors**: The accuracy of the model's outputs is contingent on the quality of the data in the tables. Errors or inconsistencies in the table data can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\n7. **Computational Resources**: As a large model, `tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` requires significant computational resources for both training and inference, which can be a limitation for users without access to appropriate hardware.\n\n8. **Real-time Processing**: Due to its complexity, the model might not be suitable for real-time applications where immediate response is critical.\n\n9. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: The model might not perform well on tables that require domain-specific knowledge unless it has been specifically trained or fine-tuned on data from that domain.\n\n10. **Bias and Fairness**: Like many machine learning models, TAPAS could potentially inherit biases present in its training data, leading to biased predictions that could affect fairness and ethical considerations.\n\nUnderstanding these limitations is crucial for developers and researchers when integrating the model into applications, as it helps set realistic expectations and guides the development of strategies to mitigate potential issues.", "The model \"google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact\" is a specialized version of the TAPAS (Tabular Parser) model, which is fine-tuned for the task of verifying factual information in tabular data. Despite its advanced capabilities, it has several sociotechnical limitations:\n\n1. **Data Bias**: The model's performance is contingent on the data it was trained on. If the training data contains biases or inaccuracies, the model may perpetuate or amplify these biases, leading to unfair or incorrect outcomes.\n\n2. **Interpretability**: As with many large models, the decision-making process of TAPAS is not easily interpretable by humans. This \"black box\" nature can be problematic in sociotechnical contexts where understanding the rationale behind a decision is crucial, such as in legal or healthcare settings.\n\n3. **Accessibility**: The complexity and resource requirements of the model may limit its accessibility to researchers and practitioners with limited computational resources, potentially creating a divide between those who can and cannot leverage its capabilities.\n\n4. **Misuse and Misinterpretation**: There is a risk that users may over-rely on the model's outputs without critical evaluation or may misinterpret the results, especially if they lack domain expertise. This can lead to the propagation of misinformation or poor decision-making.\n\n5. **Dependence on Structured Data**: The model is designed to work with tabular data, which means it may not perform well with unstructured or poorly formatted data. This limitation requires that data be preprocessed and structured appropriately, which can be a barrier to use in some contexts.\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations**: The use of automated systems to verify facts can raise ethical concerns, particularly around privacy, consent, and the potential reduction in demand for human expertise. There is also the risk of the model being used in manipulative ways, such as fabricating evidence or creating convincing misinformation.\n\n7. **Maintenance and Evolution**: The model's knowledge is static and reflects the state of the world at the time of its last update. It may not adapt well to new information or changes in the world unless it is continually retrained, which requires ongoing investment and effort.\n\n8. **Generalization**: While the model is fine-tuned for the TabFact dataset, its ability to generalize to other datasets or real-world scenarios is not guaranteed. Performance can vary significantly depending on the domain and nature of the data.\n\nAddressing these sociotechnical limitations requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving not just improvements in the model's architecture and training data but also considerations of ethical guidelines, transparency measures, and user education to ensure responsible and equitable use of the technology."], "answer": ["Model Agreement Similar to other complex binary classification datasets such as BOOLQ , for TABFACT one may question whether models are guessing the right answer. To detect the magnitude of this issue we look at 9 independent runs of each variant and analyze how many of them agree on the correct answer. Figure 5 shows that while for MASK-LM only for 24.2% of the examples all models agree on the right answer, it goes up to 55.5% when using using the counterfactual and synthetic pre-training. This suggests", "In Figure 4 we show examples in every group where our model is correct on the majority of the cases (across 9 trials), and the MASK-LM baseline is not. We also show examples that continue to produce errors after our pre-training. Many examples in this last group require multi-hop reasoning or complex numerical operations.", "Salient Groups To obtain detailed information of the improvements of our approach, we manually annotated 200 random examples with the complex operations needed to answer them. We found 4 salient groups: Aggregations, superlatives, com-paratives and negations, and sort pairs into these groups via keywords in the text. To make the groups exclusive, we add a fifth case when more than one operation is needed. The accuracy of the heuristics was validated through further manual inspection of 50 samples per group.", "Among the groups, the intermediate task data improve superlatives (39% error reduction) and negations (31%) most (Table 5). For example, we see that the accuracy is higher for superlatives than the for the overall validation set.", "For each group within the validation set, we look at the difference in accuracy between different models. We also look at how the total error rate is divided among the groups as a way to guide the focus on pre-training tasks and modeling. The error rate defined in this way measures potential accuracy gains if all the errors in a group S were fixed:\nER(S) = |{ Errors in S}| |{ Validation examples}| .", "We introduced two pre-training tasks, counterfactual and synthetic, to obtain state-of-the-art results on the TABFACT  entailment task on tabular data. We adapted the BERT-based architecture of TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020) to binary classification and showed that pre-training on both tasks yields substantial improvements on TAB-FACT but also on a QA dataset, SQA (Iyyer et al., 2017), even with only a subset of the training data.", "We ran a study on column selection methods to speed-up training and inference. We found that we can speed up the model by a factor of 2 at a moderate drop in accuracy (\u2248 1 point) and by a factor of 4 at a larger drop but still with higher accuracy than previous approaches.\nWe characterized the complex operations required for table entailment to guide future research in this topic. Our code and models will be opensourced.", "TAPAS is essentialy a BERT model and thus has the same [requirements](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/README.md#out-of-memory-issues).\nThis means that training the large model with 512 sequence length will\nrequire a TPU.\nYou can use the option `max_seq_length` to create shorter sequences. This will\nreduce accuracy but also make the model trainable on GPUs.\nAnother option is to reduce the batch size (`train_batch_size`),\nbut this will likely also affect accuracy."]}

This can result in unfair or biased outcomes that need to be carefully monitored and addressed.\n\n8. **Error Propagation**: In a pipeline where TAPAS is one component among others, errors from previous steps (e.g., table extraction from text) can propagate and affect the performance of the fact verification task.\n\n9. **Interpretability**: Understanding the model's reasoning process can be challenging, which makes it difficult to diagnose errors or explain predictions to end-users.\n\n10. **Dependency on Structured Data**: TAPAS is designed to work with structured tabular data and may not perform well if the data is poorly structured or if the relevant information is not in tabular form.\n\nIt is important to note that while these issues can affect the model's performance, ongoing research and development in the field are aimed at addressing these challenges to improve the robustness and reliability of models like TAPAS.", "The model google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact, like many AI models, has the potential for several foreseeable harms if not properly managed or used responsibly. Here are some of the potential issues:\n\n1. **Misinformation and Misinterpretation**: If the model is used to interpret tables and present facts without proper context or verification, it could lead to the spread of misinformation. Users might take the model's outputs as truth without considering the quality of the underlying data or the model's confidence in its predictions.\n\n2. **Bias and Fairness**: The model may inherit or amplify biases present in the training data. This could result in unfair or prejudiced outcomes, particularly if the model is used in decision-making processes that affect people's lives, such as in hiring, lending, or legal judgments.\n\n3. **Privacy Concerns**: If the model processes sensitive or personal data, there is a risk of privacy breaches. This could happen if the model inadvertently reveals private information when generating outputs or if the data used to train the model is not properly anonymized.\n\n4. **Dependence and Overreliance**: Overreliance on the model for fact-checking or decision-making could lead to a lack of critical thinking and reduced human oversight. This might result in errors being overlooked and a decrease in the quality of human judgment.\n\n5. **Economic Impact**: Automation of tasks related to table interpretation and fact-checking could lead to job displacement. While it can increase efficiency, it may also have negative economic consequences for individuals whose roles are affected.\n\n6. **Security Risks**: If the model is integrated into critical systems, there is a risk of exploitation through adversarial attacks. Malicious actors could manipulate the model's inputs to produce incorrect outputs, potentially causing harm or disruption.\n\n7. **Accountability and Transparency**: Determining accountability for the model's outputs can be challenging, especially if it is used in complex decision-making processes. Lack of transparency in how the model makes its predictions can also lead to trust issues and hinder its acceptance.\n\nTo mitigate these harms, it is important to implement robust ethical guidelines, ensure transparency, and maintain human oversight when deploying models like google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact. Regular audits and updates to the model to address biases and errors, as well as clear communication about the model's capabilities and limitations, are also crucial.", "The model \"google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact\" is a specialized version of the TAPAS (Tabular Parser) model, which is fine-tuned for the task of verifying factual information in tabular data. Despite its capabilities, there are several common misunderstandings related to this model:\n\n1. **General Purpose Language Model**: Some may assume that TAPAS is a general-purpose language model like GPT-3 or BERT. However, TAPAS is specifically designed to understand and interact with tabular data, which means it is not the best choice for tasks that do not involve tables.\n\n2. **Data Source**: There might be a misconception that the model generates factual data. In reality, the model is designed to verify facts against the data it has been provided with. It does not source or generate new data.\n\n3. **Infallibility**: Users might expect the model to be infallible in fact-checking. However, like any AI model, it has limitations and can make mistakes, especially if the input data is noisy, incomplete, or the query is ambiguous.\n\n4. **Understanding of Complex Queries**: While TAPAS is fine-tuned for understanding natural language queries related to tables, it may struggle with highly complex queries or those that require understanding beyond the information present in the table.\n\n5. **Training Data**: There might be a misunderstanding about the type of data the model was trained on. The \"finetuned-tabfact\" indicates that it was specifically fine-tuned on the TabFact dataset, which consists of statements labeled as supported or refuted by tables from Wikipedia. It may not perform as well on tables with a structure or content significantly different from those in its training data.\n\n6. **Real-time Updates**: Some users might expect the model to have real-time knowledge of facts and figures. However, the model's knowledge is static and based on the data it was trained on; it does not update in real-time.\n\n7. **Scope of Use**: There could be a misconception that the model can be used for any type of fact-checking. Its use case is primarily for checking facts that can be verified by a given table, not for checking facts that require external validation or cross-referencing with other sources.\n\nUnderstanding these common misunderstandings can help users better appreciate the strengths and limitations of the \"google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact\" model and use it more effectively for their specific needs.", "The model `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` is a specialized version of the TAPAS (Tabular Parser) model, which is fine-tuned for the task of verifying factual statements by accessing information contained in tables.

It might struggle with statements that require deep understanding beyond the explicit content of the table.\n\n2. **Generalization**: The model's performance can be highly dependent on the nature of the training data. If the model encounters tables or queries that significantly differ from those in its training set, its accuracy may decrease.\n\n3. **Table Size and Complexity**: The model may have limitations in processing very large or complex tables. As the size and complexity of the table increase, the model might struggle to maintain performance due to computational constraints and the inherent difficulty of the task.\n\n4. **Language Limitations**: TAPAS models are typically trained on datasets in English, which may limit their effectiveness with tables and queries in other languages.\n\n5. **Inference and Reasoning**: The model may not always be capable of performing multi-step logical inferences or reasoning that requires external knowledge not present in the table.\n\n6. **Data Quality and Errors**: The accuracy of the model's outputs is contingent on the quality of the data in the tables. Errors or inconsistencies in the table data can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n\n7. **Computational Resources**: As a large model, `tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` requires significant computational resources for both training and inference, which can be a limitation for users without access to appropriate hardware.\n\n8. **Real-time Processing**: Due to its complexity, the model might not be suitable for real-time applications where immediate response is critical.\n\n9. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: The model might not perform well on tables that require domain-specific knowledge unless it has been specifically trained or fine-tuned on data from that domain.\n\n10. **Bias and Fairness**: Like many machine learning models, TAPAS could potentially inherit biases present in its training data, leading to biased predictions that could affect fairness and ethical considerations.\n\nUnderstanding these limitations is crucial for developers and researchers when integrating the model into applications, as it helps set realistic expectations and guides the development of strategies to mitigate potential issues.", "The model \"google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact\" is a specialized version of the TAPAS (Tabular Parser) model, which is fine-tuned for the task of verifying factual information in tabular data.

If the training data contains biases or inaccuracies, the model may perpetuate or amplify these biases, leading to unfair or incorrect outcomes.\n\n2. **Interpretability**: As with many large models, the decision-making process of TAPAS is not easily interpretable by humans. This \"black box\" nature can be problematic in sociotechnical contexts where understanding the rationale behind a decision is crucial, such as in legal or healthcare settings.\n\n3. **Accessibility**: The complexity and resource requirements of the model may limit its accessibility to researchers and practitioners with limited computational resources, potentially creating a divide between those who can and cannot leverage its capabilities.\n\n4. **Misuse and Misinterpretation**: There is a risk that users may over-rely on the model's outputs without critical evaluation or may misinterpret the results, especially if they lack domain expertise. This can lead to the propagation of misinformation or poor decision-making.\n\n5. **Dependence on Structured Data**: The model is designed to work with tabular data, which means it may not perform well with unstructured or poorly formatted data. This limitation requires that data be preprocessed and structured appropriately, which can be a barrier to use in some contexts.\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations**: The use of automated systems to verify facts can raise ethical concerns, particularly around privacy, consent, and the potential reduction in demand for human expertise.

Model Agreement Similar to other complex binary classification datasets such as BOOLQ , for TABFACT one may question whether models are guessing the right answer. To detect the magnitude of this issue we look at 9 independent runs of each variant and analyze how many of them agree on the correct answer. Figure 5 shows that while for MASK-LM only for 24.2% of the examples all models agree on the right answer, it goes up to 55.5% when using using the counterfactual and synthetic pre-training. This suggests\n2. In Figure 4 we show examples in every group where our model is correct on the majority of the cases (across 9 trials), and the MASK-LM baseline is not. We also show examples that continue to produce errors after our pre-training. Many examples in this last group require multi-hop reasoning or complex numerical operations.\n3. Salient Groups To obtain detailed information of the improvements of our approach, we manually annotated 200 random examples with the complex operations needed to answer them. We found 4 salient groups: Aggregations, superlatives, com-paratives and negations, and sort pairs into these groups via keywords in the text. To make the groups exclusive, we add a fifth case when more than one operation is needed. The accuracy of the heuristics was validated through further manual inspection of 50 samples per group.\n4. Among the groups, the intermediate task data improve superlatives (39% error reduction) and negations (31%) most (Table 5). For example, we see that the accuracy is higher for superlatives than the for the overall validation set.\n5. For each group within the validation set, we look at the difference in accuracy between different models. We also look at how the total error rate is divided among the groups as a way to guide the focus on pre-training tasks and modeling. The error rate defined in this way measures potential accuracy gains if all the errors in a group S were fixed:\nER(S) = |{ Errors in S}| |{ Validation examples}| .\n6. We introduced two pre-training tasks, counterfactual and synthetic, to obtain state-of-the-art results on the TABFACT  entailment task on tabular data. We adapted the BERT-based architecture of TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020) to binary classification and showed that pre-training on both tasks yields substantial improvements on TAB-FACT but also on a QA dataset, SQA (Iyyer et al., 2017), even with only a subset of the training data.\n7. We ran a study on column selection methods to speed-up training and inference. We found that we can speed up the model by a factor of 2 at a moderate drop in accuracy (\u2248 1 point) and by a factor of 4 at a larger drop but still with higher accuracy than previous approaches.\nWe characterized the complex operations required for table entailment to guide future research in this topic. Our code and models will be opensourced.\n8. TAPAS is essentialy a BERT model and thus has the same [requirements](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/README.md#out-of-memory-issues).\nThis means that training the large model with 512 sequence length will\nrequire a TPU.\nYou can use the option `max_seq_length` to create shorter sequences.

Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "The model google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact, while achieving state-of-the-art results on the TABFACT entailment task, presents several known and foreseeable issues that can be categorized into technical and sociotechnical limitations:\n\n1. **Model Agreement and Guessing**: As indicated in the references, there is a concern that models might be guessing the correct answers rather than truly understanding the entailment task. The agreement among independent runs of the model variants suggests that there is still a significant portion of examples where not all models agree on the correct answer, indicating potential variability in model performance and a lack of robustness.\n\n2. **Complex Reasoning Limitations**: The model struggles with examples that require multi-hop reasoning or complex numerical operations. This limitation could lead to errors in scenarios where sophisticated reasoning is required, potentially affecting the reliability of the model in critical applications.\n\n3. **Error Distribution Among Salient Groups**: The model's performance varies across different types of operations such as aggregations, superlatives, comparatives, negations, and combinations thereof. While there have been improvements in handling superlatives and negations, other complex operations might still pose challenges, leading to uneven accuracy across different types of entailment tasks.\n\n4. **Pre-training Tasks and Data**: The introduction of counterfactual and synthetic pre-training tasks has improved performance, but the reliance on these tasks may also introduce biases based on the nature of the pre-training data. The model's understanding and generalization capabilities are shaped by the data it is trained on, which could limit its applicability to diverse real-world scenarios.\n\n5. **Computational Requirements**: The model, being a large BERT-based architecture, requires significant computational resources, such as TPUs, for training with longer sequence lengths. This not only limits accessibility for researchers and practitioners with fewer resources but also raises concerns about the environmental impact of training such large models.\n\n6. **Speed-Accuracy Trade-off**: Efforts to speed up training and inference by selecting fewer columns come at the cost of a drop in accuracy. This trade-off must be carefully considered in applications where speed is critical but high accuracy is also required.\n\n7. **Sociotechnical Considerations**: The model's performance and its potential biases have implications for fairness and equity. If the model is deployed in decision-making systems, errors or biases could disproportionately affect certain groups or individuals, leading to unfair outcomes. Additionally, the reliance on sophisticated technology like TPUs raises questions about the digital divide and the equitable distribution of AI benefits.\n\n8. **Transparency and Openness**: While the code and models are open-sourced, which is a positive step towards transparency, users of the model must have a clear understanding of its limitations and the contexts in which it has been trained and tested. Without this understanding, there is a risk of misuse or over-reliance on the model's outputs.\n\nIn conclusion, while google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact represents a significant advancement in table entailment tasks, it is important to be aware of its limitations, both technical and sociotechnical, to mitigate potential harms and misunderstandings. Further research and development are needed to address these issues and ensure that the model can be used responsibly and effectively in a variety of contexts."}

{"question": "bias_recommendations", "chain": "rev_retrieval", "prompt": ["The model \"google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact\" is a specialized version of the TAPAS (Tabular Parser) model, which is fine-tuned for the task of verifying factual information in tabular data. While this model offers powerful capabilities for interpreting and analyzing structured data, there are several foreseeable issues that users and developers should be aware of:\n\n1. Data Quality and Representation: The model's performance is highly dependent on the quality and representation of the input data. If the tables contain errors, are incomplete, or are formatted inconsistently, the model's predictions may be unreliable. It is recommended to implement robust data validation and preprocessing steps to ensure the accuracy of the input.\n\n2. Contextual Limitations: The model may struggle with understanding the context or intent behind certain queries, especially if they require external knowledge or are ambiguous. Users should be prepared to provide additional context or clarification when necessary.\n\n3. Bias and Fairness: Like any machine learning model, TAPAS may inadvertently learn and perpetuate biases present in the training data. It is important to evaluate the model for fairness and bias, particularly if it will be used in decision-making processes that could affect individuals or groups.\n\n4. Generalization and Domain Adaptation: The model may not generalize well to tables from domains that are significantly different from those it was trained on. Users should consider additional fine-tuning or domain-specific training if they plan to use the model with specialized or niche datasets.\n\n5. Computational Resources: As a large model, TAPAS may require substantial computational resources for both training and inference. Users should ensure they have the necessary hardware or access to cloud computing services to handle the model's demands.\n\n6. Interpretability and Explainability: Understanding the reasoning behind the model's predictions can be challenging. Providing explanations for the model's decisions is crucial, especially in sensitive applications. Users may need to implement additional tools or methods to improve the interpretability of the model's outputs.\n\n7. Dependence on Structured Data: The model is designed to work with tabular data and may not perform well with unstructured data. Users should be aware of this limitation and consider alternative models or approaches when dealing with non-tabular data.\n\n8.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references, here are some recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact`:\n\n1. **Model Agreement and Generalization**: The model shows varying levels of agreement on the correct answer across different runs (Reference 1). To mitigate potential overfitting and ensure that the model is not simply guessing the right answers, it is recommended to continue evaluating the model across multiple independent runs and possibly expand the dataset with more diverse examples to improve generalization.\n\n2. **Complex Reasoning**: The model struggles with multi-hop reasoning or complex numerical operations (Reference 2). It is advisable to further research and develop techniques that can enhance the model's ability to handle such complex reasoning tasks. This could involve creating more sophisticated pre-training tasks that mimic these reasoning challenges.\n\n3. **Salient Groups and Error Analysis**: The model's performance varies across different types of operations such as aggregations, superlatives, comparatives, and negations (Reference 3). A detailed error analysis should be conducted to identify specific weaknesses and to guide future improvements. Focusing on the types of operations where the model underperforms could lead to targeted enhancements in those areas.\n\n4. **Pre-training Tasks**: The intermediate task data show significant improvements in handling superlatives and negations (Reference 4). It is recommended to continue developing and refining intermediate pre-training tasks that can further reduce errors in these and other salient groups identified.\n\n5. **Error Rate Distribution**: Understanding how the total error rate is divided among different groups can inform where to focus pre-training tasks and modeling efforts (Reference 5). It is recommended to use this information to prioritize model improvements and to allocate resources effectively.\n\n6. **Transparency and Reproducibility**: The release of code, models, and a Colab notebook (Reference 6) is a positive step towards transparency and reproducibility. It is recommended to maintain this level of openness, allowing the community to replicate and build upon the work.\n\n7. **Benchmarking and Continuous Improvement**: The model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on TABFACT (Reference 7). However, there is still a gap compared to human accuracy (Reference 8). Continuous benchmarking against the latest models and datasets is recommended to ensure that the model remains competitive and to identify areas for further improvement.\n\n8. **Ethical Considerations**: As a sociotechnic, it is important to consider the ethical implications of the model's deployment. This includes ensuring that the model does not propagate biases present in the training data and that its use in applications respects user privacy and data security.\n\nIn summary, the recommendations focus on improving the model's reasoning capabilities, refining pre-training tasks, conducting detailed error analyses, maintaining transparency, continuous benchmarking, and addressing ethical considerations."}

TAPAS is built on top of the BERT architecture, which uses the WordPiece tokenization method. The tokenization process for TAPAS involves several steps to prepare both the natural language questions and the tabular data for processing by the model.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the tokenization process for the data used by the `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` model:\n\n1. **Question Tokenization**: The natural language question is tokenized using the WordPiece tokenizer. This involves breaking down the question into subword units that can be found in a predefined vocabulary. Rare words are split into smaller, more common subwords, allowing the model to handle a wide range of vocabulary with a fixed-size vocabulary list.\n\n2. **Table Flattening**: The tabular data is flattened into a sequence format that the model can process. This involves serializing the table's rows and columns into a linear format, with special tokens used to indicate the structure of the table, such as the start of a row, column headers, and cell values.\n\n3. **Special Tokens**: TAPAS uses special tokens to understand the structure of the table and the relationship between the question and the table. These include [CLS] (classification token), [SEP] (separator token), and other tokens to represent hierarchical positions of rows and columns.\n\n4. **Column and Row Embeddings**: To preserve the two-dimensional structure of the table, TAPAS adds column and row embeddings to the token embeddings. This helps the model to understand the positional context of each cell within the table.\n\n5. **Segment Embeddings**: The model uses segment embeddings to differentiate between the question and the table. This is similar to how BERT uses segment embeddings to distinguish between two sentences in a pair.\n\n6. **Positional Encodings**: Since the transformer architecture used in BERT does not have a notion of token position by default, positional encodings are added to the token embeddings to provide information about the order of tokens.\n\n7. **Masking**: Similar to BERT's pre-training, some of the tokens may be masked during the training process to enable the model to learn to predict the masked words, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the context.\n\nOnce the tokenization process is complete, the resulting input sequence\u2014comprising the tokenized question, the serialized table, and the various embeddings\u2014is fed into the TAPAS model for processing.

TAPAS is an algorithm that is designed to understand tabular data and answer questions about it, and it is built upon the transformer architecture, similar to BERT.\n\nWhen it comes to the resizing or rewriting process for the data used by this model, it generally involves adapting the input tabular data and associated natural language queries to a format that the model can process. Here's a brief overview of how the data is typically prepared:\n\n1. **Tabular Data Conversion**: TAPAS models are designed to work with tabular data, which means that the data must be presented in a structured table format. Each table is serialized into a linear format that can be processed by the transformer model. This involves concatenating the rows and columns into a sequence of tokens.\n\n2. **Question Rewriting**: The natural language queries or statements that are used to probe the table for information may need to be rewritten or reformulated to ensure clarity and to match the format expected by the model. This can involve standardizing the language or phrasing of the questions.\n\n3. **Tokenization**: Both the serialized table and the natural language query are tokenized using a tokenizer that is compatible with the TAPAS model. This tokenizer converts the text into a sequence of tokens that can be processed by the neural network.\n\n4. **Input Formatting**: The tokenized table and query are combined into a single input sequence with special tokens to separate and identify different parts of the input (e.g., [CLS], [SEP]). The model also uses positional embeddings to keep track of the structure of the table.\n\n5. **Attention Masks**: Since TAPAS is based on the transformer architecture, it uses attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different tokens. Attention masks are created to help the model focus on relevant parts of the input for a given query.\n\n6. **Segment Embeddings**: To help the model distinguish between the table and the query, segment embeddings are used. These embeddings are added to the token embeddings before being fed into the model.\n\nDuring fine-tuning on the TABFACT dataset, the model is trained to understand the relationship between the content of the tables and the statements made about them, learning to classify statements as either 'entailed' or 'refuted' by the information in the table. The resizing or rewriting process is crucial to ensure that the data is in a form that allows the model to learn from the fine-tuning examples effectively.\n\nIt's important to note that the resizing or rewriting process is not about changing the size of the data but rather about transforming the data into a format that is suitable for the model to process and learn from."]}

Heuristic entity linking (HEL) is used as a baseline. It is the table pruning used in TABLE-BERT . The algorithm aligns spans in statement to the columns by extracting the longest character n-gram that matches a cell. The span matches represent linked entities. Each entity in the statement can be linked to only one column. We use the provided entity linking statements data 5 . We run the TAPAS algorithm on top of the input data to limit the input size.\n9. The TAPAS model handles this by shrinking the text in cells. A token selection algorithm loops over the cells. For each cell it starts by selecting the first token, then the second and so on until the maximal length is reached. Unless stated otherwise we use the same approach. Crucially, selecting only relevant columns would allow longer examples to fit without discarding potentially relevant tokens.\n10. Table entailment, the binary classification task of finding if a sentence is supported or refuted by the content of a table, requires parsing language and table structure as well as numerical and discrete reasoning. While there is extensive work on textual entailment, table entailment is less well studied. We adapt TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020), a table-based BERT model, to recognize entailment. Motivated by the benefits of data augmentation, we create a balanced dataset of millions of automatically created\n11. Heuristic entity linking (HEL) is used as a baseline.

If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "The preprocessing for the data of the model `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact` involves several steps to prepare the input for the model:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: The statement and table in a pair are tokenized into word pieces. This is done using the BERT tokenizer, which splits the input text into subword units called word pieces. The tokenization process involves encoding the statement and the flattened table row by row, concatenating them with the standard [CLS] token at the beginning and [SEP] tokens in between the statement and table, as well as at the end of the sequence (Reference 1).\n\n2. **Table Flattening**: The table is flattened row by row without adding additional separators between the cells or rows. This means that the content of the table is serialized into a sequence of tokens that can be processed by the model (Reference 1).\n\n3. **Input Embeddings**: Six types of learnable input embeddings are added together. These include token embeddings, position embeddings, and segment embeddings, which are analogous to the ones used in standard BERT. Additionally, column and row embeddings are used to encode the two-dimensional position of the cell that the token corresponds to, and rank embeddings are used for numeric columns to encode the numeric rank of the cell within the column (Reference 2).\n\n4. **Handling Long Inputs**: For input examples that are too long for BERT-based models, table pruning techniques are evaluated as a pre-processing step. This involves selecting relevant columns to respect the input example length limits of the transformer. The TAPAS model also includes a token selection algorithm that loops over the cells, selecting tokens sequentially until the maximal length is reached, which helps to fit longer examples without discarding potentially relevant tokens (References 6, 7, 9).\n\n5. **Heuristic Entity Linking (HEL)**: HEL is used as a baseline table pruning technique. It aligns spans in the statement to the columns by extracting the longest character n-gram that matches a cell. This helps to link entities in the statement to a single column in the table, which is used to limit the input size for the model (References 8, 11).\n\nThe preprocessing steps are designed to convert the tabular data and associated statements into a format that can be effectively processed by the TAPAS model, which is fine-tuned for the task of table entailment. The model needs to parse language and table structure and perform numerical and discrete reasoning to determine if a sentence is supported or refuted by the content of a table (Reference 10)."}

Throughput is an important performance metric, especially when deploying models in production environments where they need to handle multiple requests simultaneously and deliver results with low latency.\n\nHowever, as an AI language model, I don't have direct access to the runtime performance metrics of specific models, including `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact`. The throughput can be influenced by several factors, including:\n\n1. **Hardware Specifications**: The computational resources available, such as CPU/GPU type, memory bandwidth, and disk I/O, can significantly affect the throughput. Models running on more powerful hardware with dedicated accelerators like TPUs or high-end GPUs will generally have higher throughput.\n\n2. **Model Complexity**: Larger models with more parameters, like `tapas-large`, typically require more computation per query, which can reduce throughput compared to smaller, less complex models.\n\n3. **Batch Size**: Processing multiple examples in a batch can improve throughput by taking advantage of parallel processing capabilities of modern hardware. However, there is a trade-off between batch size and memory consumption, as well as the potential increase in latency.\n\n4. **Optimization and Quantization**: Models that have been optimized for production, for example, through techniques like quantization or pruning, may have higher throughput due to reduced computational requirements.\n\n5. **Software Frameworks**: The machine learning frameworks and libraries used to run the model, as well as the efficiency of the underlying implementation, can also impact throughput.\n\nTo get specific throughput metrics for `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact`, you would typically need to run benchmark tests under controlled conditions that reflect your use case. This involves setting up the model on the target hardware, configuring it with the desired batch size, and measuring the number of queries it can process over a set period.

Section 3.3 and Appendix A.4, we can increase the model efficiency by reducing the input length. By pruning the input of the TABFACT data we can improve training as well as inference time. We compare pruning with the heuristic entity linking (HEL)  and heuristic exact match (HEM) to different target lengths. We also studied other pruning methods, the results are reported in Appendix F. In Table 4 we find that HEM consistently outperforms HEL. The best model at length 256, while twice as fast to train (and\n9. apply), is only 0.8 points behind the best full length model. Even the model    with length 128, while using a much shorter length, out-performs TABLE-BERT by more than 7 points. Given a pre-trained MASK-LM model our training consists of training on the artificial pre-training data and then fine-tuning on TABFACT. We can therefore improve the training time by pre-training with shorter input sizes. Table 4 shows that 512 and 256 give similar accuracy while the results for 128 are about 1 point lower.\n10. TABFACT In Table 2 we find that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on TAB-FACT by more than 6 points (Base) or more than 9 points (Large). A model initialized only with the public TAPAS MASK-LM checkpoint is behind state-of-the-art by 2 points (71.7% vs 69.9%). If we train on the counterfactual data, it out-performs LOGICALFACTCHECKER and reaches 75.2% test accuracy (+5.3), slightly above using SQA.

Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "The model google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact is designed to address the task of table entailment, which involves determining whether statements are supported or refuted by the information presented in tables from Wikipedia. Based on the references provided, several characteristics can be anticipated to influence the model's behavior:\n\n1. **Domain and Context**: The model is trained on the TABFACT dataset, which consists of statements related to tables from Wikipedia. Therefore, the model's performance is likely to be influenced by the domain of the tables and the context of the statements. It may perform better on topics and table structures that are well-represented in the training data. Complex reasoning tasks, such as multi-hop reasoning or complex numerical operations, may still pose challenges, as indicated in reference 3.\n\n2. **Population Subgroups**: The model's performance may vary across different population subgroups if the dataset contains biases or if certain subgroups are underrepresented. The references do not provide specific information on the representation of population subgroups in the TABFACT dataset, so [More Information Needed] here.\n\n3. **Complex Operations**: The model's ability to handle complex operations is crucial for its performance. Reference 4 identifies four salient groups of operations: aggregations, superlatives, comparatives and negations, and sorting pairs. The model's accuracy varies across these groups, and understanding these variations can guide further pre-training and modeling efforts.\n\n4. **Model Agreement**: As per reference 2, the model's agreement on the correct answer across multiple runs can be an indicator of its reliability. The model shows higher agreement when using counterfactual and synthetic pre-training, suggesting that these methods improve consistency in the model's predictions.\n\n5. **Error Rates and Accuracy Gains**: Reference 5 discusses the error rate across different groups of complex operations and how this impacts potential accuracy gains. The model's performance can be influenced by its ability to reduce errors in these specific groups.\n\n6. **Bias in Pre-training Data**: Reference 8 mentions that both synthetic and counterfactual datasets used for pre-training have some bias. The model's behavior will be influenced by these biases, and it is important to understand the extent to which the model relies on the tables versus the statements alone.\n\n7. **Human vs. Model Performance**: Reference 7 highlights that human accuracy remains substantially ahead of the best models, indicating that there is still room for improvement in the model's reasoning capabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's behavior will be influenced by the domain and context of the tables, the complexity of the operations required for reasoning, the consistency of the model's predictions, the biases present in the pre-training data, and the potential disparities in performance across different complex operation groups. Evaluation should be disaggregated across these factors to uncover any disparities in performance and to guide future improvements to the model."}

The choice of metrics often depends on the specific requirements of the task and the cost associated with different errors. Here are some common metrics that could be used:\n\n1. **Accuracy**: This is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of total predictions that the model gets right. While it provides a quick overview of model performance, it does not distinguish between types of errors.\n\n2. **Precision**: Precision measures the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct. It is particularly important when the cost of false positives (incorrectly verifying a false fact as true) is high.\n\n3. **Recall**: Recall measures the proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly. It is crucial when the cost of false negatives (failing to verify a true fact) is significant.\n\n4. **F1 Score**: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is used when there is a need to balance precision and recall, and there is an uneven class distribution (i.e., verifying facts is more important than refuting non-facts or vice versa).\n\n5. **ROC-AUC**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across different thresholds. A higher AUC indicates a better model at predicting true positives while minimizing false positives.\n\n6. **Confusion Matrix**: This is not a metric but a table that visualizes the performance of an algorithm. It shows the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, helping to understand the types of errors made.\n\n7. **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**: For tasks that involve ranking or multiple instance predictions, MAP can be used to evaluate how well the model ranks true facts above false ones.\n\n8. **Error Analysis**: Qualitative error analysis can help understand the nature of the mistakes the model is making, which can be critical for iterative model improvement.\n\nWhen evaluating `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact`, it is important to consider the context in which the model will be deployed. For example, in a scenario where verifying facts accurately is critical and the cost of false positives is high (such as medical or financial information), precision might be weighted more heavily. Conversely, in a scenario where it is important to capture as many true facts as possible, recall might be prioritized. The chosen metrics should reflect these priorities and help stakeholders understand the tradeoffs the model presents between different types of errors."]}

To detect the magnitude of this issue we look at 9 independent runs of each variant and analyze how many of them agree on the correct answer. Figure 5 shows that while for MASK-LM only for 24.2% of the examples all models agree on the right answer, it goes up to 55.5% when using using the counterfactual and synthetic pre-training. This suggests\n3. Salient Groups To obtain detailed information of the improvements of our approach, we manually annotated 200 random examples with the complex operations needed to answer them. We found 4 salient groups: Aggregations, superlatives, com-paratives and negations, and sort pairs into these groups via keywords in the text. To make the groups exclusive, we add a fifth case when more than one operation is needed. The accuracy of the heuristics was validated through further manual inspection of 50 samples per group.\n4. For each group within the validation set, we look at the difference in accuracy between different models. We also look at how the total error rate is divided among the groups as a way to guide the focus on pre-training tasks and modeling. The error rate defined in this way measures potential accuracy gains if all the errors in a group S were fixed:\nER(S) = |{ Errors in S}| |{ Validation examples}| .\n5. In Figure 4 we show examples in every group where our model is correct on the majority of the cases (across 9 trials), and the MASK-LM baseline is not. We also show examples that continue to produce errors after our pre-training. Many examples in this last group require multi-hop reasoning or complex numerical operations.\n6. We provide details on our experimental setup and hyper-parameter tuning in Section A. Section B and C give additional information on model and the TABFACT dataset. We give details and results regarding our column pruning approach in Section D. Full results for SQA are displayed in Section E. Section F shows the accuracy on the pre-training tasks held-out sets. Section G contains the trigger words used for identifying the salient groups in the analysis section.    8: SQA dev (first fold) and test results.\n7. In all experiments, we start with the public TAPAS checkpoint, 6 train an entailment model on the data from Section 3 and then fine-tune on the end task (TABFACT or SQA). We report the median accuracy values over 3 pre-training and 3 fine-tuning runs (9 runs in total). We estimate the error margin as half the interquartile range, that is half the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles. The hyper-parameters, how we chose them, hardware and other information to reproduce our experiments are\n8. The pre-trained models are in principle already complete table entailment predictors. Therefore it is interesting to look at their accuracy on the TABFACT evaluation set before fine-tuning them. We find that the best model trained on all the pretraining data is only two points behind the fully trained TABLE-BERT (63.8% vs 66.1%). This relatively good accuracy mostly stems from the counterfactual data.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide evaluation results of the model google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact based on the Factors and Metrics.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact.

The large variant of our model achieves a test accuracy of 75.2% when trained on counterfactual data, which is a 5.3% improvement over the LOGICALFACTCHECKER. When both counterfactual and synthetic data are used for training, the model reaches an even higher accuracy of 77.9%.\n\n2. **Model Agreement**: Our analysis indicates that model agreement on the correct answer for TABFACT has improved with our approach. For the MASK-LM baseline, only 24.2% of the examples had all models agreeing on the right answer. This agreement rate increases to 55.5% when the model is pre-trained on both counterfactual and synthetic data.\n\n3. **Salient Groups**: We identified four salient groups where the model's performance has improved: Aggregations, Superlatives, Comparatives and Negations, and a fifth group for cases requiring more than one operation. The accuracy improvements in these groups were validated through manual inspection.\n\n4. **Error Rate Analysis**: We analyzed the error rate (ER) across different salient groups to identify potential accuracy gains. The error rate is calculated as the proportion of errors within a group to the total number of validation examples.\n\n5. **Model Correctness**: Figure 4 in our reference material illustrates instances where our model correctly answers the majority of cases, in contrast to the MASK-LM baseline. It also highlights examples that remain challenging even after our pre-training, such as those requiring multi-hop reasoning or complex numerical operations.\n\n6. **Experimental Setup**: Details on our experimental setup, including hyper-parameter tuning, are provided in Section A of our reference material.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "### Model Card - Experimental Section: Explainability/Interpretability\n\nOur model, `google/tapas-large-finetuned-tabfact`, is designed to tackle the challenging task of table entailment as presented in the TABFACT dataset. This dataset consists of statements that are either entailed or refuted by tables from Wikipedia, requiring the model to perform sophisticated reasoning and higher-order operations.\n\n#### Explainability Insights\n\n1. **Counterfactual Data Augmentation**: We have employed an innovative approach to improve model performance by generating counterfactual pairs of table entailments. For each positive example, we create a minimally different refuted example, which helps the model learn to discern subtle differences that affect the truth value of a statement in the context of a table (Reference 1).\n\n2. **Model Agreement Analysis**: To address concerns about the model potentially guessing the correct answers, we conducted an analysis of model agreement across 9 independent runs. Our findings indicate a significant improvement in consistency when using counterfactual and synthetic pre-training, with 55.5% of the examples showing agreement on the correct answer among all models, compared to only 24.2% for the MASK-LM baseline (Reference 2).\n\n3. **Salient Groups and Manual Annotations**: We have identified four salient groups of complex operations necessary for answering the TABFACT statements: Aggregations, Superlatives, Comparatives and Negations. We sorted the pairs into these groups using keywords and validated the accuracy of these heuristics through manual inspection. This categorization helps in understanding the types of reasoning the model is performing and where it may need further improvement (Reference 3).\n\n4. **Performance on Counterfactual Pairs**: Our evaluation of counterfactual pairs shows that the model's ability to refute negative statements is significantly higher when these statements have a supporting mention in the table. This suggests that the presence of explicit evidence within the table is crucial for the model's performance, although even examples without supporting mentions have been found to improve accuracy on end tasks (Reference 4).\n\n5. **Error Analysis**: We have also conducted an error analysis to identify the types of examples where the model continues to struggle. Many of these challenging cases require multi-hop reasoning or complex numerical operations, which provides insight into potential areas for future model improvements (Reference 5).\n\n6. **Human vs. Model Performance**: It is important to note that there remains a substantial gap between human accuracy and model performance on the TABFACT dataset, highlighting the complexity of the task and the need for continued advancements in model capabilities (Reference 6).\n\n#### Accessibility and Usage\n\n- We have released the code and models for running TAPAS on the TabFact dataset, along with a companion paper detailing our approach (Reference 7).\n- A Colab notebook is available for users to try out predictions on TabFact, making it easier to understand the model's behavior on specific examples (Reference 7).\n- We have also provided a detailed description of the intermediate pre-training process, which can offer further insights into how the model was developed and fine-tuned (Reference 7).\n\n#### Performance Metrics\n\n- Our approach has outperformed the previous state-of-the-art on TABFACT by a significant margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods in improving model accuracy and reliability (Reference 8).\n\nIn conclusion, our efforts in explainability and interpretability focus on understanding the model's reasoning process, analyzing its consistency, and identifying areas for improvement. We believe that these insights are crucial for building trust in the model's predictions and for guiding future research in the field of table entailment."}

Specifically, it incorporates the following types of learnable input embeddings:\n\n1. Token embeddings: Standard BERT token embeddings representing the tokens in the input sequence.\n2. Position embeddings: Standard BERT position embeddings that provide information about the position of a token in the sequence.\n3. Segment embeddings: Standard BERT segment embeddings that differentiate between the statement and the table in the input.\n4. Column embeddings: These encode the column position of a cell in the table, allowing the model to understand the two-dimensional layout of the table data.\n5. Row embeddings: Similar to column embeddings, these encode the row position of a cell.\n6. Rank embeddings: For numeric columns, these embeddings encode the numeric rank of the cell within the column, which helps the model with numerical reasoning.\n\nThe input to the model consists of a concatenation of the tokenized statement and the flattened table, separated by [CLS] and [SEP] tokens. The table is processed row by row without additional separators between cells or rows.\n\nThe objective of the model is to perform binary classification to determine whether a given statement is entailed by or refuted by the information presented in a table. This is modeled as the probability of entailment P(s|T), which is computed using a single hidden layer neural network applied to the output of the [CLS] token after it has been passed through the transformer layers.\n\nThe model has been fine-tuned on the TABFACT dataset, which consists of statements that need to be verified against tables from Wikipedia. The fine-tuning process involved two novel pre-training tasks, counterfactual and synthetic, which led to state-of-the-art results on the TABFACT entailment task. The model outperformed previous models by a significant margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach and the architecture in handling the complexities of reasoning over tabular data."}
