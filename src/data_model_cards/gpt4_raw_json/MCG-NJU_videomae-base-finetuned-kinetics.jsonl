We use an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture for video self-supervised pre-training and discard the decoder during the fine-tuning phase. We take the 16-frame vanilla ViT-Base for example, and the specific architectural design for the encoder and decoder is shown in Table 8. We adopt the joint space-time attention [3,39] to better capture the high-level spatio-temporal information in the remaining tokens.

Finally, we show how we explore MAE in the video data by presenting our VideoMAE.\n6. Figure 5 shows the influence of the longer pre-training schedule on the Something-Something V2 and Kinetics-400 datasets. We find that a longer pre-training schedule brings slight gains to both datasets.\nIn the main paper, our VideoMAE is pre-trained for 800 epochs by default.\n7.

We argue that the Kinetics videos are mostly stationary and scene-related. The effect of temporal modeling is not obvious. Overall, we argue that our default designs enforce the networks to capture more useful spatiotemporal structures and therefore make VideoMAE a more challenging task, which a good self-supervised learner hunger for.\n10. In this subsection, we perform in-depth ablation studies on VideoMAE design with the default backbone of 16-frame ViT-B on Something-Something V2 (SSV2) and Kinetics-400 (K400). The specific architectures for the encoder and decoder are shown in Appendix \u00a7 6. For fine-tuning, we perform TSN [76] uniform sampling on SSV2 and dense sampling [78,23] on K400. All models share the same inference protocol, i.e., 2 clips \u00d7 3 crops on SSV2 and 5 clips \u00d7 3 crops on K400.\n11. However, when we try to transfer the pre-trained VideoMAE models to the other video datasets (e.g. from Kinetics to Something-Something), the results are slightly worse than their counterpart, which is directly pre-trained on its own target video datasets. We argue that domain shift between pre-training and target datasets could be an important issue.    High masking ratio. In VideoMAE, one core design is the extremely high masking ratio.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Model Name: MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics\n\n### Model Architecture:\nThe MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model utilizes an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture tailored for video self-supervised pre-training. The encoder and decoder are specifically designed to capture high-level spatio-temporal information in videos. The model is based on a 16-frame vanilla ViT-Base (Vision Transformer) and incorporates joint space-time attention mechanisms to enhance its understanding of video data. The decoder is discarded during the fine-tuning phase.\n\n### Training Procedures:\n- **Pre-training**: The VideoMAE model is pre-trained on the Kinetics-400 dataset for 800 epochs with a high masking ratio of 75%. During pre-training, 16 frames are sampled with a temporal stride of 4, and the batch size and base learning rate are set to 192 and 3e-4, respectively. The pre-training schedule is designed to encourage the model to learn useful spatiotemporal structures from the video data.\n- **Fine-tuning**: After pre-training, the model undergoes fine-tuning on the Kinetics-400 dataset for 100 epochs using a batch size of 128. The base learning rate for fine-tuning is set to 5e-4, with a layer decay of 0.7 and a drop path rate of 0.2. Repeated augmentation techniques are employed during fine-tuning to improve the model's generalization capabilities. Dense sampling following the Slowfast protocol is used during this phase.\n\n### Parameters:\n- **Masking Ratio**: 75% during pre-training.\n- **Batch Size**: 192 for pre-training, 128 for fine-tuning.\n- **Base Learning Rate**: 3e-4 for pre-training, 5e-4 for fine-tuning.\n- **Layer Decay**: 0.7 during fine-tuning.\n- **Drop Path Rate**: 0.2 during fine-tuning.\n- **Sampling**: 16 frames with a temporal stride of 4 for pre-training, dense sampling for fine-tuning.\n\n### Evaluation:\nFor evaluation, the model follows the inference protocol of 5 clips \u00d7 3 crops.\n\n### Important Disclaimers:\n- The model's performance may vary when transferred to other video datasets due to potential domain shifts between the pre-training and target datasets.\n- The high masking ratio is a core design feature of VideoMAE, and its impact has been investigated on the Kinetics-400 dataset.\n- The longer pre-training schedule has been shown to provide slight gains, as evidenced by experiments on the Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2 datasets.\n- The effectiveness of temporal modeling may be less pronounced in datasets like Kinetics, where videos are mostly stationary and scene-related.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on fine-tuning and pre-training, please refer to the provided [FINETUNE.md](FINETUNE.md) and [PRETRAIN.md](PRETRAIN.md) documents.\n\n[More Information Needed] for any additional specifics not covered by the provided references."}

Our VideoMAE takes the downsampled frames as inputs and uses the cube embedding to obtain video tokens. Then, we propose a simple design of tube masking with high ratio to perform MAE pre-training with an asymmetric encoderdecoder architecture. Our backbone uses the vanilla ViT with joint space-time attention.", "Tube masking with extremely high ratios. First, temporal redundancy is a factor affecting Video-MAE design. We find that VideoMAE is in favor of extremely high masking ratios (e.g. 90% to 95%) compared with the ImageMAE. Video information density is much lower than images, and we expect a high ratio to increase the reconstruction difficulty. This high masking ratio is helpful to mitigate the information leakage during masked modeling and make masked video reconstruction a meaningful self-supervised", "Temporal downsampling. According to the above analysis on temporal redundancy over consecutive frames, we propose to use the strided temporal sampling strategy to perform more efficient video pre-training. Formally, one video clip consisting of t consecutive frames is first randomly sampled from the original video V . We then use temporal sampling to compress the clip to T frames, each of which contains H \u00d7 W \u00d7 3 pixels. In experiments, the stride \u03c4 is set to 4 and 2 on Kinetics and Something-Something,", "In this section, we first revisit ImageMAE [31]. Then we analyze the characteristics of video data.

So for some cubes with no or small motion (e.g., finger cube in 4th row of Figure 2 (d)), we can not find the spatiotemporal corresponding content in all frames. In this way, it would encourage our VideoMAE to reason over high-level semantics to recover these totally missing cubes.

To relieve the above issues in video masked modeling, we make the customized design in our VideoMAE, and the overall pipeline is shown in Figure 1. Our VideoMAE takes the downsampled frames as inputs and uses the cube embedding to obtain video tokens. Then, we propose a simple design of tube masking with high ratio to perform MAE pre-training with an asymmetric encoderdecoder architecture. Our backbone uses the vanilla ViT with joint space-time attention.\n2. Tube masking with extremely high ratios. First, temporal redundancy is a factor affecting Video-MAE design. We find that VideoMAE is in favor of extremely high masking ratios (e.g. 90% to 95%) compared with the ImageMAE. Video information density is much lower than images, and we expect a high ratio to increase the reconstruction difficulty. This high masking ratio is helpful to mitigate the information leakage during masked modeling and make masked video reconstruction a meaningful self-supervised\n3. Temporal downsampling. According to the above analysis on temporal redundancy over consecutive frames, we propose to use the strided temporal sampling strategy to perform more efficient video pre-training. Formally, one video clip consisting of t consecutive frames is first randomly sampled from the original video V . We then use temporal sampling to compress the clip to T frames, each of which contains H \u00d7 W \u00d7 3 pixels. In experiments, the stride \u03c4 is set to 4 and 2 on Kinetics and Something-Something,\n4. In this section, we first revisit ImageMAE [31]. Then we analyze the characteristics of video data. Finally, we show how we explore MAE in the video data by presenting our VideoMAE.\n5. temporal neighbors of masked cubes are always masked. So for some cubes with no or small motion (e.g., finger cube in 4th row of Figure 2 (d)), we can not find the spatiotemporal corresponding content in all frames. In this way, it would encourage our VideoMAE to reason over high-level semantics to recover these totally missing cubes. This simple strategy can alleviate the information leakage for cubes with no or negligible motion, and turns out to be effective in practice for masked video pre-training.\n6. We provide pre-trained and fine-tuned models in [MODEL_ZOO.md](MODEL_ZOO.md).\n7. The fine-tuning instruction is in [FINETUNE.md](FINETUNE.md).\n8. In this subsection, we perform in-depth ablation studies on VideoMAE design with the default backbone of 16-frame ViT-B on Something-Something V2 (SSV2) and Kinetics-400 (K400). The specific architectures for the encoder and decoder are shown in Appendix \u00a7 6. For fine-tuning, we perform TSN [76] uniform sampling on SSV2 and dense sampling [78,23] on K400.

During this phase, the model's weights are updated to minimize the loss on your specific task. You can choose to fine-tune all layers of the model or only the higher-level ones while keeping the lower-level weights frozen.\n\n7. **Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate the model on a validation set to monitor its performance and prevent overfitting. Use metrics relevant to your task, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.\n\n8. **Iteration**: Based on the performance on the validation set, you may need to iterate on steps 4-7, adjusting hyperparameters, adding regularization, or augmenting your dataset to improve the model's performance.\n\n9. **Deployment**: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, you can deploy it for inference on new, unseen video data.\n\nBy fine-tuning the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model on a task-specific dataset, you leverage the pre-learned video representations and adapt them to your particular domain, potentially achieving high accuracy with less data and training time compared to training a model from scratch.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is a machine learning model that has been fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset, which is a large-scale, high-quality dataset of YouTube video URLs with a diverse range of human activities.

While I do not have real-time access to databases or user reports that might list current issues, I can provide some general insights into the types of issues that can arise from models like this one:\n\n1. **Generalization to Unseen Data**: One common issue with models fine-tuned on specific datasets like Kinetics is that they may not generalize well to videos that are significantly different from those in the training set. This can result in lower performance when the model is applied to videos from different domains or with different characteristics.\n\n2. **Overfitting**: If the fine-tuning process is not carefully regularized, the model might overfit to the Kinetics dataset, meaning it would perform exceptionally well on this dataset but poorly on others. This is a common challenge in machine learning and can lead to a model that is not robust in real-world applications.\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency**: Video understanding models are often computationally intensive due to the need to process multiple frames and understand temporal dynamics. Users may encounter issues with the model's efficiency, especially when deploying it on less powerful hardware or attempting to use it in real-time applications.\n\n4. **Bias in Data**: The Kinetics dataset, like many datasets, may contain biases that can be inadvertently learned by the model. These biases could be in the form of overrepresentation of certain types of activities, backgrounds, or demographics, which can affect the model's fairness and its ability to make unbiased predictions.\n\n5. **Licensing and Ethical Concerns**: Depending on how the Kinetics dataset was collected and the permissions associated with the videos, there might be licensing or ethical concerns related to privacy and the use of the data, which could limit the model's application in certain contexts.\n\n6. **Robustness to Adversarial Attacks**: Machine learning models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, where small, carefully crafted perturbations to the input data can lead to incorrect predictions. The robustness of the model to such attacks is an important consideration, especially for security-sensitive applications.\n\n7. **Version Compatibility**: As machine learning frameworks and libraries evolve, there can be compatibility issues with newer versions. Users may encounter problems if the model was trained with a specific version of a library that is no longer supported or has undergone significant changes.\n\nTo get the most accurate and up-to-date information on known issues with the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model, it would be best to consult the official repository, documentation, or forums where the model is hosted or discussed. Developers and users often report issues, bugs, and limitations in these venues, and maintainers may also provide updates and patches to address reported problems.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is a machine learning model that has been fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset for video understanding tasks. While the model itself is a powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting video content, there are several foreseeable harms that could arise from its use:\n\n1. **Privacy Violations**: If the model is used to analyze videos containing private or sensitive information without consent, it could lead to privacy violations. This is particularly concerning if the videos include identifiable individuals who have not agreed to have their likeness or actions analyzed by AI.\n\n2. **Bias and Discrimination**: The model may inherit or amplify biases present in the training data. If the Kinetics dataset contains biases related to race, gender, age, or any other characteristic, the model's predictions could unfairly discriminate against certain groups, leading to biased outcomes in applications such as surveillance or content moderation.\n\n3. **Misuse in Surveillance**: The model's capabilities could be exploited for mass surveillance purposes, potentially by authoritarian regimes or unscrupulous corporations, to monitor individuals without their knowledge or consent, infringing on civil liberties and human rights.\n\n4. **Deepfake Generation**: Advanced video understanding models could potentially be used to create more convincing deepfakes, which are synthetic media where a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. This can be used for misinformation, fraud, or to discredit individuals.\n\n5. **Content Manipulation**: The model could be used to manipulate video content, such as removing or adding elements to deceive viewers, which could have serious implications for journalism, legal evidence, and public trust.\n\n6. **Intellectual Property Infringement**: If the model is used to analyze and reproduce copyrighted material, it could lead to intellectual property infringement, affecting content creators and rights holders.\n\n7. **Over-reliance and Erosion of Human Skills**: An over-reliance on automated video analysis could lead to a decline in human expertise in areas such as video editing, content creation, and critical analysis, as these skills may be perceived as less valuable when a machine can perform similar tasks.\n\n8. **Security Risks**: If the model or the systems using it are not properly secured, they could be vulnerable to hacking and other cyber attacks, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation of the model's outputs.\n\n9. **Unintended Consequences**: As with any AI system, there may be unforeseen consequences of deploying the model in real-world scenarios, which could range from technical failures to negative social impacts.\n\nTo mitigate these harms, it is important for developers and users of the model to implement ethical guidelines, ensure transparency, obtain necessary consents, and consider the broader societal implications of the technology's deployment. Additionally, ongoing research into fairness, accountability, and security in AI is crucial to address these challenges.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is a machine learning model designed for video understanding tasks, specifically fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset, which is a large-scale, high-quality dataset of YouTube video URLs with a diverse range of human activities. Despite its capabilities, there are several common misunderstandings related to the model:\n\n1. **Purpose Limitation**: Some may believe that this model can understand any type of video content with equal accuracy. However, its performance is optimized for the types of activities and scenarios present in the Kinetics dataset. It may not perform as well on videos with content that is significantly different from the dataset it was trained on.\n\n2. **Data Privacy**: There might be a misconception that the model has access to private videos or can analyze personal data without consent. In reality, the model has been trained on publicly available data, and it does not have the ability to access private videos unless they are provided to it during its application.\n\n3. **Autonomous Learning**: Another misunderstanding is that the model can continue to learn and improve on its own after deployment. While some models can be updated with new data, this particular model does not learn autonomously after its initial training and fine-tuning unless it is explicitly retrained with new data.\n\n4. **Human-Level Understanding**: People might expect the model to understand videos with the same depth and context as a human viewer. However, while the model can recognize and classify actions, it does not possess the same level of comprehension, emotional intelligence, or contextual awareness as a human.\n\n5. **Generalization to Other Tasks**: It's often assumed that a model fine-tuned for a specific task, like video action recognition, can easily be applied to other related tasks, such as object detection or scene recognition. However, the model's architecture and training are specialized, and it may require significant adaptation or retraining to perform well on different tasks.\n\n6. **Real-Time Processing**: There may be an expectation that the model can process and understand videos in real-time. Depending on the computational resources available and the complexity of the videos, real-time analysis might not be feasible without significant optimization or hardware acceleration.\n\n7. **Error-Free Performance**: Some users might believe that the model is infallible. However, like all machine learning models, it is subject to errors and its performance can vary depending on the quality and nature of the input data.\n\nUnderstanding these limitations and characteristics is crucial for effectively deploying and utilizing the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model in real-world applications.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is a machine learning model designed for video understanding tasks, specifically fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset. While it may excel in various applications, there are several technical limitations to consider:\n\n1. **Computational Resources**: Video processing is inherently resource-intensive due to the high dimensionality of the data (frames, resolution, color channels, etc.). This model may require significant computational power, including a high-end GPU for efficient operation, which could be a limitation for users without access to such resources.\n\n2. **Generalization**: While fine-tuning on the Kinetics dataset allows the model to perform well on similar types of videos, it may not generalize as effectively to videos with different characteristics or from different domains. This could limit its applicability in diverse real-world scenarios.\n\n3. **Data Bias**: The Kinetics dataset, like any dataset, may contain biases that can be learned by the model. These biases could affect the model's performance and fairness when applied to a broader range of videos.\n\n4. **Memory Constraints**: Processing video data can be memory-intensive, especially for long videos or high-resolution content. The model may encounter memory limitations, which could necessitate reducing the video quality or trimming the content, potentially impacting the analysis's accuracy.\n\n5. **Inference Speed**: Depending on the complexity of the model and the size of the input videos, the inference speed may be slower than desired for real-time applications. This could limit its use in scenarios where immediate video analysis is required.\n\n6. **Adaptability**: The model's architecture and parameters are optimized for the task it was fine-tuned on. Adapting the model to different video understanding tasks may require additional fine-tuning or even architectural changes, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.\n\n7. **Robustness**: The model may be sensitive to variations in video quality, such as lighting changes, occlusions, or camera motion. This sensitivity can lead to decreased performance in less-than-ideal conditions.\n\n8. **Update and Maintenance**: As with any machine learning model, keeping the model up-to-date with the latest algorithms and datasets is crucial for maintaining its performance. This requires ongoing maintenance and potential retraining, which can be a limitation for users without the expertise or resources to do so.\n\n9. **Licensing and Usage Restrictions**: Depending on the licensing of the model and the Kinetics dataset, there may be restrictions on how the model can be used, particularly in commercial applications. Users need to be aware of and comply with these restrictions.\n\n10. **Interpretability**: Video understanding models can be complex, making it difficult to interpret their predictions. This lack of interpretability can be a limitation in applications where understanding the model's decision-making process is important.\n\nThese technical limitations highlight the importance of considering the specific requirements and constraints of the intended application when choosing to use the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics, like any machine learning model, has sociotechnical limitations that stem from both its technical design and the social context in which it operates. Here are some potential limitations:\n\n1. **Data Bias and Representation**: The model's performance is highly dependent on the data it was trained on. If the Kinetics dataset, which it was fine-tuned on, lacks diversity in terms of the activities represented, the demographics of the people in the videos, or the contexts in which actions occur, the model may not generalize well to real-world scenarios that differ from the training data. This can lead to biased or inaccurate predictions for underrepresented groups or activities.\n\n2. **Ethical Considerations**: The use of video recognition models raises privacy concerns. The model could potentially be used in surveillance systems or for analyzing videos without the consent of the individuals being recorded, leading to ethical dilemmas regarding privacy and consent.\n\n3. **Misuse and Abuse**: There is a risk that the model could be used for malicious purposes, such as creating deepfakes, conducting unauthorized surveillance, or other activities that infringe on personal rights and freedoms.\n\n4. **Interpretability and Transparency**: Machine learning models can be black boxes, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at certain predictions. This lack of transparency can be a barrier to trust and accountability, especially in sensitive applications.\n\n5. **Dependence on Technical Infrastructure**: The model's deployment and operation require significant computational resources, which may not be available or affordable in all contexts, potentially limiting its accessibility and widening the digital divide.\n\n6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be legal restrictions on the use of AI in certain contexts, such as GDPR in the European Union, which includes regulations on automated decision-making and profiling.\n\n7. **Maintenance and Updating**: The model may become outdated as new types of videos or actions emerge. Continuous updating and maintenance are required to keep the model relevant, which can be resource-intensive.\n\n8. **Error Propagation**: In a system where this model's outputs are used for further decision-making, errors can propagate and amplify, leading to potentially significant consequences, especially in critical applications like healthcare or law enforcement.\n\n9. **Accessibility**: The model's interface and outputs may not be accessible to all users, particularly those with disabilities, which can limit its usability and inclusiveness.\n\n10. **Societal Impact**: The widespread adoption of video recognition technology can have broader societal implications, such as changing norms around surveillance, impacting labor markets (e.g., by automating tasks previously done by humans), and influencing social interactions.\n\nAddressing these sociotechnical limitations requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving not only improvements in the technical aspects of the model but also careful consideration of the ethical, legal, and social dimensions of AI deployment."]}

{"question": "bias_risks_limitations", "chain": "retrieval", "prompt": ["As of my last update, the model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is a machine learning model designed for video understanding tasks, specifically fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset. While I do not have real-time access to databases or user reports that might list current issues, I can provide some general insights into the types of issues that can arise from models like this one:\n\n1. **Generalization to Unseen Data**: One common issue with models fine-tuned on specific datasets like Kinetics is that they may not generalize well to videos that are significantly different from those in the training set. This can result in lower performance when the model is applied to videos from different domains or with different characteristics.\n\n2. **Overfitting**: If the fine-tuning process is not carefully regularized, the model might overfit to the Kinetics dataset, meaning it would perform exceptionally well on this dataset but poorly on others. This is a common challenge in machine learning and can lead to a model that is not robust in real-world applications.\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency**: Video understanding models are often computationally intensive due to the need to process multiple frames and understand temporal dynamics. Users may encounter issues with the model's efficiency, especially when deploying it on less powerful hardware or attempting to use it in real-time applications.\n\n4. **Bias in Data**: The Kinetics dataset, like many datasets, may contain biases that can be inadvertently learned by the model. These biases could be in the form of overrepresentation of certain types of activities, backgrounds, or demographics, which can affect the model's fairness and its ability to make unbiased predictions.\n\n5. **Licensing and Ethical Concerns**: Depending on how the Kinetics dataset was collected and the permissions associated with the videos, there might be licensing or ethical concerns related to privacy and the use of the data, which could limit the model's application in certain contexts.\n\n6. **Robustness to Adversarial Attacks**: Machine learning models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, where small, carefully crafted perturbations to the input data can lead to incorrect predictions. The robustness of the model to such attacks is an important consideration, especially for security-sensitive applications.\n\n7. **Version Compatibility**: As machine learning frameworks and libraries evolve, there can be compatibility issues with newer versions. Users may encounter problems if the model was trained with a specific version of a library that is no longer supported or has undergone significant changes.\n\nTo get the most accurate and up-to-date information on known issues with the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model, it would be best to consult the official repository, documentation, or forums where the model is hosted or discussed. Developers and users often report issues, bugs, and limitations in these venues, and maintainers may also provide updates and patches to address reported problems.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is a machine learning model that has been fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset for video understanding tasks. While the model itself is a powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting video content, there are several foreseeable harms that could arise from its use:\n\n1. **Privacy Violations**: If the model is used to analyze videos containing private or sensitive information without consent, it could lead to privacy violations. This is particularly concerning if the videos include identifiable individuals who have not agreed to have their likeness or actions analyzed by AI.\n\n2. **Bias and Discrimination**: The model may inherit or amplify biases present in the training data. If the Kinetics dataset contains biases related to race, gender, age, or any other characteristic, the model's predictions could unfairly discriminate against certain groups, leading to biased outcomes in applications such as surveillance or content moderation.\n\n3. **Misuse in Surveillance**: The model's capabilities could be exploited for mass surveillance purposes, potentially by authoritarian regimes or unscrupulous corporations, to monitor individuals without their knowledge or consent, infringing on civil liberties and human rights.\n\n4. **Deepfake Generation**: Advanced video understanding models could potentially be used to create more convincing deepfakes, which are synthetic media where a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. This can be used for misinformation, fraud, or to discredit individuals.\n\n5. **Content Manipulation**: The model could be used to manipulate video content, such as removing or adding elements to deceive viewers, which could have serious implications for journalism, legal evidence, and public trust.\n\n6. **Intellectual Property Infringement**: If the model is used to analyze and reproduce copyrighted material, it could lead to intellectual property infringement, affecting content creators and rights holders.\n\n7. **Over-reliance and Erosion of Human Skills**: An over-reliance on automated video analysis could lead to a decline in human expertise in areas such as video editing, content creation, and critical analysis, as these skills may be perceived as less valuable when a machine can perform similar tasks.\n\n8. **Security Risks**: If the model or the systems using it are not properly secured, they could be vulnerable to hacking and other cyber attacks, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation of the model's outputs.\n\n9. **Unintended Consequences**: As with any AI system, there may be unforeseen consequences of deploying the model in real-world scenarios, which could range from technical failures to negative social impacts.\n\nTo mitigate these harms, it is important for developers and users of the model to implement ethical guidelines, ensure transparency, obtain necessary consents, and consider the broader societal implications of the technology's deployment. Additionally, ongoing research into fairness, accountability, and security in AI is crucial to address these challenges.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is a machine learning model designed for video understanding tasks, specifically fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset, which is a large-scale, high-quality dataset of YouTube video URLs with a diverse range of human activities. Despite its capabilities, there are several common misunderstandings related to the model:\n\n1. **Purpose Limitation**: Some may believe that this model can understand any type of video content with equal accuracy. However, its performance is optimized for the types of activities and scenarios present in the Kinetics dataset. It may not perform as well on videos with content that is significantly different from the dataset it was trained on.\n\n2. **Data Privacy**: There might be a misconception that the model has access to private videos or can analyze personal data without consent. In reality, the model has been trained on publicly available data, and it does not have the ability to access private videos unless they are provided to it during its application.\n\n3. **Autonomous Learning**: Another misunderstanding is that the model can continue to learn and improve on its own after deployment. While some models can be updated with new data, this particular model does not learn autonomously after its initial training and fine-tuning unless it is explicitly retrained with new data.\n\n4. **Human-Level Understanding**: People might expect the model to understand videos with the same depth and context as a human viewer. However, while the model can recognize and classify actions, it does not possess the same level of comprehension, emotional intelligence, or contextual awareness as a human.\n\n5. **Generalization to Other Tasks**: It's often assumed that a model fine-tuned for a specific task, like video action recognition, can easily be applied to other related tasks, such as object detection or scene recognition. However, the model's architecture and training are specialized, and it may require significant adaptation or retraining to perform well on different tasks.\n\n6. **Real-Time Processing**: There may be an expectation that the model can process and understand videos in real-time. Depending on the computational resources available and the complexity of the videos, real-time analysis might not be feasible without significant optimization or hardware acceleration.\n\n7. **Error-Free Performance**: Some users might believe that the model is infallible. However, like all machine learning models, it is subject to errors and its performance can vary depending on the quality and nature of the input data.\n\nUnderstanding these limitations and characteristics is crucial for effectively deploying and utilizing the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model in real-world applications.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is a machine learning model designed for video understanding tasks, specifically fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset. While it may excel in various applications, there are several technical limitations to consider:\n\n1. **Computational Resources**: Video processing is inherently resource-intensive due to the high dimensionality of the data (frames, resolution, color channels, etc.). This model may require significant computational power, including a high-end GPU for efficient operation, which could be a limitation for users without access to such resources.\n\n2. **Generalization**: While fine-tuning on the Kinetics dataset allows the model to perform well on similar types of videos, it may not generalize as effectively to videos with different characteristics or from different domains. This could limit its applicability in diverse real-world scenarios.\n\n3. **Data Bias**: The Kinetics dataset, like any dataset, may contain biases that can be learned by the model. These biases could affect the model's performance and fairness when applied to a broader range of videos.\n\n4. **Memory Constraints**: Processing video data can be memory-intensive, especially for long videos or high-resolution content. The model may encounter memory limitations, which could necessitate reducing the video quality or trimming the content, potentially impacting the analysis's accuracy.\n\n5. **Inference Speed**: Depending on the complexity of the model and the size of the input videos, the inference speed may be slower than desired for real-time applications. This could limit its use in scenarios where immediate video analysis is required.\n\n6. **Adaptability**: The model's architecture and parameters are optimized for the task it was fine-tuned on. Adapting the model to different video understanding tasks may require additional fine-tuning or even architectural changes, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.\n\n7. **Robustness**: The model may be sensitive to variations in video quality, such as lighting changes, occlusions, or camera motion. This sensitivity can lead to decreased performance in less-than-ideal conditions.\n\n8. **Update and Maintenance**: As with any machine learning model, keeping the model up-to-date with the latest algorithms and datasets is crucial for maintaining its performance. This requires ongoing maintenance and potential retraining, which can be a limitation for users without the expertise or resources to do so.\n\n9. **Licensing and Usage Restrictions**: Depending on the licensing of the model and the Kinetics dataset, there may be restrictions on how the model can be used, particularly in commercial applications. Users need to be aware of and comply with these restrictions.\n\n10. **Interpretability**: Video understanding models can be complex, making it difficult to interpret their predictions. This lack of interpretability can be a limitation in applications where understanding the model's decision-making process is important.\n\nThese technical limitations highlight the importance of considering the specific requirements and constraints of the intended application when choosing to use the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics, like any machine learning model, has sociotechnical limitations that stem from both its technical design and the social context in which it operates. Here are some potential limitations:\n\n1. **Data Bias and Representation**: The model's performance is highly dependent on the data it was trained on. If the Kinetics dataset, which it was fine-tuned on, lacks diversity in terms of the activities represented, the demographics of the people in the videos, or the contexts in which actions occur, the model may not generalize well to real-world scenarios that differ from the training data. This can lead to biased or inaccurate predictions for underrepresented groups or activities.\n\n2. **Ethical Considerations**: The use of video recognition models raises privacy concerns. The model could potentially be used in surveillance systems or for analyzing videos without the consent of the individuals being recorded, leading to ethical dilemmas regarding privacy and consent.\n\n3. **Misuse and Abuse**: There is a risk that the model could be used for malicious purposes, such as creating deepfakes, conducting unauthorized surveillance, or other activities that infringe on personal rights and freedoms.\n\n4. **Interpretability and Transparency**: Machine learning models can be black boxes, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at certain predictions. This lack of transparency can be a barrier to trust and accountability, especially in sensitive applications.\n\n5. **Dependence on Technical Infrastructure**: The model's deployment and operation require significant computational resources, which may not be available or affordable in all contexts, potentially limiting its accessibility and widening the digital divide.\n\n6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be legal restrictions on the use of AI in certain contexts, such as GDPR in the European Union, which includes regulations on automated decision-making and profiling.\n\n7. **Maintenance and Updating**: The model may become outdated as new types of videos or actions emerge. Continuous updating and maintenance are required to keep the model relevant, which can be resource-intensive.\n\n8. **Error Propagation**: In a system where this model's outputs are used for further decision-making, errors can propagate and amplify, leading to potentially significant consequences, especially in critical applications like healthcare or law enforcement.\n\n9. **Accessibility**: The model's interface and outputs may not be accessible to all users, particularly those with disabilities, which can limit its usability and inclusiveness.\n\n10. **Societal Impact**: The widespread adoption of video recognition technology can have broader societal implications, such as changing norms around surveillance, impacting labor markets (e.g., by automating tasks previously done by humans), and influencing social interactions.\n\nAddressing these sociotechnical limitations requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving not only improvements in the technical aspects of the model but also careful consideration of the ethical, legal, and social dimensions of AI deployment."], "answer": ["In this section, we add the analysis of model results.

While I do not have real-time access to databases or user reports that might list current issues, I can provide some general insights into the types of issues that can arise from models like this one:\n\n1. **Generalization to Unseen Data**: One common issue with models fine-tuned on specific datasets like Kinetics is that they may not generalize well to videos that are significantly different from those in the training set. This can result in lower performance when the model is applied to videos from different domains or with different characteristics.\n\n2. **Overfitting**: If the fine-tuning process is not carefully regularized, the model might overfit to the Kinetics dataset, meaning it would perform exceptionally well on this dataset but poorly on others. This is a common challenge in machine learning and can lead to a model that is not robust in real-world applications.\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency**: Video understanding models are often computationally intensive due to the need to process multiple frames and understand temporal dynamics. Users may encounter issues with the model's efficiency, especially when deploying it on less powerful hardware or attempting to use it in real-time applications.\n\n4. **Bias in Data**: The Kinetics dataset, like many datasets, may contain biases that can be inadvertently learned by the model. These biases could be in the form of overrepresentation of certain types of activities, backgrounds, or demographics, which can affect the model's fairness and its ability to make unbiased predictions.\n\n5. **Licensing and Ethical Concerns**: Depending on how the Kinetics dataset was collected and the permissions associated with the videos, there might be licensing or ethical concerns related to privacy and the use of the data, which could limit the model's application in certain contexts.\n\n6. **Robustness to Adversarial Attacks**: Machine learning models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks, where small, carefully crafted perturbations to the input data can lead to incorrect predictions. The robustness of the model to such attacks is an important consideration, especially for security-sensitive applications.\n\n7. **Version Compatibility**: As machine learning frameworks and libraries evolve, there can be compatibility issues with newer versions. Users may encounter problems if the model was trained with a specific version of a library that is no longer supported or has undergone significant changes.\n\nTo get the most accurate and up-to-date information on known issues with the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model, it would be best to consult the official repository, documentation, or forums where the model is hosted or discussed. Developers and users often report issues, bugs, and limitations in these venues, and maintainers may also provide updates and patches to address reported problems.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is a machine learning model that has been fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset for video understanding tasks. While the model itself is a powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting video content, there are several foreseeable harms that could arise from its use:\n\n1. **Privacy Violations**: If the model is used to analyze videos containing private or sensitive information without consent, it could lead to privacy violations. This is particularly concerning if the videos include identifiable individuals who have not agreed to have their likeness or actions analyzed by AI.\n\n2. **Bias and Discrimination**: The model may inherit or amplify biases present in the training data. If the Kinetics dataset contains biases related to race, gender, age, or any other characteristic, the model's predictions could unfairly discriminate against certain groups, leading to biased outcomes in applications such as surveillance or content moderation.\n\n3. **Misuse in Surveillance**: The model's capabilities could be exploited for mass surveillance purposes, potentially by authoritarian regimes or unscrupulous corporations, to monitor individuals without their knowledge or consent, infringing on civil liberties and human rights.\n\n4. **Deepfake Generation**: Advanced video understanding models could potentially be used to create more convincing deepfakes, which are synthetic media where a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. This can be used for misinformation, fraud, or to discredit individuals.\n\n5. **Content Manipulation**: The model could be used to manipulate video content, such as removing or adding elements to deceive viewers, which could have serious implications for journalism, legal evidence, and public trust.\n\n6. **Intellectual Property Infringement**: If the model is used to analyze and reproduce copyrighted material, it could lead to intellectual property infringement, affecting content creators and rights holders.\n\n7. **Over-reliance and Erosion of Human Skills**: An over-reliance on automated video analysis could lead to a decline in human expertise in areas such as video editing, content creation, and critical analysis, as these skills may be perceived as less valuable when a machine can perform similar tasks.\n\n8. **Security Risks**: If the model or the systems using it are not properly secured, they could be vulnerable to hacking and other cyber attacks, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation of the model's outputs.\n\n9. **Unintended Consequences**: As with any AI system, there may be unforeseen consequences of deploying the model in real-world scenarios, which could range from technical failures to negative social impacts.\n\nTo mitigate these harms, it is important for developers and users of the model to implement ethical guidelines, ensure transparency, obtain necessary consents, and consider the broader societal implications of the technology's deployment. Additionally, ongoing research into fairness, accountability, and security in AI is crucial to address these challenges.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is a machine learning model designed for video understanding tasks, specifically fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset, which is a large-scale, high-quality dataset of YouTube video URLs with a diverse range of human activities. Despite its capabilities, there are several common misunderstandings related to the model:\n\n1. **Purpose Limitation**: Some may believe that this model can understand any type of video content with equal accuracy. However, its performance is optimized for the types of activities and scenarios present in the Kinetics dataset. It may not perform as well on videos with content that is significantly different from the dataset it was trained on.\n\n2. **Data Privacy**: There might be a misconception that the model has access to private videos or can analyze personal data without consent. In reality, the model has been trained on publicly available data, and it does not have the ability to access private videos unless they are provided to it during its application.\n\n3. **Autonomous Learning**: Another misunderstanding is that the model can continue to learn and improve on its own after deployment. While some models can be updated with new data, this particular model does not learn autonomously after its initial training and fine-tuning unless it is explicitly retrained with new data.\n\n4. **Human-Level Understanding**: People might expect the model to understand videos with the same depth and context as a human viewer. However, while the model can recognize and classify actions, it does not possess the same level of comprehension, emotional intelligence, or contextual awareness as a human.\n\n5. **Generalization to Other Tasks**: It's often assumed that a model fine-tuned for a specific task, like video action recognition, can easily be applied to other related tasks, such as object detection or scene recognition. However, the model's architecture and training are specialized, and it may require significant adaptation or retraining to perform well on different tasks.\n\n6. **Real-Time Processing**: There may be an expectation that the model can process and understand videos in real-time. Depending on the computational resources available and the complexity of the videos, real-time analysis might not be feasible without significant optimization or hardware acceleration.\n\n7. **Error-Free Performance**: Some users might believe that the model is infallible. However, like all machine learning models, it is subject to errors and its performance can vary depending on the quality and nature of the input data.\n\nUnderstanding these limitations and characteristics is crucial for effectively deploying and utilizing the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model in real-world applications.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is a machine learning model designed for video understanding tasks, specifically fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset. While it may excel in various applications, there are several technical limitations to consider:\n\n1. **Computational Resources**: Video processing is inherently resource-intensive due to the high dimensionality of the data (frames, resolution, color channels, etc.). This model may require significant computational power, including a high-end GPU for efficient operation, which could be a limitation for users without access to such resources.\n\n2. **Generalization**: While fine-tuning on the Kinetics dataset allows the model to perform well on similar types of videos, it may not generalize as effectively to videos with different characteristics or from different domains. This could limit its applicability in diverse real-world scenarios.\n\n3. **Data Bias**: The Kinetics dataset, like any dataset, may contain biases that can be learned by the model. These biases could affect the model's performance and fairness when applied to a broader range of videos.\n\n4. **Memory Constraints**: Processing video data can be memory-intensive, especially for long videos or high-resolution content. The model may encounter memory limitations, which could necessitate reducing the video quality or trimming the content, potentially impacting the analysis's accuracy.\n\n5. **Inference Speed**: Depending on the complexity of the model and the size of the input videos, the inference speed may be slower than desired for real-time applications. This could limit its use in scenarios where immediate video analysis is required.\n\n6. **Adaptability**: The model's architecture and parameters are optimized for the task it was fine-tuned on. Adapting the model to different video understanding tasks may require additional fine-tuning or even architectural changes, which can be a complex and time-consuming process.\n\n7. **Robustness**: The model may be sensitive to variations in video quality, such as lighting changes, occlusions, or camera motion. This sensitivity can lead to decreased performance in less-than-ideal conditions.\n\n8. **Update and Maintenance**: As with any machine learning model, keeping the model up-to-date with the latest algorithms and datasets is crucial for maintaining its performance. This requires ongoing maintenance and potential retraining, which can be a limitation for users without the expertise or resources to do so.\n\n9. **Licensing and Usage Restrictions**: Depending on the licensing of the model and the Kinetics dataset, there may be restrictions on how the model can be used, particularly in commercial applications. Users need to be aware of and comply with these restrictions.\n\n10. **Interpretability**: Video understanding models can be complex, making it difficult to interpret their predictions. This lack of interpretability can be a limitation in applications where understanding the model's decision-making process is important.\n\nThese technical limitations highlight the importance of considering the specific requirements and constraints of the intended application when choosing to use the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics, like any machine learning model, has sociotechnical limitations that stem from both its technical design and the social context in which it operates. Here are some potential limitations:\n\n1. **Data Bias and Representation**: The model's performance is highly dependent on the data it was trained on. If the Kinetics dataset, which it was fine-tuned on, lacks diversity in terms of the activities represented, the demographics of the people in the videos, or the contexts in which actions occur, the model may not generalize well to real-world scenarios that differ from the training data. This can lead to biased or inaccurate predictions for underrepresented groups or activities.\n\n2. **Ethical Considerations**: The use of video recognition models raises privacy concerns. The model could potentially be used in surveillance systems or for analyzing videos without the consent of the individuals being recorded, leading to ethical dilemmas regarding privacy and consent.\n\n3. **Misuse and Abuse**: There is a risk that the model could be used for malicious purposes, such as creating deepfakes, conducting unauthorized surveillance, or other activities that infringe on personal rights and freedoms.\n\n4. **Interpretability and Transparency**: Machine learning models can be black boxes, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at certain predictions. This lack of transparency can be a barrier to trust and accountability, especially in sensitive applications.\n\n5. **Dependence on Technical Infrastructure**: The model's deployment and operation require significant computational resources, which may not be available or affordable in all contexts, potentially limiting its accessibility and widening the digital divide.\n\n6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be legal restrictions on the use of AI in certain contexts, such as GDPR in the European Union, which includes regulations on automated decision-making and profiling.\n\n7. **Maintenance and Updating**: The model may become outdated as new types of videos or actions emerge. Continuous updating and maintenance are required to keep the model relevant, which can be resource-intensive.\n\n8. **Error Propagation**: In a system where this model's outputs are used for further decision-making, errors can propagate and amplify, leading to potentially significant consequences, especially in critical applications like healthcare or law enforcement.\n\n9. **Accessibility**: The model's interface and outputs may not be accessible to all users, particularly those with disabilities, which can limit its usability and inclusiveness.\n\n10. **Societal Impact**: The widespread adoption of video recognition technology can have broader societal implications, such as changing norms around surveillance, impacting labor markets (e.g., by automating tasks previously done by humans), and influencing social interactions.\n\nAddressing these sociotechnical limitations requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving not only improvements in the technical aspects of the model but also careful consideration of the ethical, legal, and social dimensions of AI deployment."], "answer": ["gap on K400 is lower than one on SSV2.

You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references, here are the recommendations with respect to the foreseeable issues about the model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics:\n\n1. **Domain Shift**: The model may experience a performance drop when transferred to datasets that are significantly different from the Kinetics dataset it was trained on. To mitigate this, it is recommended to consider domain adaptation techniques when applying the model to new datasets or to fine-tune the model on a subset of the target dataset to better capture the domain-specific features.\n\n2. **Data Quality Over Quantity**: The findings suggest that data quality is more important than data quantity in self-supervised video pre-training (SSVP) when there is a domain shift. Therefore, curating high-quality datasets that are more representative of the target domain should be prioritized over simply increasing the size of the training set.\n\n3. **Temporal Modeling**: Since Kinetics videos are mostly stationary and scene-related, the effect of temporal modeling is not as pronounced. For datasets with more dynamic content, it may be beneficial to explore alternative temporal modeling techniques that can better capture motion and changes over time.\n\n4. **Masking Ratio**: The model uses an extremely high masking ratio during pre-training. While this has shown to be effective, it is important to investigate the impact of different masking ratios on various datasets, as the optimal ratio may vary depending on the characteristics of the data.\n\n5. **Sampling Methods**: The model uses dense sampling for Kinetics-400 and different sampling methods for other datasets. It is recommended to evaluate the impact of different sampling strategies on the model's performance for various types of video content and consider adapting the sampling method to the specific characteristics of the target dataset.\n\n6. **Model Scaling**: Scaling up the pre-training configurations with larger video datasets or more powerful backbones has shown to improve performance. For applications requiring higher accuracy, consider using larger datasets for pre-training or employing more powerful model architectures.\n\n7. **Inference Protocol**: The model uses a specific inference protocol (5 clips \u00d7 3 crops for Kinetics-400). It is recommended to ensure that the inference protocol is suitable for the target application and to consider adjusting it if necessary to optimize performance.\n\n8. **Fine-Tuning**: Additional fine-tuning on the target dataset with labels can significantly improve transfer learning performance. It is recommended to fine-tune the model on the specific dataset it will be used for, especially if the dataset differs substantially from Kinetics.\n\nIn summary, when publishing the model to Huggingface, it is important to clearly communicate these recommendations and potential issues to users, so they can effectively apply and adapt the model to their specific use cases."}

We evaluate our VideoMAE on five common video datasets: Kinetics-400 [34], Something-Something V2 [26], UCF101 [61], HMDB51 [35], and AVA [27]. The Kinetics-400 contains around 240k training videos and 20k validation videos of 10s from 400 classes. The Something-Something V2 is another large-scale video dataset, having around 169k videos for training and 20k videos for validation. In contrast to Kinetics-400, this dataset contains 174 motion-centric action classes. These two large-scale video datasets focus\n2. on different visual cues for action recognition. UCF101 and HMDB51 are two relatively small video datasets, which contain around 9.5k/3.5k train/val videos and 3.5k/1.5k train/val videos, respectively. Compared with those large-scale video datasets, these two small datasets are more suitable for verifying the effectiveness of VideoMAE, as training large ViT models is more challenging on small datasets. Moreover, we also transfer the learned ViT models by VideoMAE to downstream action detection task. We\n3. work on AVA, a dataset for spatiotemporal localization of human actions with 211k training and 57k validation video segments. In experiments of downstream tasks, we fine-tune the pre-trained VideoMAE models on the training set and report the results on the validation set. The implementation details are described in Appendix \u00a7 7.\n4. All the datasets we used are commonly used datasets for academic purpose. The license of the Something-Something V2 5 and UCF101 6 datasets is custom. The license of the Kinetics-400 7 , HMDB51 8 and AVA 9 datasets is CC BY-NC 4.0 10 .\n5. Kinetics-400. Our VideoMAE is pre-trained for 800 epochs on Kinetics-400 by default. During the fine-tuning phase, we perform the dense sampling following Slowfast [23]. For evaluation, all models share the same inference protocol, i.e., 5 clips \u00d7 3 crops. The default settings of pre-training and fine-tuning are shown in Table 9 and Table 12. For supervised training from scratch, we follow the recipe in [22] and train the model for 200 epochs. Note that we adopt the repeated augmentation [32] during the\n6. VideoMAE. If the pre-trained ViT-B is additionally fine-tuned on Kinetics-400 with labels, the transfer learning performance can further increase about 5 mAP (from 26.7 to 31.8). More remarkably, when we scale up the pre-training configurations with larger video datasets (e.g. Kinetics-700) or more powerful backbones (e.g. ViT-Large and ViT-Huge), VideoMAE can finally obtain better performance. For example, our ViT-L VideoMAE pre-trained on Kinetics-700 achieves 39.3 mAP and ViT-H VideoMAE pre-trained on\n7. UCF101. We follow a similar recipe on Kinetics for pre-training. Our VideoMAE is pre-trained with a masking ratio of 75% for 3200 epochs. The batch size and base learning rate are set to 192 and 3e-4, respectively. Here, 16 frames with a temporal stride of 4 are sampled. For fine-tuning, the model is trained with repeated augmentation [32] and a batch size of 128 for 100 epochs. The base learning rate, layer decay and drop path are set to 5e-4, 0.7 and 0.2, respectively.

This architecture is designed to handle video data, which consists of sequences of images (frames) over time.\n\nWhile the term \"tokenization\" is commonly associated with the process of converting text into tokens for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, in the context of video processing, tokenization refers to the process of converting video frames into a sequence of tokens that can be processed by the model.\n\nHere's a general outline of the tokenization process for video data in the context of a model like MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics:\n\n1. **Frame Extraction**: The first step is to extract frames from the video at a certain frame rate. This involves selecting a subset of frames from the video, which can be done uniformly (e.g., every k-th frame) or based on certain criteria (e.g., frames with significant motion).\n\n2. **Preprocessing**: Each extracted frame is then preprocessed. This typically includes resizing the frames to a fixed spatial resolution, normalizing pixel values, and potentially applying data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, or color jittering to improve the robustness of the model.\n\n3. **Patch Embedding**: The preprocessed frames are then divided into patches. Each patch is a small, square region of the frame (e.g., 16x16 pixels). These patches are then flattened and linearly projected into an embedding space using a trainable linear layer. This converts each patch into a vector, which is referred to as a \"patch token.\"\n\n4. **Temporal Embedding**: Since videos have a temporal dimension, it's important to encode the temporal order of the frames.

This process typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Resizing**: Videos come in various resolutions, and the model expects inputs of a consistent size. Therefore, each video frame is resized to a fixed spatial resolution that the model can process. This is often done by scaling the frames while maintaining their aspect ratio, followed by cropping or padding to reach the required dimensions.\n\n2. **Frame Sampling**: Video models often work with a fixed number of frames per video.

To relieve the above issues in video masked modeling, we make the customized design in our VideoMAE, and the overall pipeline is shown in Figure 1. Our VideoMAE takes the downsampled frames as inputs and uses the cube embedding to obtain video tokens. Then, we propose a simple design of tube masking with high ratio to perform MAE pre-training with an asymmetric encoderdecoder architecture. Our backbone uses the vanilla ViT with joint space-time attention.\n2. Temporal downsampling. According to the above analysis on temporal redundancy over consecutive frames, we propose to use the strided temporal sampling strategy to perform more efficient video pre-training. Formally, one video clip consisting of t consecutive frames is first randomly sampled from the original video V . We then use temporal sampling to compress the clip to T frames, each of which contains H \u00d7 W \u00d7 3 pixels. In experiments, the stride \u03c4 is set to 4 and 2 on Kinetics and Something-Something,\n3. Second, temporal correlation is another factor in our VideoMAE design. We find even under the extremely high masking ratio, we can still improve the masking efficiency by proposing the temporal tube masking mechanism. Temporal tube masking enforces a mask to expand over the whole temporal axis, namely, different frames sharing the same masking map. Mathematically, the tube mask mechanism can be expressed as I[p x,y,\u2022 \u2208 \u2126] \u223c Bernoulli(\u03c1 mask ) and different time t shares the same value. With this mechanism,\n4. Tube masking with extremely high ratios. First, temporal redundancy is a factor affecting Video-MAE design. We find that VideoMAE is in favor of extremely high masking ratios (e.g. 90% to 95%) compared with the ImageMAE. Video information density is much lower than images, and we expect a high ratio to increase the reconstruction difficulty. This high masking ratio is helpful to mitigate the information leakage during masked modeling and make masked video reconstruction a meaningful self-supervised\n5. temporal neighbors of masked cubes are always masked. So for some cubes with no or small motion (e.g., finger cube in 4th row of Figure 2 (d)), we can not find the spatiotemporal corresponding content in all frames. In this way, it would encourage our VideoMAE to reason over high-level semantics to recover these totally missing cubes. This simple strategy can alleviate the information leakage for cubes with no or negligible motion, and turns out to be effective in practice for masked video pre-training.\n6. We evaluate our VideoMAE on five common video datasets: Kinetics-400 [34], Something-Something V2 [26], UCF101 [61], HMDB51 [35], and AVA [27]. The Kinetics-400 contains around 240k training videos and 20k validation videos of 10s from 400 classes. The Something-Something V2 is another large-scale video dataset, having around 169k videos for training and 20k videos for validation. In contrast to Kinetics-400, this dataset contains 174 motion-centric action classes. These two large-scale video datasets focus\n7. work on AVA, a dataset for spatiotemporal localization of human actions with 211k training and 57k validation video segments. In experiments of downstream tasks, we fine-tune the pre-trained VideoMAE models on the training set and report the results on the validation set. The implementation details are described in Appendix \u00a7 7.\n8. on different visual cues for action recognition. UCF101 and HMDB51 are two relatively small video datasets, which contain around 9.5k/3.5k train/val videos and 3.5k/1.5k train/val videos, respectively. Compared with those large-scale video datasets, these two small datasets are more suitable for verifying the effectiveness of VideoMAE, as training large ViT models is more challenging on small datasets.

We evaluate our VideoMAE on five common video datasets: Kinetics-400 [34], Something-Something V2 [26], UCF101 [61], HMDB51 [35], and AVA [27]. The Kinetics-400 contains around 240k training videos and 20k validation videos of 10s from 400 classes.

In experiments of downstream tasks, we fine-tune the pre-trained VideoMAE models on the training set and report the results on the validation set. The implementation details are described in Appendix \u00a7 7.\n4. We present the detailed comparison with the state-of-the-art on UCF101 and HMDB51 in Table 13. Figure 6 additionally shows that our VideoMAE is a data-efficient learner that allows us to effectively train video transformers only from limited video data (e.g., 9.5k clips in UCF101, and 3.5k clips in HMDB51) without any ImageNet pre-training.

This suggests that the model may be better suited for recognizing actions in similar contexts where the background scenes are prominent and the actions do not involve significant camera movement. However, the model may not perform as well on datasets with a different domain, such as Something-Something V2, which contains motion-centric action classes and may require more temporal modeling.\n\n2. **Data Quality vs. Quantity**: The model's performance indicates that data quality is more important than data quantity in self-supervised video pre-training (SSVP). This is evidenced by the model achieving better accuracy with only 42k pre-training videos compared to Kinetics pre-trained models with 240k videos. Therefore, the model's behavior is likely to be influenced by the quality of the data it is exposed to, and it may perform better with high-quality, relevant datasets even if they are smaller in size.\n\n3. **Domain Shift**: There is an indication that domain shift between pre-training and target datasets could be an important issue.

However, it is not clear how this high masking ratio might affect performance across different types of video content or population subgroups.\n\n5. **Transfer Learning Performance**: The model shows an increase in transfer learning performance when fine-tuned on Kinetics-400 with labels. This implies that the model can benefit from additional supervised fine-tuning on specific datasets, which could be a factor in how it behaves when applied to new domains or contexts.\n\n6. **Population Subgroups**: The references do not provide specific information on the model's performance across different population subgroups. Therefore, to understand disparities in performance across factors such as age, gender, or ethnicity, [More Information Needed] is required. Evaluation should be disaggregated across these factors to uncover any potential biases or limitations in the model's applicability to diverse populations.\n\nIn summary, the model's behavior is influenced by the domain and context of the training data, the quality of the data, potential domain shifts when applied to new datasets, and the high masking ratio used during pre-training. The impact on different population subgroups is not addressed in the provided references, and further evaluation would be necessary to assess this aspect."}

The evaluation results highlight the model's ability to capture spatiotemporal structure representations effectively, outperforming ImageMAE and ImageNet-21k supervised pre-trained models in most categories on the Something-Something V2 dataset.\n\nThe model demonstrates significant data efficiency, as it can be effectively trained on limited video data, such as 9.5k clips from UCF101 and 3.5k clips from HMDB51, without relying on ImageNet pre-training. It significantly surpasses training from scratch, MoCo v3 pre-training, and previous best performances on these datasets.\n\nHowever, the model does have limitations. For instance, it may struggle to capture motion information from very small objects, possibly due to the high masking ratio used during pre-training, which could lead to masking out tokens containing small motion patterns.\n\nWhen the pre-trained ViT-B is fine-tuned on Kinetics-400 with labels, there is an observed increase in transfer learning performance by about 5 mAP. Scaling up the pre-training configurations with larger video datasets or more powerful backbones further improves performance. For example, a ViT-L VideoMAE pre-trained on Kinetics-700 achieves 39.3 mAP.\n\nThe pre-training of VideoMAE involves a masking ratio of 75% for 3200 epochs, with a batch size of 192 and a base learning rate of 3e-4. During fine-tuning, the model is trained with repeated augmentation and a batch size of 128 for 100 epochs, with a base learning rate of 5e-4, layer decay of 0.7, and drop path of 0.2.\n\nIn summary, the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model shows promising results in terms of data efficiency and performance on various video datasets, with potential areas for improvement in capturing motion from small objects."}

Initially, the VideoMAE architecture was pre-trained for 800 epochs on the Kinetics-400 dataset, as mentioned in reference 4. This pre-training phase is crucial for the model to learn rich representations from the video data.\n\nFollowing the pre-training, the model was fine-tuned on the same Kinetics-400 dataset. The fine-tuning process involved dense sampling as per the Slowfast methodology, and the model was trained for 200 epochs, as indicated in reference 4. During this phase, repeated augmentation techniques were employed to enhance the model's generalization capabilities.\n\nFor evaluation purposes, the model adheres to a standardized inference protocol of 5 clips \u00d7 3 crops, ensuring consistency and reliability in performance assessment across different datasets.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific amount of time taken to train the model is not directly provided in the references. The duration of training would depend on various factors, including the computational resources used (such as the type and number of GPUs), the implementation details, and any optimizations that may have been applied during the training process.\n\nFor more detailed information on the training duration, one would need to refer to the actual training logs or additional documentation that provides insights into the computational efficiency and time metrics for the training process.\n```\n\nSince the exact amount of time used to train the model is not specified in the provided references, the answer to the question is \"[More Information Needed]\"."}

These patches are then linearly embedded into a higher-dimensional space.\n\n2. **Masking Mechanism**: A significant portion of the video tokens (e.g., 90% or more) are randomly masked out, meaning they are not provided to the encoder. This forces the model to learn to reconstruct the missing information based on the context provided by the remaining visible tokens.\n\n3. **Transformer Encoder**: The visible tokens are processed by a Transformer-based encoder. This encoder consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens when reconstructing the masked portions.\n\n4. **Transformer Decoder**: The decoder is also based on the Transformer architecture. It takes the encoder's output and the embeddings of the masked tokens as input and attempts to reconstruct the original video tokens. The decoder's architecture is typically symmetrical to the encoder, with self-attention and feed-forward layers.\n\n5. **Reconstruction Head**: At the output of the decoder, a reconstruction head is used to predict the original pixel values of the masked patches. This is typically a linear projection that maps the decoder's output back to the pixel space.\n\n6. **Fine-tuning**: After pre-training with the self-supervised masking task, the model is fine-tuned on a labeled dataset like Kinetics. During fine-tuning, the masking mechanism is removed, and the model is trained in a supervised manner to perform a specific task, such as action recognition. The output layer is adapted to the task, often replaced with a classification head that outputs probabilities over the action classes.\n\nThe VideoMAE architecture leverages the power of Transformers to handle the complex spatiotemporal patterns in video data and is fine-tuned to achieve high performance on video classification tasks. The MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model has been specifically fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset, which contains a large number of videos across various action categories, making it well-suited for action recognition tasks.", "The model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics is designed with the objective of understanding and interpreting video content. It is a machine learning model that has been fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset, which is a large-scale, high-quality dataset of YouTube video URLs that include a wide range of human activities. The primary goal of this model is to accurately classify and recognize various actions and activities within video clips.\n\nBy being fine-tuned on the Kinetics dataset, the model has learned to identify and categorize the different types of movements and actions that are present in the videos. This enables it to be used in applications such as video surveillance, human-computer interaction, content moderation, and any other domain that requires an understanding of video content at a granular level.\n\nThe model leverages the VideoMAE (Masked Autoencoder) architecture, which is particularly suited for video understanding tasks. The VideoMAE approach involves training the model to reconstruct video frames from partially masked inputs, which encourages the model to learn robust and meaningful representations of the video content. After pre-training with this self-supervised learning technique, the model is then fine-tuned on labeled video data (like the Kinetics dataset) to perform specific tasks such as action recognition with higher accuracy."]}

We perform an investigation of this design on the Kinetics-400 and\n11. VideoMAE uses the simple masked autoencoder and **plain ViT** backbone to perform video self-supervised learning. Due to the extremely high masking ratio, the pre-training time of VideoMAE is **much shorter** than contrastive learning methods (**3.2x** speedup). VideoMAE can serve as **a simple but strong baseline** for future research in self-supervised video pre-training.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the model architecture and objective about the model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics.

The architecture is based on a 16-frame vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) Base model. The encoder and decoder's specific architectural design is detailed in the referenced Table 8, which is not provided here, so [More Information Needed] for the exact specifications.\n\nThe objective of the model during pre-training is to reconstruct the pixels of masked tokens, following a simple masking and reconstruction strategy inspired by ImageMAE but tailored for self-supervised video pre-training (SSVP). The model employs a high masking ratio of 75% to leverage the temporally redundant video content, allowing for effective learning even with a significant portion of the input data being masked.\n\nFor fine-tuning on the Kinetics-400 dataset, the model is trained with repeated augmentation and a batch size of 128 for 100 epochs. The base learning rate is set to 5e-4, with a layer decay of 0.7 and a drop path rate of 0.2. The fine-tuning process does not involve the decoder, focusing on the encoder to learn effective video representations.\n\nIn summary, the MCG-NJU/videomae-base-finetuned-kinetics model is a video masked autoencoder with a plain ViT backbone, designed for self-supervised pre-training and fine-tuned for video understanding tasks on the Kinetics-400 dataset."}
