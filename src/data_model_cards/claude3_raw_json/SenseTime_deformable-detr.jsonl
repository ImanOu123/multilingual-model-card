By replacing Transformer attention modules with deformable attention modules in DETR, we establish an efficient and fast converging detection system, dubbed as Deformable DETR (see Fig. 1).\n2. The deformable attention module is designed for processing convolutional feature maps as key elements. Let N q be the number of query elements, when M K is relatively small, the complexity of the deformable attention module is of O(2N q C 2 + min(HW C 2 , N q KC 2 )) (See Appendix A.1 for details). When it is applied in DETR encoder, where N q = HW , the complexity becomes O(HW C 2 ), which is of linear complexity with the spatial size. When it is applied as the cross-attention modules Published as a\n3. Deformable Transformer Encoder. We replace the Transformer attention modules processing feature maps in DETR with the proposed multi-scale deformable attention module. Both the input and output of the encoder are of multi-scale feature maps with the same resolutions. In encoder, we extract multi-scale feature maps {x l } L\u22121 l=1 (L = 4) from the output feature maps of stages C 3 through C 5 in ResNet (He et al., 2016) (transformed by a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution), where C l is of resolution 2 l lower than the input\n4. Deformable Attention Module. The core issue of applying Transformer attention on image feature maps is that it would look over all possible spatial locations. To address this, we present a deformable attention module. Inspired by deformable convolution (Dai et al., 2017;Zhu et al., 2019b), the deformable attention module only attends to a small set of key sampling points around a reference point, regardless of the spatial size of the feature maps, as shown in Fig. 2. By assigning only a small fixed number\n5. attention, where a pre-filtering mechanism is introduced by the deformable sampling locations. When the sampling points traverse all possible locations, the proposed attention module is equivalent to Transformer attention.\n6. **TL; DR.** Deformable DETR is an efficient and fast-converging end-to-end object detector. It mitigates the high complexity and slow convergence issues of DETR via a novel sampling-based efficient attention mechanism.  \n\n![deformable_detr](./figs/illustration.png)\n\n![deformable_detr](./figs/convergence.png)\n7. **Abstract.** DETR has been recently proposed to eliminate the need for many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good performance. However, it suffers from slow convergence and limited feature spatial resolution, due to the limitation of Transformer attention modules in processing image feature maps. To mitigate these issues, we proposed Deformable DETR, whose attention modules only attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference. Deformable DETR can achieve\n8. capability of Transformers. We propose the deformable attention module, which attends to a small set of sampling locations as a pre-filter for prominent key elements out of all the feature map pixels. The module can be naturally extended to aggregating multi-scale features, without the help of FPN (Lin et al., 2017a). In Deformable DETR , we utilize (multi-scale) deformable attention modules to replace the Transformer attention modules processing feature maps, as shown in Fig. 1.\n9. Deformable DETR is an end-to-end object detector, which is efficient and fast-converging. It enables us to explore more interesting and practical variants of end-to-end object detectors. At the core of Deformable DETR are the (multi-scale) deformable attention modules, which is an efficient attention mechanism in processing image feature maps. We hope our work opens up new possibilities in exploring end-to-end object detection.\n10. **TL; DR.** Deformable DETR is an efficient and fast-converging end-to-end object detector.

The visualization indicates that Deformable DETR looks at extreme points of the object to determine its bounding box, which is similar to the observation in DETR (Carion et al., 2020). More concretely, Deformable DETR attends to left/right boundary of the object for x coordinate and width, and top/bottom boundary for y coordinate and height. Meanwhile, different to DETR (Carion et al., 2020), our Deformable DETR also looks at pixels inside the object for predicting its category.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nSummarize the type of the model SenseTime/deformable-detr in terms of the training method, machine learning type, and modality in one sentence.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model SenseTime/deformable-detr.

Deformable DETR opens up possibilities for us to exploit variants of end-to-end object detectors, thanks to its fast convergence, and computational and memory efficiency. We explore a simple and effective iterative bounding box refinement mechanism to improve the detection performance. We also try a two-stage Deformable DETR, where the region proposals are also generated by a vaiant of Deformable DETR, which are further fed into the decoder for iterative bounding box refinement.\n8. Modern object detectors employ many hand-crafted components , e.g., anchor generation, rule-based training target assignment, non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing. They are not fully end-to-end. Recently, Carion et al. (2020) proposed DETR to eliminate the need for such hand-crafted components, and built the first fully end-to-end object detector, achieving very competitive performance. DETR utilizes a simple architecture, by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer (Vaswani\n9.

The tokenization steps are as follows:\n\n1. The input text is first split into individual words or tokens using whitespace as the delimiter.\n\n2. Each token is then converted into its corresponding integer ID based on a predefined vocabulary. The vocabulary is typically constructed during the model training phase and contains the most frequently occurring words in the training data.\n\n3. To handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words that are not present in the predefined vocabulary, the model uses a special \"unknown\" token (usually represented as `[UNK]`). Any word that is not found in the vocabulary is replaced with this unknown token.\n\n4. The tokenized sequence is then padded or truncated to a fixed length. If the sequence is shorter than the desired length, special padding tokens (e.g., `[PAD]`) are appended to the end of the sequence until it reaches the required length.

You can get the config file and pretrained model of Deformable DETR (the link is in \"Main Results\" session), then run following command to evaluate it on COCO 2017 validation set:\n\n```bash\n<path to config file> --resume <path to pre-trained model> --eval\n```\n\nYou can also run distributed evaluation by using ```./tools/run_dist_launch.sh``` or ```./tools/run_dist_slurm.sh```.\n8. 5. \"DETR-DC5+\" indicates DETR-DC5 with some modifications, including using Focal Loss for bounding box classification and increasing number of object queries to 300.\n6. \"Batch Infer Speed\" refer to inference with batch size = 4  to maximize GPU utilization.\n7. The original implementation is based on our internal codebase. There are slight differences in the final accuracy and running time due to the plenty details in platform switch.\n9. than DETR (especially on small objects) with 10\u00d7 less training epochs. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
