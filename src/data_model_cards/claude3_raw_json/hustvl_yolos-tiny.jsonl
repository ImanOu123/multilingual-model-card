Model Variants. With available computational resources, we study several YOLOS variants. Detailed configurations are summarized in Tab. 1. The input patch size for all models is 16 \u00d7 16. YOLOS-Ti (Tiny), -S (Small), and -B (Base) directly correspond to DeiT-Ti, -S, and -B [58]. From the model scaling perspective [20,56,61], the small and base models of YOLOS / DeiT can be seen as performing width scaling (w) [30,68] on the corresponding tiny model.  [20]. Note that all the numbers listed are for\n2. Pre-training. We pre-train all YOLOS / ViT models on ImageNet-1k [51] dataset using the dataefficient training strategy suggested by Touvron et al. [58]. The parameters are initialized with a truncated normal distribution and optimized using AdamW [40]. The learning rate and batch size are 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 1024, respectively. The learning rate decay is cosine and the weight decay is 0.05. Rand-Augment [14] and random erasing [70] implemented by timm library [65] are used for data augmentation. Stochastic depth\n3. We study the pre-training and the transfer learning performance of different model scaling strategies, i.e., width scaling (w), uniform compound scaling (dwr) and fast scaling (dwr). The models are scaled from \u223c 1.2G to \u223c 4.5G FLOPs regime for pre-training. Detailed model configurations and descriptions are given in Sec. 3.1 and Tab. 1.\n4. Note that the available scaling strategies are designed for architectures with complexity f \u221d dw 2 r 2 , so theoretically the dwr as well as dwr model scaling are not directly applicable to ViT. However, during pre-training phase the resolution is relatively low, therefore f (Lin.) dominates the FLOPs ( f (Lin.) f (Att.) > 5). Our experiments indicate that some model scaling properties of ViT are consistent with CNNs when f (Lin.) f (Att.) is large.\n5. Fine-tuning. We fine-tune all YOLOS models on COCO object detection benchmark [36] in a similar way as Carion et al. [10].

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how you can use the model independently:\n\n1. Load the pre-trained model: Start by loading the hustvl/yolos-tiny model using a deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. You can download the model weights and architecture files from the model repository or a reliable source.\n\n2. Preprocess the input: Prepare your input data, such as an image or a batch of images, by resizing them to the appropriate dimensions required by the model. Typically, you'll need to normalize the pixel values and convert the data into a suitable tensor format.\n\n3. Forward pass: Pass the preprocessed input through the model's architecture. This involves feeding the input tensor to the model's layers sequentially, allowing the model to perform its computations and generate output features or predictions.\n\n4. Post-process the output: Interpret the model's output based on the specific task it was trained for. In the case of hustvl/yolos-tiny, which is an object detection model, the output will likely contain bounding box coordinates and class probabilities for detected objects. You may need to apply non-maximum suppression (NMS) to filter out overlapping detections and select the most confident predictions.\n\n5. Visualize or utilize the results: Finally, you can visualize the detected objects by drawing bounding boxes on the input image or use the detected object information for further analysis or downstream tasks.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use the hustvl/yolos-tiny model without relying on a pre-built pipeline. This approach provides more flexibility and control over the model's usage, allowing you to integrate it into your own custom workflows or applications.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that using a model directly requires a deeper understanding of the model's architecture, input/output formats, and any specific preprocessing or post-processing steps required. In contrast, using a pipeline abstracts away many of these details and provides a more user-friendly interface for common tasks.", "Certainly! Here's a short passage answering the question about the model hustvl/yolos-tiny, along with a code snippet demonstrating its usage:\n\nThe hustvl/yolos-tiny model is a lightweight object detection model based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture. It is designed to be fast and efficient, making it suitable for real-time object detection tasks on resource-constrained devices. The model is pre-trained on the COCO dataset and can detect 80 different object categories.\n\nTo use the hustvl/yolos-tiny model, you can leverage the Transformers library by Hugging Face. Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to load the model and perform object detection on an image:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import YolosFeatureExtractor, YolosForObjectDetection\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\n\n# Load the pre-trained model and feature extractor\nmodel = YolosForObjectDetection.from_pretrained('hustvl/yolos-tiny')\nfeature_extractor = YolosFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained('hustvl/yolos-tiny')\n\n# Load and preprocess the image\nurl = 'https://example.com/image.jpg'\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\ninputs = feature_extractor(images=image, return_tensors='pt')\n\n# Perform object detection\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# Process the predictions\npredictions = outputs.logits.softmax(-1)\n# ... further processing and visualization of the predictions\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, we first import the necessary classes from the Transformers library. We load the pre-trained hustvl/yolos-tiny model and its corresponding feature extractor.\n\nNext, we load an image from a URL using the `requests` library and preprocess it using the feature extractor. The preprocessed image is then passed to the model for object detection.\n\nThe model returns the predicted object locations and class probabilities in the `outputs` variable. We apply softmax to the logits to obtain the class probabilities.\n\nFinally, you can further process the predictions, such as filtering based on confidence thresholds, visualizing the detected objects on the image, or extracting the bounding box coordinates for each detected object.\n\nBy using the hustvl/yolos-tiny model, you can quickly and efficiently perform object detection on images, even on devices with limited computational resources."]}

Overestimating the model's accuracy: Users might assume that the model is highly accurate across all object classes and scenarios, when in reality, its compact size may lead to lower precision and recall compared to larger, more complex models.\n\n2. Assuming the model is suitable for all object detection tasks: YOLO-tiny is designed for real-time, resource-constrained applications. Users might misunderstand its limitations and attempt to use it for tasks requiring higher accuracy or dealing with small, densely packed objects.\n\n3. Misinterpreting the model's confidence scores: Users might place too much trust in the model's predicted confidence scores without considering factors like class imbalance, dataset biases, or domain shifts that could affect the model's calibration.\n\n4. Overlooking potential biases: If the training data contains biases (e.g., underrepresentation of certain object classes, demographics, or environments), the model may inherit these biases, leading to skewed predictions or performance disparities.\n\n5. Misunderstanding the impact of input preprocessing: Users might not fully grasp how image resizing, normalization, or other preprocessing steps affect the model's predictions and fail to apply these steps consistently during inference.\n\nTo mitigate these misunderstandings, it is essential to provide clear documentation about the model's architecture, performance metrics, intended use cases, and limitations.

Reduced accuracy: As a tiny model, it sacrifices some accuracy for the sake of faster inference speed and lower computational requirements compared to larger models like YOLOv5.\n\n2. Limited object categories: The model is trained on a specific dataset with a fixed number of object categories. It may not perform well in detecting objects outside of its training categories.\n\n3. Difficulty with small objects: Due to its reduced size and capacity, the model may struggle to detect very small objects or objects that appear at a small scale in the image.\n\n4. Sensitivity to image quality: The model's performance can be affected by factors such as low resolution, blur, occlusion, or adverse lighting conditions in the input images.\n\n5. Lack of contextual understanding: The model focuses on detecting individual objects and does not have a deep understanding of the overall context or relationships between objects in the scene.\n\n6. Potential biases: Like any machine learning model, it may inherit biases present in the training data, leading to potential fairness concerns or uneven performance across different object categories or demographics.\n\n7. Inability to handle complex tasks: The model is designed for object detection and cannot directly perform more complex tasks like object tracking, instance segmentation, or reasoning about object interactions without additional components or modifications.\n\nIt's important to consider these limitations when applying the hustvl/yolos-tiny model to specific use cases and to evaluate its performance in the target domain to ensure it meets the required accuracy and robustness standards.", "The hustvl/yolos-tiny model is a lightweight object detection model designed for real-time applications.

When it comes to preprocessing the input data for this model, the following steps are typically involved:\n\n1. Image Resizing: The input images are resized to a fixed size of 416x416 pixels. This is done to ensure that all images have a consistent size before being fed into the model. The resizing process maintains the aspect ratio of the original image by padding the shorter side with zeros until it reaches the target size.\n\n2. Normalization: After resizing, the pixel values of the input images are normalized. The pixel values, which typically range from 0 to 255, are scaled to a range of 0 to 1. This normalization step helps to improve the convergence and stability of the model during training.\n\n3. Channel Ordering: The model expects the input images to have a specific channel ordering. In the case of the hustvl/yolos-tiny model, the expected channel order is BGR (Blue, Green, Red). If the input images are in a different channel order, such as RGB, they need to be reordered to match the model's expectation.\n\n4. Batch Processing: The preprocessed images are typically grouped into batches before being passed to the model for inference. This allows for efficient processing of multiple images simultaneously.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps may vary slightly depending on the implementation and framework being used. However, the general steps of resizing, normalization, and channel ordering are commonly applied to ensure compatibility with the hustvl/yolos-tiny model."]}

Different pre-training strategies (supervised, self-supervised) can significantly impact results.\n- Compared to highly-optimized tiny CNN object detectors, YOLOS achieves competitive performance in terms of AP, FLOPs and FPS. It could serve as a promising starting point for Transformer-based model scaling in object detection.\n\nHandling of Variable Input Sizes:\n- Unlike image classification, object detection benchmarks usually have variable image resolutions and aspect ratios. YOLOS has to adapt the position embeddings (PE) in the underlying ViT to handle this.\n- The references study two types of PE settings, but [More Information Needed] on the details and impact of those settings.\n- About 1/3 of the model weights are used for providing positional information via the PEs. While this is expensive in terms of model size, the authors argue it allows the PEs to learn positional relations from scratch without injecting additional inductive biases.\n\nPopulation Subgroups and Disaggregated Evaluation:\n- [More Information Needed] The provided references do not contain information on YOLOS' performance across different population subgroups or factors that could reveal disparities. Disaggregated evaluation across relevant factors would be needed to uncover and understand any such issues."}

As for the model design, YOLOS closely follows the original ViT architecture [21], and is optimized for object detection in the same vein as Carion et al. [10]. YOLOS can be easily adapted to various canonical Transformer architectures available in NLP as well as in computer vision. This intentionally simple setup is not designed for better detection performance, but to exactly reveal characteristics of the Transformer family in object detection as unbiased as possible.\n7. Comparisons with Tiny-sized CNN Detectors. As shown in Tab. 5, the tiny-sized YOLOS model achieves impressive performance compared with well-established and highly-optimized CNN object detectors. YOLOS-Ti is strong in AP and competitive in FLOPs & FPS even though Transformer is not intentionally designed to optimize these factors. From the model scaling perspective [20,56,61], YOLOS-Ti can serve as a promising model scaling start point.\n8. Interpreting the Results. Although the performance is seemingly discouraging, the numbers are meaningful, as YOLOS is not purposefully designed for better performance, but designed to precisely reveal the transferability of ViT in object detection. E.g., YOLOS-B is directly adopted from the BERT-Base architecture [18] in NLP. This 12 layers, 768 channels Transformer along with its variants have shown impressive performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. We demonstrate that with minimal modifications, this\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nThis is an experimental section some developers are beginning to add, where work on explainability/interpretability may go about the model hustvl/yolos-tiny.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model hustvl/yolos-tiny.

From the model scaling perspective [20,56,61], the small and base models of YOLOS / DeiT can be seen as performing width scaling (w) [30,68] on the corresponding tiny model.  [20].

All the parameters are initialized from ImageNet-1k pre-trained weights except for the MLP heads for classification & bounding box regression as well as one hundred [DET] tokens, which are randomly initialized. We train YOLOS on a single node with 8 \u00d7 12G GPUs. The learning rate and batch sizes are 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 8 respectively.

From the model scaling perspective [20,56,61], the small and base models of YOLOS / DeiT can be seen as performing width scaling (w) [30,68] on the corresponding tiny model.  [20]. Note that all the numbers listed are for\n2. Fine-tuning. We fine-tune all YOLOS models on COCO object detection benchmark [36] in a similar way as Carion et al. [10]. All the parameters are initialized from ImageNet-1k pre-trained weights except for the MLP heads for classification & bounding box regression as well as one hundred [DET] tokens, which are randomly initialized. We train YOLOS on a single node with 8 \u00d7 12G GPUs. The learning rate and batch sizes are 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and 8 respectively. The learning rate decay is cosine and the weight decay\n3. Pre-training. We pre-train all YOLOS / ViT models on ImageNet-1k [51] dataset using the dataefficient training strategy suggested by Touvron et al. [58]. The parameters are initialized with a truncated normal distribution and optimized using AdamW [40]. The learning rate and batch size are 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 1024, respectively. The learning rate decay is cosine and the weight decay is 0.05. Rand-Augment [14] and random erasing [70] implemented by timm library [65] are used for data augmentation. Stochastic depth\n4. Note that the available scaling strategies are designed for architectures with complexity f \u221d dw 2 r 2 , so theoretically the dwr as well as dwr model scaling are not directly applicable to ViT. However, during pre-training phase the resolution is relatively low, therefore f (Lin.) dominates the FLOPs ( f (Lin.) f (Att.) > 5). Our experiments indicate that some model scaling properties of ViT are consistent with CNNs when f (Lin.) f (Att.) is large.\n5. The first one is uniform compound scaling (dwr) [20,56]. In this case, the scaling is uniform w.r.t. FLOPs along all model dimensions (i.e., width (w), depth (d) and resolution (r)). The second one is fast scaling (dwr) [20] that encourages primarily scaling model width (w), while scaling depth (d) and resolution (r) to a lesser extent w.r.t. FLOPs. During the ImageNet-1k pre-training phase, we apply dwr and dwr scaling to DeiT-Ti (\u223c 1.2G FLOPs) and scale the model to \u223c 4.5G FLOPs to align with the\n6. In object detection and many other computer vision benchmarks, the image resolutions as well as the aspect ratios are usually not fixed as the image classification task. Due to the changes in input resolutions & aspect ratios (sequence length) from the image classification task to the object detection task, the position embedding (PE) in ViT / YOLOS has also to be changed and adapted 4 . The changes in PE could affect the model size and performance. In this work, we study two types of PE settings for YOLOS:\n7. <details>\n<summary>To train the <code>YOLOS-S (dWr)</code> model in the paper, run this command:</summary>\n<pre><code>\npython -m torch.distributed.launch \\\n    --nproc_per_node=8 \\\n    --use_env main.py \\\n    --coco_path /path/to/coco\n    --batch_size 1 \\\n    --lr 2.5e-5 \\\n    --epochs 150 \\\n    --backbone_name small_dWr \\\n    --pre_trained /path/to/deit-small-dWr-scale.pth\\\n    --eval_size 800 \\\n    --init_pe_size 512 864 \\\n    --mid_pe_size 512 864 \\\n    --output_dir /output/path/box_model\n</code></pre>\n8. <details>\n<summary>To train the <code>YOLOS-B</code> model in the paper, run this command:</summary>\n<pre><code>\npython -m torch.distributed.launch \\\n    --nproc_per_node=8 \\\n    --use_env main.py \\\n    --coco_path /path/to/coco\n    --batch_size 1 \\\n    --lr 2.5e-5 \\\n    --epochs 150 \\\n    --backbone_name base \\\n    --pre_trained /path/to/deit-base.pth\\\n    --eval_size 800 \\\n    --init_pe_size 800 1344 \\\n    --mid_pe_size 800 1344 \\\n    --output_dir /output/path/box_model\n</code></pre>\n</details>\n9. <details>\n<summary>To train the <code>YOLOS-S</code> model with 300 epoch pretrained Deit-S in the paper, run this command:</summary>\n<pre><code>\npython -m torch.distributed.launch \\\n    --nproc_per_node=8 \\\n    --use_env main.py \\\n    --coco_path /path/to/coco\n    --batch_size 1 \\\n    --lr 2.5e-5 \\\n    --epochs 150 \\\n    --backbone_name small \\\n    --pre_trained /path/to/deit-small-300epoch.pth\\\n    --eval_size 800 \\\n    --init_pe_size 512 864 \\\n    --mid_pe_size 512 864 \\\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the compute infrastructure about the model hustvl/yolos-tiny.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model hustvl/yolos-tiny.
