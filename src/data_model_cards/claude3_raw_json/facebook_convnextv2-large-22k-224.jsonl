This model has been trained on a large dataset of 22,000 classes, allowing it to recognize a wide range of objects and scenes out of the box.\n\nTo use the model without fine-tuning, you can simply pass an input image through the model, and it will output a set of predicted class probabilities. The class with the highest probability is the model's prediction for the given image. This process is known as inference.\n\nHere's a general workflow for using the model without fine-tuning:\n\n1. Load the pre-trained model into your code environment (e.g., using the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python).\n2. Preprocess your input image to match the model's expected input format (e.g., resizing to 224x224 pixels and normalizing pixel values).\n3. Pass the preprocessed image through the model to obtain the predicted class probabilities.\n4. Interpret the model's output by selecting the class with the highest probability or applying a threshold to filter out low-confidence predictions.\n\nBy leveraging the model's pre-existing knowledge, you can quickly and easily integrate it into your application for tasks such as image classification, content moderation, or image search, without the need for expensive and time-consuming fine-tuning on a specific dataset.", "The facebook/convnextv2-large-22k-224 model is a pre-trained image classification model that can be used for various computer vision tasks without the need for post-processing. This model is based on the ConvNeXt architecture, which is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network designed to achieve high performance while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nOne of the key advantages of using this model is its ability to generate accurate predictions directly from the input images, without requiring any additional post-processing steps. The model takes an input image of size 224x224 pixels and outputs a probability distribution over the 22,000 classes it was trained on. The class with the highest probability can be considered as the predicted label for the input image.\n\nTo use the model, you simply need to preprocess the input image by resizing it to 224x224 pixels and normalizing the pixel values. Once the image is preprocessed, you can pass it through the model to obtain the predicted class probabilities. The model's output can be directly used for tasks such as image classification, object recognition, or as a feature extractor for downstream tasks like image retrieval or clustering.\n\nBy eliminating the need for post-processing, the facebook/convnextv2-large-22k-224 model streamlines the inference process and reduces the computational overhead. This makes it an attractive choice for applications that require real-time or low-latency predictions, such as mobile or embedded devices. Additionally, the model's high accuracy and robustness to various image transformations make it suitable for a wide range of computer vision applications.", "The facebook/convnextv2-large-22k-224 model can be used without plugging into a pipeline by directly utilizing the model's forward pass. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Load the pre-trained model using the `AutoModel` class from the `transformers` library:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModel\n\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"facebook/convnextv2-large-22k-224\")\n```\n\n2. Preprocess your input image(s) to match the expected input format of the model. This typically involves resizing the image to the appropriate dimensions (e.g., 224x224) and normalizing the pixel values.\n\n3. Convert the preprocessed image(s) to a tensor or a batch of tensors, depending on whether you have a single image or multiple images.\n\n4. Pass the input tensor(s) through the model's forward pass to obtain the model's output:\n\n```python\noutput = model(input_tensor)\n```\n\nThe `output` will be a tensor or a tuple of tensors representing the model's predictions or features.\n\n5. Interpret the model's output based on your specific task or application. For example, if you're using the model for image classification, you can apply a softmax function to the output to obtain class probabilities.\n\nBy following these steps, you can utilize the facebook/convnextv2-large-22k-224 model directly without the need for a pipeline. This approach provides more flexibility and control over the model's usage, allowing you to integrate it into your own custom workflows or applications.\n\nKeep in mind that you may need to handle additional preprocessing steps, such as data augmentation or normalization, depending on your specific use case and the requirements of the model.", "The facebook/convnextv2-large-22k-224 model is a pre-trained ConvNeXt model developed by Facebook AI. It is a large-sized model trained on the ImageNet-22k dataset with an input resolution of 224x224 pixels. This model can be used for various computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.\n\nTo use the facebook/convnextv2-large-22k-224 model, you can leverage the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python.

We import the necessary classes from the Transformers library: `ConvNextFeatureExtractor` for preprocessing the input image and `ConvNextForImageClassification` for the pre-trained ConvNeXt model.\n\n2. We load the pre-trained ConvNeXt model and feature extractor using the `from_pretrained()` method, specifying the model name \"facebook/convnextv2-large-22k-224\".\n\n3. We load the input image using PIL's `Image.open()` method and preprocess it using the loaded feature extractor. The `return_tensors=\"pt\"` argument ensures that the preprocessed image is returned as a PyTorch tensor.\n\n4. We perform image classification by passing the preprocessed image to the model using the `model(**inputs)` syntax. The model returns the predicted logits.\n\n5. We obtain the predicted class index by finding the index of the maximum logit value using `argmax(-1).item()`.\n\n6. Finally, we map the predicted class index to its corresponding label using the `model.config.id2label` dictionary and print the predicted class label.\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates how to load and use the facebook/convnextv2-large-22k-224 model for image classification tasks.

We find that our FCMAE pre-training provides better initialization than the random baseline (i.e., 82.7 \u2192 83.7), but it still needs to catch up to the best performance obtained in the original supervised setup. This is in contrast to the recent success of masked image modeling using transformer-based models [3,31,77], where the pre-trained models significantly outperform the supervised counterparts. This motivates\n2. Our approach is conceptually simple and runs in a fully convolutional manner.

Our framework is illustrated in Figure 2, and we will now describe its main components in more detail.\n3. Encoder design. We use ConvNeXt [52] model as the encoder in our approach. One challenge in making masked image modeling effective is preventing the model from learning shortcuts that allow it to copy and paste information from the masked regions. This is relatively easy to prevent in transformer-based models, which can leave the visible patches as the only input to the encoder. However, it is more difficult to achieve this with ConvNets, as the 2D image structure must be preserved. While naive solutions\n4. encoder with the submanifold sparse convolution, which enables the model to operate only on the visible data points [15,27,28]. We note that the sparse convolution layers can be converted back to standard convolution at the fine-tuning stage without requiring additional handling. As an alternative, it is also possible to apply a binary masking operation before and after the dense convolution operation. This operation has numerically the same effect as sparse convolutions, is theoretically more\n5. To tackle this issue, our new insight is to view the masked image from a \"sparse data perspective\", which was inspired by learning on sparse point clouds in 3D tasks [15,76]. Our key observation is that the masked image can be represented as a 2D sparse array of pixels. Based on this insight, it is natural to incorporate sparse convolution into our framework to facilitate pre-training of the masked autoencoder. In practice, during pre-training, we propose to convert the standard convolution layer in the\n6. ImageNet-22K intermediate fine-tuning with the FCMAEpretrained ConvNeXt models.

Additionally, if the relationship between the architecture and the training objective is not taken into consideration, it may be unclear whether optimal performance can be achieved. In fact, previous research has shown that training ConvNets with mask-based self-supervised learning can be difficult [43], and empirical evidence suggests that transformers and ConvNets may have different feature learning behaviors that can affect representation quality.\n10. To perform this analysis, we randomly select 1,000 images from different classes in the ImageNet-1K validation set and extract the high-dimensional features from each layer of different models, including the FCMAE models, the ConvNeXt supervised model [52] and the MAE pretrained ViT model [31].

This suggests it is primarily designed for image classification tasks in the domain of natural images similar to those found in ImageNet.\n\nPopulation Subgroups:\n[More Information Needed] - The references do not provide specific information about performance on different population subgroups or potential disparities.\n\nOther Factors:\n- The model uses a convolution-based architecture (ConvNeXt V2) co-designed with the FCMAE pre-training framework (Ref 3, 5, 7, 9). This unique architecture and training approach may influence its performance characteristics compared to other models.\n- The model exhibits strong scaling behavior, with improved performance as model size increases (Ref 2, 7). The \"large\" variant is likely to have different performance than smaller or larger versions.\n- The model's feature representations evolve distinctly across layers compared to supervised ConvNeXt and MAE pretrained ViT models (Ref 10). This may affect its suitability for different downstream tasks or fine-tuning approaches.\n\nTo fully understand potential performance disparities across population subgroups, further disaggregated evaluation would be needed.

Our method, using a convolution-based architecture, sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy using publicly available data only (i.e. ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-22K).\n3. In this section, we present and analyze two key proposals, the FCMAE pre-training framework and ConvNeXt V2 architecture, which are co-designed to make masked-based self-supervised pre-training successful. We show these designs synergize well and provide a strong foundation for scaling the model to various sizes. Additionally, we compare our approach to previous masked image modeling approaches through experiments. Furthermore, we show that our largest ConvNeXt V2 Huge model, which has been pretrained using\n4. The results, shown in Figure 1, demonstrate strong model scaling behavior, with consistently improved performance over the supervised baseline across all model sizes. This is the first time the benefit of masked image modeling has been demonstrated in such a broad model spectrum, both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The complete tabulated results can be found in the appendix.\n5. We found that using the FCMAE framework without modifying the model architecture has a limited impact on representation learning quality. Similarly, the new GRN layer has a rather small effect on performance under the supervised setup. However, the combination of the two results in a significant improvement in fine-tuning perfor- mance. This supports the idea that both the model and learning framework should be considered together, particularly when it comes to self-supervised learning.\n6.

We propose two possible implementations to enable FCMAE pre-training: 1) sparse encoding using sparse convolution [15,27,28] supported by external libraries [15,18], and 2) simulating sparse encoding with the masked dense convolution, which can be easily implemented by applying binary masks before and after the standard convolution operation. As they produce numerically identical outputs, both can be adopted depending on different use cases. In this work, we adopt sparse\n4. As the learning capacity varies by model size, we adopt different fine-tuning recipes for each model. We summarize them in Table 9, 10 and 11. We see longer fine-tuning epochs help small models. We adopt two different learning-rate layer decay strategies in this work: group-wise [52], where we treat three sequential layers as a single \"layer\" and use the same decaying value for them, and the layer-wise [3], where we assign a distinct value for each layer, both following the standard decaying rule.

We empirically found that LayerScale [65] becomes unnecessary when GRN is applied and can be removed. Using this new block design, we create various models with varying efficiency and capacity, which we refer to as the ConvNeXt V2 model family.
