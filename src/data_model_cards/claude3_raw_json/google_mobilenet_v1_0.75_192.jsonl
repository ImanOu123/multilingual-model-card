For instance, this approach is used in the popular Caffe package [15]. 1 \u00d7 1 convolutions do not require this reordering in memory and can be implemented directly with GEMM which is one of the most optimized numerical linear algebra algorithms.

We present a class of efficient models called MobileNets for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyperparameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive\n7. experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including object detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.\n8. Convolutional neural networks have become ubiquitous in computer vision ever since AlexNet [19] popularized deep convolutional neural networks by winning the Ima-geNet Challenge: ILSVRC 2012 [24]. The general trend has been to make deeper and more complicated networks in order to achieve higher accuracy [27,31,29,8]. However, these advances to improve accuracy are not necessarily making networks more efficient with respect to size and speed. In many real world applications such as robotics, self-driving car\n9. Table 6 shows the accuracy, computation and size trade offs of shrinking the MobileNet architecture with the width multiplier \u03b1. Accuracy drops off smoothly until the architecture is made too small at \u03b1 = 0.25.\nTable 7 shows the accuracy, computation and size trade offs for different resolution multipliers by training Mo-bileNets with reduced input resolutions. Accuracy drops off smoothly across resolution.\n10. Although the base MobileNet architecture is already small and low latency, many times a specific use case or application may require the model to be smaller and faster. In order to construct these smaller and less computationally expensive models we introduce a very simple parameter \u03b1 called width multiplier. The role of the width multiplier \u03b1 is to thin a network uniformly at each layer. For a given layer  and width multiplier \u03b1, the number of input channels M becomes \u03b1M and the number of output channels N\n11.

We present a class of efficient models called MobileNets for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyperparameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive\n9. The MobileNet model is based on depthwise separable convolutions which is a form of factorized convolutions which factorize a standard convolution into a depthwise convolution and a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution called a pointwise convolution. For MobileNets the depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel. The pointwise convolution then applies a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution to combine the outputs the depthwise convolution. A standard convolution both filters and combines inputs into a new set of outputs\n10. where the computational cost depends multiplicatively on the number of input channels M , the number of output channels N the kernel size D k \u00d7 D k and the feature map size D F \u00d7 D F . MobileNet models address each of these terms and their interactions. First it uses depthwise separable convolutions to break the interaction between the number of output channels and the size of the kernel. The standard convolution operation has the effect of filtering features based on the convolutional kernels and\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nIf the model google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192 is fine-tuned from another model, provide the name and link to that base model.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192.

We train MobileNet for fine grained recognition on the Stanford Dogs dataset [17]. We extend the approach of [18] and collect an even larger but noisy training set than [18] from the web. We use the noisy web data to pretrain a fine grained dog recognition model and then fine tune the model on the Stanford Dogs training set. Results on Stanford Dogs test set are in Table 10. MobileNet can almost achieve the state of the art results from [18] at greatly reduced computation and size.\n2. Another use-case for MobileNet is compressing large systems with unknown or esoteric training procedures. In a face attribute classification task, we demonstrate a synergistic relationship between MobileNet and distillation [9], a knowledge transfer technique for deep networks. We seek to reduce a large face attribute classifier with 75 million parameters and 1600 million Mult-Adds. The classifier is trained on a multi-attribute dataset similar to YFCC100M [32].\n3. We re-train PlaNet using the MobileNet architecture on the same data. While the full PlaNet model based on the Inception V3 architecture [31] has 52 million parameters and 5.74 billion mult-adds. The MobileNet model has only 13 million parameters with the usual 3 million for the body and 10 million for the final layer and 0.58 Million mult-adds. As shown in Tab. 11, the MobileNet version delivers only slightly decreased performance compared to PlaNet despite being much more compact. Moreover, it still\n4. We distill a face attribute classifier using the MobileNet architecture. Distillation [9] works by training the classifier to emulate the outputs of a larger model 2 instead of the ground-truth labels, hence enabling training from large (and potentially infinite) unlabeled datasets. Marrying the scalability of distillation training and the parsimonious parameterization of MobileNet, the end system not only requires no regularization (e.g. weight-decay and early-stopping), but also demonstrates enhanced\n5. performances. It is evident from Tab. 12 that the MobileNet-based classifier is resilient to aggressive model shrinking: it achieves a similar mean average precision across attributes (mean AP) as the in-house while consuming only 1% the Multi-Adds.\n6. ```\n$ bazel build -c opt --config=cuda mobilenet_v1_{eval,train}\n```\n7. MobileNet models were trained in TensorFlow [1] using RMSprop [33] with asynchronous gradient descent similar to Inception V3 [31]. However, contrary to training large models we use less regularization and data augmentation techniques because small models have less trouble with overfitting. When training MobileNets we do not use side heads or label smoothing and additionally reduce the amount image of distortions by limiting the size of small crops that are used in large Inception training [31].\n8. [MobileNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) are small, low-latency, low-power models parameterized to meet the resource constraints of a variety of use cases. They can be built upon for classification, detection, embeddings and segmentation similar to how other popular large scale models, such as Inception, are used. MobileNets can be run efficiently on mobile devices with [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite).\n9. There has been rising interest in building small and efficient neural networks in the recent literature, e.g. [16,34,12,36,22]. Many different approaches can be generally categorized into either compressing pretrained networks or training small networks directly.

Although the base MobileNet architecture is already small and low latency, many times a specific use case or application may require the model to be smaller and faster.

Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references about the MobileNet architecture and the specific google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192 model, here are some recommendations regarding foreseeable issues:\n\n1. Accuracy-efficiency trade-off: The model uses a width multiplier \u03b1 of 0.75, which reduces the model size and computational cost but also leads to some accuracy drop compared to the baseline MobileNet (\u03b1=1). Users should be aware of this trade-off and evaluate if the reduced accuracy is acceptable for their specific use case.\n\n2. Limited application scope: The references mainly discuss MobileNet's performance on ImageNet classification and a few other tasks like object detection and face attributes. However, there is limited information on the model's generalizability to a wider range of applications. More extensive testing may be needed to assess the model's effectiveness in diverse domains.\n\n3. Potential biases: [More Information Needed] The references do not provide insights into any biases the model might have inherited from its training data. A thorough analysis of the training dataset and resulting biases is recommended to ensure responsible deployment.\n\n4. Robustness and security: [More Information Needed] The provided information does not cover the model's robustness against adversarial attacks or its security vulnerabilities. Further investigation into these aspects is crucial, especially if the model is applied in sensitive or high-stakes scenarios.\n\n5. Environmental impact: [More Information Needed] While the model's efficiency is discussed in terms of computational cost and latency, there is no mention of its environmental footprint. An assessment of the model's energy consumption and carbon emissions during training and inference would be valuable for users concerned about sustainability.\n\nIn summary, while google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192 offers a good balance between efficiency and accuracy, more information is needed to comprehensively address potential issues related to biases, robustness, security, and environmental impact. Users should carefully consider these aspects and gather additional insights before deploying the model in their specific contexts."}

The preprocessing steps for the input data of this model are as follows:\n\n1. Resizing: The input image is resized to a fixed size of 192x192 pixels using bilinear interpolation. This ensures that all input images have consistent dimensions before being fed into the model.\n\n2. Normalization: The pixel values of the resized image are normalized to a range of -1 to 1. This is done by dividing each pixel value by 127.5 and then subtracting 1. Normalization helps to center the pixel values around zero and scale them to a consistent range, which can improve the model's convergence and performance.\n\n3. Channel ordering: The model expects the input image to have three color channels (RGB) in a specific order. The channels are arranged in the following order: Red, Green, Blue (RGB). If the input image is in a different color space or channel order, it needs to be converted to RGB before being fed into the model.\n\n4. Batch dimension: The model expects the input to have a batch dimension, even if only a single image is being processed. Therefore, the preprocessed image is typically expanded to include a batch dimension of size 1, resulting in a shape of (1, 192, 192, 3).\n\nThese preprocessing steps are crucial to ensure that the input data is compatible with the model's architecture and training setup. By resizing, normalizing, and arranging the channels correctly, the model can effectively process the input images and generate accurate predictions.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps may vary slightly depending on the framework or library being used to load and run the model. However, the general principles of resizing, normalization, channel ordering, and adding a batch dimension remain consistent across different implementations.", "The google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192 model is an image classification model that expects input images to be preprocessed in a specific way before being passed through the network. The preprocessing steps for this model are as follows:\n\n1. Resizing: The input image is resized to a fixed size of 192x192 pixels. This is done to ensure that all images have consistent dimensions before being fed into the model. The resizing operation maintains the aspect ratio of the original image by padding the shorter side with zeros until it reaches the target size of 192 pixels.\n\n2. Normalization: After resizing, the pixel values of the image are normalized. The model expects pixel values to be in the range of -1 to 1. To achieve this, the pixel values are first scaled from the range of 0-255 to 0-1 by dividing each pixel value by 255. Then, the scaled pixel values are shifted to the range of -1 to 1 by subtracting 0.5 and multiplying by 2.\n\n3. Channel Order: The model expects the input image to have three color channels (RGB) in a specific order. The channels should be arranged in the order of Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). If the input image is in a different color format (e.g., BGR), it needs to be converted to RGB before being passed to the model.\n\nBy applying these preprocessing steps\u2014resizing to 192x192 pixels, normalizing pixel values to the range of -1 to 1, and ensuring the correct channel order\u2014the input image is transformed into a format that is compatible with the google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192 model.

Optimizer: MobileNet models are often trained using the RMSprop optimizer or the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with momentum.\n\n2. Learning rate: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter that determines the step size at which the model's weights are updated during training. A common learning rate for MobileNet models is in the range of 0.01 to 0.1, with possible learning rate decay applied during training.\n\n3. Batch size: The batch size defines the number of training examples used in each iteration of the training process. Typical batch sizes for MobileNet models range from 32 to 256, depending on the available computational resources.\n\n4.

We present a class of efficient models called MobileNets for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyperparameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive\n8. First we show results for MobileNet with depthwise separable convolutions compared to a model built with full convolutions. In Table 4 we see that using depthwise separable convolutions compared to full convolutions only reduces We next show results comparing thinner models with width multiplier to shallower models using less layers. To make MobileNet shallower, the 5 layers of separable filters with feature size 14 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 512 in Table 1 are removed.

We re-train PlaNet using the MobileNet architecture on the same data. While the full PlaNet model based on the Inception V3 architecture [31] has 52 million parameters and 5.74 billion mult-adds. The MobileNet model has only 13 million parameters with the usual 3 million for the body and 10 million for the final layer and 0.58 Million mult-adds.

We train MobileNet for fine grained recognition on the Stanford Dogs dataset [17]. We extend the approach of [18] and collect an even larger but noisy training set than [18] from the web. We use the noisy web data to pretrain a fine grained dog recognition model and then fine tune the model on the Stanford Dogs training set. Results on Stanford Dogs test set are in Table 10. MobileNet can almost achieve the state of the art results from [18] at greatly reduced computation and size.\n3. In this section we first investigate the effects of depthwise convolutions as well as the choice of shrinking by reducing the width of the network rather than the number of layers. We then show the trade offs of reducing the network based on the two hyper-parameters: width multiplier and resolution multiplier and compare results to a number of popular models. We then investigate MobileNets applied to a number of different applications.\n4. PlaNet [35] casts the task of determining where on earth a photo was taken as a classification problem. The approach divides the earth into a grid of geographic cells that serve as the target classes and trains a convolutional neural network on millions of geo-tagged photos. PlaNet has been shown to successfully localize a large variety of photos and to outperform Im2GPS [6,7] that addresses the same task.\n5. outperforms Im2GPS by a large margin.\n6. performances. It is evident from Tab. 12 that the MobileNet-based classifier is resilient to aggressive model shrinking: it achieves a similar mean average precision across attributes (mean AP) as the in-house while consuming only 1% the Multi-Adds.\n7. Another use-case for MobileNet is compressing large systems with unknown or esoteric training procedures. In a face attribute classification task, we demonstrate a synergistic relationship between MobileNet and distillation [9], a knowledge transfer technique for deep networks. We seek to reduce a large face attribute classifier with 75 million parameters and 1600 million Mult-Adds. The classifier is trained on a multi-attribute dataset similar to YFCC100M [32].\n8. We distill a face attribute classifier using the MobileNet architecture. Distillation [9] works by training the classifier to emulate the outputs of a larger model 2 instead of the ground-truth labels, hence enabling training from large (and potentially infinite) unlabeled datasets. Marrying the scalability of distillation training and the parsimonious parameterization of MobileNet, the end system not only requires no regularization (e.g. weight-decay and early-stopping), but also demonstrates enhanced\n9. experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification.

It is evident from Tab. 12 that the MobileNet-based classifier is resilient to aggressive model shrinking: it achieves a similar mean average precision across attributes (mean AP) as the in-house while consuming only 1% the Multi-Adds.\n11. MobileNet models were trained in TensorFlow [1] using RMSprop [33] with asynchronous gradient descent similar to Inception V3 [31]. However, contrary to training large models we use less regularization and data augmentation techniques because small models have less trouble with overfitting. When training MobileNets we do not use side heads or label smoothing and additionally reduce the amount image of distortions by limiting the size of small crops that are used in large Inception training [31].\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nWhat are the foreseeable characteristics that will influence how the model google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192 behaves?

MobileNet models were trained in TensorFlow [1] using RMSprop [33] with asynchronous gradient descent similar to Inception V3 [31]. However, contrary to training large models we use less regularization and data augmentation techniques because small models have less trouble with overfitting. When training MobileNets we do not use side heads or label smoothing and additionally reduce the amount image of distortions by limiting the size of small crops that are used in large Inception training [31].\n2. Table 6 shows the accuracy, computation and size trade offs of shrinking the MobileNet architecture with the width multiplier \u03b1. Accuracy drops off smoothly until the architecture is made too small at \u03b1 = 0.25.\nTable 7 shows the accuracy, computation and size trade offs for different resolution multipliers by training Mo-bileNets with reduced input resolutions. Accuracy drops off smoothly across resolution.\n3. where the computational cost depends multiplicatively on the number of input channels M , the number of output channels N the kernel size D k \u00d7 D k and the feature map size D F \u00d7 D F . MobileNet models address each of these terms and their interactions. First it uses depthwise separable convolutions to break the interaction between the number of output channels and the size of the kernel.

Although the base MobileNet architecture is already small and low latency, many times a specific use case or application may require the model to be smaller and faster. In order to construct these smaller and less computationally expensive models we introduce a very simple parameter \u03b1 called width multiplier. The role of the width multiplier \u03b1 is to thin a network uniformly at each layer. For a given layer  and width multiplier \u03b1, the number of input channels M becomes \u03b1M and the number of output channels N\n5.

The key architectural choices that contribute to its efficiency are:\n\n1. Depthwise separable convolutions: This breaks the interaction between the number of output channels and the kernel size, reducing computational cost.\n\n2. Width multiplier (\u03b1): This parameter allows uniformly thinning the network at each layer, reducing the number of input and output channels. For the model google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192, \u03b1 is set to 0.75, meaning the number of channels is reduced to 75% of the original MobileNet architecture.\n\n3. Resolution multiplier: MobileNets can be trained with reduced input resolutions, trading off accuracy for computational cost. The model google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192 has an input resolution of 192x192 pixels.\n\nThese architectural choices make the model more interpretable by reducing the complexity of the network while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

MobileNet uses 3 \u00d7 3 depthwise separable convolutions which uses between 8 to 9 times less computation than standard convolutions at only a small reduction in accuracy as seen in Section 4.\nAdditional factorization in spatial dimension such as in [16,31] does not save much additional computation as very little computation is spent in depthwise convolutions.\n.\n4. where the computational cost depends multiplicatively on the number of input channels M , the number of output channels N the kernel size D k \u00d7 D k and the feature map size D F \u00d7 D F . MobileNet models address each of these terms and their interactions. First it uses depthwise separable convolutions to break the interaction between the number of output channels and the size of the kernel. The standard convolution operation has the effect of filtering features based on the convolutional kernels and\n5. Depthwise separable convolution are made up of two layers: depthwise convolutions and pointwise convolutions. We use depthwise convolutions to apply a single filter per each input channel (input depth). Pointwise convolution, a simple 1\u00d71 convolution, is then used to create a linear combination of the output of the depthwise layer. MobileNets use both batchnorm and ReLU nonlinearities for both layers.\nDepthwise convolution with one filter per input channel (input depth) can be written as:\n6. We present a class of efficient models called MobileNets for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyperparameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive\n7. We proposed a new model architecture called Mo-bileNets based on depthwise separable convolutions. We investigated some of the important design decisions leading to an efficient model. We then demonstrated how to build smaller and faster MobileNets using width multiplier and resolution multiplier by trading off a reasonable amount of accuracy to reduce size and latency. We then compared different MobileNets to popular models demonstrating superior size, speed and accuracy characteristics. We concluded by\n8. This paper describes an efficient network architecture and a set of two hyper-parameters in order to build very small, low latency models that can be easily matched to the design requirements for mobile and embedded vision applications. Section 2 reviews prior work in building small models. Section 3 describes the MobileNet architecture and two hyper-parameters width multiplier and resolution multiplier to define smaller and more efficient MobileNets. Section 4 describes experiments on ImageNet as well a\n9. First we show results for MobileNet with depthwise separable convolutions compared to a model built with full convolutions. In Table 4 we see that using depthwise separable convolutions compared to full convolutions only reduces We next show results comparing thinner models with width multiplier to shallower models using less layers. To make MobileNet shallower, the 5 layers of separable filters with feature size 14 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 512 in Table 1 are removed. Table 5 shows that at similar computation and number of\n10.

Although the base MobileNet architecture is already small and low latency, many times a specific use case or application may require the model to be smaller and faster. In order to construct these smaller and less computationally expensive models we introduce a very simple parameter \u03b1 called width multiplier. The role of the width multiplier \u03b1 is to thin a network uniformly at each layer. For a given layer  and width multiplier \u03b1, the number of input channels M becomes \u03b1M and the number of output channels N\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the model architecture and objective about the model google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192.

This paper proposes a class of network architectures that allows a model developer to specifically choose a small network that matches the resource restrictions (latency, size) for their application. MobileNets primarily focus on optimizing for\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide the compute infrastructure about the model google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192. If you don't know the answer for a specific part, you should just say \"[More Information Needed]\". You can write code only if you find a direct code block reference from above, otherwise just output \"[More Information Needed]\". Your answer should be easy to read and succinct.\n"], "answer": "Based on the provided references, here is the information I can provide about the compute infrastructure used for the google/mobilenet_v1_0.75_192 model:\n\nThe MobileNet models were trained using TensorFlow with asynchronous gradient descent, similar to the training of the Inception V3 model. RMSprop optimizer was used for training.\n\nSome key points about the training infrastructure and methodology:\n\n- Less regularization and data augmentation techniques were used compared to training larger models, since smaller models like MobileNet have less trouble with overfitting. \n- Side heads, label smoothing were not used. The amount of image distortions was reduced by limiting the size of small crops used in training.\n- Most MobileNet layers are followed by batchnorm and ReLU, except the final fully connected layer which feeds into a softmax.\n- Very little or no weight decay (L2 regularization) was used on the depthwise filters since they have very few parameters.\n\n[More Information Needed] on the specific compute hardware, distributed training setup, training times, hyperparameters, etc. used for this particular MobileNet_v1_0.75_192 variant, as those details are not provided in the given references."}
