Starting from the baseline EfficientNet-B0, we apply our compound scaling method to scale it up with two steps:\n\u2022 STEP 1: we first fix \u03c6 = 1, assuming twice more resources available, and do a small grid search of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 based on Equation 2 and 3. In particular, we find the best values for EfficientNet-\nB0 are \u03b1 = 1.2, \u03b2 = 1.1, \u03b3 = 1.15, under constraint of \u03b1 \u2022 \u03b2 2 \u2022 \u03b3 2 \u2248 2.\n2. Since model scaling does not change layer operatorsF i in baseline network, having a good baseline network is also critical. We will evaluate our scaling method using existing ConvNets, but in order to better demonstrate the effectiveness of our scaling method, we have also developed a new mobile-size baseline, called EfficientNet.\n3. Notably, it is possible to achieve even better performance by searching for \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 directly around a large model, but the search cost becomes prohibitively more expensive on larger models. Our method solves this issue by only doing search once on the small baseline network (step 1), and then use the same scaling coefficients for all other models (step 2).\n4. \u2022 STEP 2: we then fix \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 as constants and scale up baseline network with different \u03c6 using Equation 3, to obtain EfficientNet-B1 to B7 (Details in Table 2).\n5. Inspired by (Tan et al., 2019), we develop our baseline network by leveraging a multi-objective neural architecture search that optimizes both accuracy and FLOPS. Specifically, we use the same search space as (Tan et al., 2019), and use ACC(m)\u00d7[F LOP S(m)/T ] w as the optimization goal, where ACC(m) and F LOP S(m) denote the accuracy and FLOPS of model m, T is the target FLOPS and w=-0.07 is a hyperparameter for controlling the trade-off between accuracy and FLOPS. Unlike (Tan et al., 2019;Cai et al.,\n6. demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets\n7. 2019), here we optimize FLOPS rather than latency since we are not targeting any specific hardware device. Our search produces an efficient network, which we name EfficientNet-B0. Since we use the same search space as (Tan et al., 2019), the architecture is similar to Mnas- Net, except our EfficientNet-B0 is slightly bigger due to the larger FLOPS target (our FLOPS target is 400M). Table 1 shows the architecture of EfficientNet-B0. Its main building block is mobile inverted bottleneck MBConv (Sandler et\n8. Scaling up ConvNets is widely used to achieve better accuracy. For example, ResNet (He et al., 2016) can be scaled up from ResNet-18 to ResNet-200 by using more layers; Recently, GPipe (Huang et al., 2018) achieved 84.3% Ima-geNet top-1 accuracy by scaling up a baseline model four 1 Google Research, Brain Team, Mountain View, CA.

To disentangle the contribution of our proposed scaling method from the EfficientNet architecture, Figure 8   ods for the same EfficientNet-B0 baseline network. In general, all scaling methods improve accuracy with the cost of more FLOPS, but our compound scaling method can further improve accuracy, by up to 2.5%, than other singledimension scaling methods, suggesting the importance of our proposed compound scaling.\n10. As a proof of concept, we first apply our scaling method to the widely-used MobileNets (Howard et al., 2017;Sandler et al., 2018) and ResNet (He et al., 2016). Table 3 shows the ImageNet results of scaling them in different ways. Compared to other single-dimension scaling methods, our compound scaling method improves the accuracy on all these models, suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed scaling method for general existing ConvNets.

Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient.

This is possible through a technique called \"feature extraction\" or \"transfer learning.\"\n\nIn feature extraction, the pre-trained model is used as a fixed feature extractor. The model's weights are frozen, and the last fully connected layer is replaced with a new layer that matches the number of classes in the target task. The input images are passed through the model, and the activations from the layer before the final classification layer are extracted. These activations serve as a compact and informative representation of the input images.\n\nThe extracted features can then be used to train a separate, simpler classifier, such as a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) or a Random Forest, on the target task. This approach leverages the knowledge learned by the pre-trained model on a large dataset, such as ImageNet, to quickly adapt to a new task without the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n\nUsing the google/efficientnet-b0 model for feature extraction is particularly useful when the target dataset is small, as training a deep neural network from scratch on a small dataset may lead to overfitting. By using the pre-trained model's features, one can achieve good performance on the target task with minimal computational resources and training time.", "The google/efficientnet-b0 model is a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) that can be used for image classification tasks without the need for post-processing. This model has been trained on the ImageNet dataset, which consists of over 1.2 million images across 1,000 different classes.\n\nTo use the model without post-processing, you can simply pass an input image through the network, and it will output a probability distribution over the 1,000 classes. The class with the highest probability is the predicted class for the input image. This means that you can directly use the model's output to determine the most likely class for a given image, without the need for any additional processing steps.\n\nThe efficientnet-b0 model is designed to be computationally efficient while still achieving high accuracy. It uses a compound scaling method that uniformly scales the network's depth, width, and resolution, allowing for a good balance between performance and computational cost. This makes it suitable for deployment on various devices, including those with limited resources, without sacrificing too much accuracy.\n\nIn summary, the google/efficientnet-b0 model can be used directly for image classification tasks without any post-processing requirements, making it a convenient and efficient choice for many applications.", "The google/efficientnet-b0 model is a pre-trained image classification model that can be used without plugging into a pipeline.

While it has shown impressive performance and efficiency, there are some potential harms and limitations to consider:\n\n1. Bias and fairness: The model's performance may be biased if the training data is not representative of the real-world population. This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes when the model is applied to certain demographic groups.\n\n2. Privacy concerns: If the model is trained on sensitive or personal data, there is a risk of privacy breaches or misuse of the information.\n\n3. Misuse and unintended consequences: The model could be used for malicious purposes, such as surveillance or generating deepfakes, which can have serious social and ethical implications.\n\n4. Overreliance and lack of interpretability: As with many deep learning models, EfficientNet-b0 is a \"black box\" model, meaning its decision-making process is not easily interpretable. Overreliance on such models without human oversight can lead to unintended consequences.\n\n5. Environmental impact: Training large neural networks like EfficientNet-b0 requires significant computational resources, which can contribute to a high carbon footprint and environmental concerns.\n\nIt is essential to consider these potential harms and address them through responsible development, deployment, and monitoring of the model. This includes ensuring data privacy, promoting transparency, and actively mitigating biases in the training data and model outputs.", "The Google EfficientNet-B0 model is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for image classification tasks. While it has demonstrated impressive performance, there are a few potential misunderstandings or limitations to consider:\n\n1. Model size and complexity: Although EfficientNet-B0 is the smallest variant in the EfficientNet family, it may still be considered a relatively large and complex model compared to simpler architectures. This can lead to the misunderstanding that it is always the best choice, even for smaller datasets or less complex problems.\n\n2. Transfer learning assumptions: EfficientNet-B0 is often used with pre-trained weights from ImageNet, a large-scale dataset. However, the assumption that these pre-trained weights will always yield optimal results for every downstream task may not hold true, especially if the target domain differs significantly from ImageNet.\n\n3. Robustness to adversarial attacks: Like many deep learning models, EfficientNet-B0 can be vulnerable to adversarial examples \u2013 carefully crafted inputs designed to fool the model. Misunderstanding the model's robustness to such attacks may lead to overconfidence in its performance in adversarial settings.\n\n4. Interpretability: The complex architecture of EfficientNet-B0 can make it challenging to interpret the model's decisions and understand the features it relies on for classification. This lack of interpretability may be misunderstood as a lack of reliability or trustworthiness.\n\n5. Generalization to out-of-distribution data: While EfficientNet-B0 can achieve high accuracy on test data similar to its training data, its performance on out-of-distribution samples (i.e., data significantly different from the training distribution) may be overestimated. This can lead to misunderstandings about the model's generalization capabilities.\n\nIt is essential to be aware of these potential misunderstandings and limitations when considering the use of EfficientNet-B0 or any other deep learning model for a specific task.", "The google/efficientnet-b0 model, while being a powerful and efficient image classification model, has some known and foreseeable technical limitations:\n\n1. Limited context understanding: As a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image classification, EfficientNet-B0 lacks the ability to understand the broader context or relationships between objects in an image. It focuses on identifying and classifying individual objects rather than comprehending the overall scene.\n\n2. Fixed input size: EfficientNet-B0 requires a fixed input size of 224x224 pixels. Images that are larger or smaller need to be resized, which can lead to a loss of information or distortion, potentially affecting the model's performance.\n\n3. Limited ability to handle occlusion and truncation: If objects in an image are partially occluded or truncated, the model may struggle to accurately classify them. This is because the model relies on the presence of key features and patterns, which may be obscured in such cases.\n\n4. Sensitivity to adversarial attacks: Like many deep learning models, EfficientNet-B0 can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Carefully crafted perturbations to input images can cause the model to misclassify them, raising concerns about the model's robustness and reliability in certain scenarios.\n\n5. Lack of explainability: EfficientNet-B0, as a deep neural network, operates as a \"black box,\" making it difficult to interpret how the model arrives at its predictions. This lack of explainability can be a limitation in domains where understanding the reasoning behind a classification is crucial.\n\n6. Domain shift and generalization: Models like EfficientNet-B0 are trained on specific datasets, and their performance may degrade when applied to images from domains that differ significantly from the training data. Generalization to new and unseen domains can be challenging.\n\nIt's important to consider these limitations when applying EfficientNet-B0 to real-world problems and to be aware of potential issues that may arise in specific use cases.", "The Google EfficientNet-B0 model, while being a powerful and efficient image classification model, does have some known and potential sociotechnical limitations:\n\n1. Bias in training data: Like many deep learning models, EfficientNet-B0 may inherit biases present in the training data. If the dataset used for training is not diverse or representative enough, the model might perform poorly or make biased predictions for underrepresented groups or scenarios.\n\n2. Limited context understanding: EfficientNet-B0 is primarily designed for image classification tasks and lacks the ability to understand the broader context or reasoning behind the images. This limitation may lead to misinterpretations or incorrect predictions in complex real-world situations.\n\n3. Adversarial attacks: Deep learning models, including EfficientNet-B0, are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Maliciously crafted input images can deceive the model, causing it to make incorrect predictions. This raises concerns about the model's robustness and reliability in critical applications.\n\n4. Lack of explainability: EfficientNet-B0, like many deep learning models, operates as a \"black box,\" making it difficult to interpret and explain its decision-making process. This lack of transparency can be problematic in domains where accountability and trust are crucial, such as healthcare or legal systems.\n\n5. Computational resources: While EfficientNet-B0 is designed to be more efficient compared to other models, it still requires significant computational resources for training and inference. This may limit its accessibility and deployment in resource-constrained environments.\n\n6. Generalization to unseen data: The model's performance on unseen or out-of-distribution data may be uncertain. It is important to evaluate the model's generalization capabilities and robustness to ensure reliable performance in real-world scenarios.\n\nAddressing these limitations requires ongoing research and development efforts, such as improving dataset diversity, developing techniques for model interpretability, enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks, and optimizing computational efficiency.

However, scaling up the model to achieve higher accuracy comes at the cost of increased computational resources (FLOPS) and parameters. Deploying very large versions of EfficientNet could be challenging in resource-constrained environments.\n\nGeneralization and Transfer Learning:\nWhile the references suggest EfficientNets perform well on ImageNet and some transfer learning datasets, more information is needed on their generalization capabilities across a wider range of computer vision tasks and domains. Thorough testing on diverse datasets and real-world applications would help assess potential limitations.\n\nInterpretability and Bias:\n[More Information Needed] \nThe provided references do not discuss issues related to interpretability of EfficientNet predictions or potential biases learned from training data. Analyzing class activation maps is a good start, but further studies on fairness, transparency and potential failure modes would be valuable.\n\nComparison to Other Architectures:\nThe references focus on comparing EfficientNet to other scaling methods, but more comprehensive comparisons to other state-of-the-art architectures across multiple metrics (accuracy, efficiency, robustness, etc.) would give a clearer picture of its relative strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn summary, while EfficientNets show promising results, it's important to thoroughly validate their performance, assess computational requirements, examine potential biases, and test generalization before deploying them in high-stakes applications.

Performance on other computer vision domains like object detection or specialized image domains would need further evaluation.\n\nPopulation Subgroups:\n[More Information Needed] \nThe references do not provide information on how the model performs across different population subgroups or image categories. To uncover any performance disparities, the model would need to be evaluated on relevant subgroups, such as across different demographics, skin tones, object categories, etc.\n\nOther Factors:\n- Model size: The EfficientNet-B0 is a relatively small model compared to the larger variants like B7. The compact size may lead to some accuracy tradeoffs.\n- Training regularization: Dropout ratio and other regularization techniques were increased for larger models. The B0 model uses less regularization which could impact generalization.\n- Activation function: The model uses SiLU/Swish-1 activation which may have different properties than other activations.\n\nIn summary, while EfficientNet-B0 is a capable general image classifier, more targeted evaluation would be needed to characterize its performance across specific subgroups and uncover any disparities. The model's size and training regularization are also important factors to consider."}

Techniques like regularization and data augmentation help strike a balance between fitting the training data and maintaining good generalization capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the key tradeoffs in the EfficientNet-B0 model involve balancing accuracy, efficiency, and generalization.

We will evaluate our scaling method using existing ConvNets, but in order to better demonstrate the effectiveness of our scaling method, we have also developed a new mobile-size baseline, called EfficientNet.\n4. As a proof of concept, we first apply our scaling method to the widely-used MobileNets (Howard et al., 2017;Sandler et al., 2018) and ResNet (He et al., 2016).

Starting from the baseline EfficientNet-B0, we apply our compound scaling method to scale it up with two steps:\n\u2022 STEP 1: we first fix \u03c6 = 1, assuming twice more resources available, and do a small grid search of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 based on Equation 2 and 3.

Unlike regular ConvNet designs that mostly focus on finding the best layer architecture F i , model scaling tries to expand the network length (L i ), width (C i ), and/or resolution (H i , W i ) without changing F i predefined in the baseline network.
