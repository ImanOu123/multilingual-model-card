DETR is an end-to-end object detection model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Transformers.\n\nThe architecture consists of three main components:\n\n1. Backbone: A ResNet-50 CNN is used as the backbone to extract features from the input image. The ResNet-50 is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, which allows the model to learn general image features.\n\n2. Transformer Encoder: The extracted features from the backbone are then passed through a Transformer encoder, which learns the global context and relationships between different regions of the image.\n\n3. Transformer Decoder: The decoder takes the encoded features and learns to predict the bounding boxes and class labels for the objects in the image. The decoder also utilizes object queries, which are learned embeddings that help the model focus on specific regions of the image.\n\nThe DETR architecture is known for its simplicity and ability to handle a variable number of objects in an image without the need for complex post-processing steps like non-maximum suppression (NMS).

The training process involves the following key aspects:\n\n1. Backbone: The ResNet-50 convolutional neural network is used as the backbone to extract features from the input images. The weights of the ResNet-50 are initialized with pre-trained values from ImageNet classification.\n\n2. Transformer Encoder-Decoder: The DETR architecture consists of a transformer encoder-decoder structure. The encoder takes the features extracted by the ResNet-50 backbone and applies self-attention to capture global context. The decoder then attends to the encoded features and generates object queries, which are used to predict the bounding boxes and class labels.\n\n3. Bipartite Matching Loss: DETR uses a bipartite matching loss to assign predicted bounding boxes to ground truth objects. This loss function encourages the model to predict a set of bounding boxes that closely match the ground truth objects in the image.\n\n4. Optimization: The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a weight decay of 1e-4. The training is conducted for 500 epochs with a batch size of 16 on 8 GPUs.\n\n5. Data Augmentation: During training, various data augmentation techniques are applied, such as random horizontal flipping, random resizing, and random cropping, to improve the model's robustness and generalization ability.\n\n6. Inference: At inference time, the model takes an input image and generates a set of object queries.

Backbone: The model uses a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) as the backbone for feature extraction. ResNet-50 has around 25.6 million parameters.\n\n2. Transformer Encoder: The transformer encoder consists of 6 layers, each with a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network (FFN).

The bounding box head predicts the normalized center coordinates, height, and width of the boxes, while the classification head predicts the class probabilities.\n\nThe total number of parameters in the Facebook DETR-ResNet-50 model is approximately 41 million.

One of the main difficulties of training is to score predicted objects (class, position, size) with respect to the ground truth. Our loss produces an optimal bipartite matching between predicted and ground truth objects, and then optimize object-specific (bounding box) losses."]}

We train DETR with AdamW setting learning rate in the transformer to 1e-4 and 1e-5 in the backbone.\nHorizontal flips, scales and crops are used for augmentation.\nImages are rescaled to have min size 800 and max size 1333.\nThe transformer is trained with dropout of 0.1, and the whole model is trained with grad clip of 0.1.\n2. We show that DETR achieves competitive results compared to Faster R-CNN in quantitative evaluation on COCO. Then, we provide a detailed ablation study of the architecture and loss, with insights and qualitative results. Finally, to show that DETR is a versatile and extensible model, we present results on panoptic segmentation, training only a small extension on a fixed DETR model. We provide code and pretrained models to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr.\n3. Two ingredients are essential for direct set predictions in detection: (1) a set prediction loss that forces unique matching between predicted and ground truth boxes; (2) an architecture that predicts (in a single pass) a set of objects and models their relation. We describe our architecture in detail in Figure 2.\n4. We recommend training segmentation in two stages: first train DETR to detect all the boxes, and then train the segmentation head.\nFor panoptic segmentation, DETR must learn to detect boxes for both stuff and things classes. You can train it on a single node with 8 gpus for 300 epochs with:\n```\npython -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env main.py --coco_path /path/to/coco  --coco_panoptic_path /path/to/coco_panoptic --dataset_file coco_panoptic --output_dir /output/path/box_model\n```\n5. To train baseline DETR on a single node with 8 gpus for 300 epochs run:\n```\npython -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env main.py --coco_path /path/to/coco \n```\nA single epoch takes 28 minutes, so 300 epoch training\ntakes around 6 days on a single machine with 8 V100 cards.\nTo ease reproduction of our results we provide\n[results and training logs](https://gist.github.com/szagoruyko/b4c3b2c3627294fc369b899987385a3f)\n6. The overall DETR architecture is surprisingly simple and depicted in Figure 2. It contains three main components, which we describe below: a CNN backbone to extract a compact feature representation, an encoder-decoder transformer, and a simple feed forward network (FFN) that makes the final detection prediction. Unlike many modern detectors, DETR can be implemented in any deep learning framework that provides a common CNN backbone and a transformer architecture implementation with just a few hundred lines.\n7. We present a new method that views object detection as a direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer\n8. encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection\n9. Our DEtection TRansformer (DETR, see Figure 1) predicts all objects at once, and is trained end-to-end with a set loss function which performs bipartite matching between predicted and ground-truth objects. DETR simplifies the detection pipeline by dropping multiple hand-designed components that encode prior knowledge, like spatial anchors or non-maximal suppression. Unlike most existing detection methods, DETR doesn't require any customized layers, and thus can be reproduced easily in any framework that\n10.

The detailed description of the transformer used in DETR, with positional encodings passed at every attention layer, is given in Fig. 10. Image features from the CNN backbone are passed through the transformer encoder, together with spatial positional encoding that are added to queries and keys at every multihead self-attention layer.

Fine-tuning involves adapting the pre-trained model to a specific dataset or task by training it further on task-specific data.\n\nWhen fine-tuned for a particular task, the DETR model can learn to detect and localize objects of interest in images relevant to that task. For example, if you have a dataset of images containing different types of vehicles, you can fine-tune the DETR model on this dataset. During fine-tuning, the model's weights are adjusted to optimize its performance on the vehicle detection task. The model learns to recognize and localize vehicles in the images based on the patterns and features it has learned from the task-specific dataset.\n\nAfter fine-tuning, the model can be used to detect and localize vehicles in new, unseen images. It will output bounding boxes around the detected vehicles along with their corresponding class labels (e.g., car, truck, motorcycle). This fine-tuned model can be integrated into various applications, such as autonomous driving systems, traffic monitoring, or vehicle tracking.\n\nThe fine-tuning process allows the DETR model to adapt its knowledge and capabilities to the specific requirements of the task at hand.

This can enhance the user experience by enabling features like intelligent image search, automated content categorization, or even generating descriptive alt-text for visually impaired users.\n\nIn a surveillance or security system, the model can be employed to detect and track objects of interest in real-time video feeds.

{"question": "bias_recommendations", "chain": "rev_retrieval", "prompt": ["When considering the Facebook DETR (DEtection TRansformer) model with a ResNet-50 backbone, there are a few foreseeable issues to keep in mind:\n\n1. Computational complexity: The DETR model, especially when paired with a ResNet-50 backbone, can be computationally expensive due to the self-attention mechanism in the transformer architecture. This may result in slower inference times compared to traditional object detection models, particularly on resource-constrained devices.\n\n2. Limited real-time performance: Due to the computational complexity, the DETR model may not be suitable for real-time object detection tasks that require fast processing speeds, such as video surveillance or autonomous driving applications.\n\n3. Sensitivity to object scale: The DETR model may struggle with detecting objects at vastly different scales within the same image. This is because the model uses a fixed number of object queries, which may not effectively capture objects of varying sizes.\n\n4. Requirement for large-scale training data: To achieve optimal performance, the DETR model requires training on large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. Collecting and annotating such datasets can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n\n5. Potential for false positives: Like other object detection models, DETR may generate false positive detections, especially in complex scenes with many objects or in the presence of occlusions and clutter.\n\n6.

We show that DETR achieves competitive results compared to Faster R-CNN in quantitative evaluation on COCO. Then, we provide a detailed ablation study of the architecture and loss, with insights and qualitative results. Finally, to show that DETR is a versatile and extensible model, we present results on panoptic segmentation, training only a small extension on a fixed DETR model. We provide code and pretrained models to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr.\n2. We perform experiments on COCO 2017 detection and panoptic segmentation datasets [24,18], containing 118k training images and 5k validation images. Each image is annotated with bounding boxes and panoptic segmentation. There are 7 instances per image on average, up to 63 instances in a single image in training set, ranging from small to large on the same images. If not specified, we report AP as bbox AP, the integral metric over multiple thresholds.\n3. Technical details. We train DETR with AdamW [26] setting the initial transformer's learning rate to 10 \u22124 , the backbone's to 10 \u22125 , and weight decay to 10 \u22124 . All transformer weights are initialized with Xavier init [11], and the backbone is with ImageNet-pretrained ResNet model [15] from torchvision with frozen batchnorm layers. We report results with two different backbones: a ResNet-50 and a ResNet-101. The corresponding models are called respectively DETR and DETR-R101. Following [21], we also\n4. For panoptic segmentation, you need the panoptic annotations additionally to the coco dataset (see above for the coco dataset). You need to download and extract the [annotations](http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/panoptic_annotations_trainval2017.zip).\nWe expect the directory structure to be the following:\n```\npath/to/coco_panoptic/\n  annotations/  # annotation json files\n  panoptic_train2017/    # train panoptic annotations\n  panoptic_val2017/      # val panoptic annotations\n```\n5. We use scale augmentation, resizing the input images such that the shortest side is at least 480 and at most 800 pixels while the longest at most 1333 [50]. To help learning global relationships through the self-attention of the encoder, we also apply random crop augmentations during training, improving the performance by approximately 1 AP. Specifically, a train image is cropped with probability 0.5 to a random rectangular patch which is then resized again to 800-1333. The transformer is trained with\n6. Other training hyperparameters can be found in section A.4. For our ablation experiments we use training schedule of 300 epochs with a learning rate drop by a factor of 10 after 200 epochs, where a single epoch is a pass over all training images once. Training the baseline model for 300 epochs on 16 V100 GPUs takes 3 days, with 4 images per GPU (hence a total batch size of 64). For the longer schedule used to compare with Faster R-CNN we train for 500 epochs with learning rate drop after 400 epochs.

Training details. We train DETR, DETR-DC5 and DETR-R101 models following the recipe for bounding box detection to predict boxes around stuff and things classes in COCO dataset. The new mask head is trained for 25 epochs (see supplementary for details).

More recent detectors [37,23,53] use non-unique assignment rules between ground truth and predictions together with an NMS.\n6. Backbone ImageNet pretrained backbone ResNet-50 is imported from Torchvision, discarding the last classification layer. Backbone batch normalization weights and statistics are frozen during training, following widely adopted practice in object detection. We fine-tune the backbone using learning rate of 10 \u22125 . We observe that having the backbone learning rate roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the rest of the network is important to stabilize training, especially in the first few epochs.\n7. Transformer We train the transformer with a learning rate of 10 \u22124 . Additive dropout of 0.1 is applied after every multi-head attention and FFN before layer normalization. The weights are randomly initialized with Xavier initialization.\nLosses We use linear combination of 1 and GIoU losses for bounding box regression with \u03bb L1 = 5 and \u03bb iou = 2 weights respectively. All models were trained with N = 100 decoder query slots.\n8. The detailed description of the transformer used in DETR, with positional encodings passed at every attention layer, is given in Fig. 10. Image features from the CNN backbone are passed through the transformer encoder, together with spatial positional encoding that are added to queries and keys at every multihead self-attention layer. Then, the decoder receives queries (initially set to zero), output positional encoding (object queries), and encoder memory, and produces the final set of predicted class\n9. Our DEtection TRansformer (DETR, see Figure 1) predicts all objects at once, and is trained end-to-end with a set loss function which performs bipartite matching between predicted and ground-truth objects. DETR simplifies the detection pipeline by dropping multiple hand-designed components that encode prior knowledge, like spatial anchors or non-maximal suppression. Unlike most existing detection methods, DETR doesn't require any customized layers, and thus can be reproduced easily in any framework that\n10. Attention mechanisms in the transformer decoder are the key components which model relations between feature representations of different detections. In our ablation analysis, we explore how other components of our architecture and loss influence the final performance. For the study we choose ResNet-50-based DETR model with 6 encoder, 6 decoder layers and width 256. The model has 41.3M parameters, achieves 40.6 and 42.0 AP on short and long schedules respectively, and runs at 28 FPS, similarly to Faster\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nProvide detail tokenization, resizing/rewriting (depending on the modality), etc. about the preprocessing for the data of the model facebook/detr-resnet-50.\n```\n\nPlease refer to the above contents of \"References\" as the knowledge source to answer the question about your model facebook/detr-resnet-50.

Transformer We train the transformer with a learning rate of 10 \u22124 . Additive dropout of 0.1 is applied after every multi-head attention and FFN before layer normalization. The weights are randomly initialized with Xavier initialization.\nLosses We use linear combination of 1 and GIoU losses for bounding box regression with \u03bb L1 = 5 and \u03bb iou = 2 weights respectively. All models were trained with N = 100 decoder query slots.\n2. We train DETR with AdamW setting learning rate in the transformer to 1e-4 and 1e-5 in the backbone.\nHorizontal flips, scales and crops are used for augmentation.\nImages are rescaled to have min size 800 and max size 1333.\nThe transformer is trained with dropout of 0.1, and the whole model is trained with grad clip of 0.1.\n3. We show that DETR achieves competitive results compared to Faster R-CNN in quantitative evaluation on COCO. Then, we provide a detailed ablation study of the architecture and loss, with insights and qualitative results. Finally, to show that DETR is a versatile and extensible model, we present results on panoptic segmentation, training only a small extension on a fixed DETR model. We provide code and pretrained models to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr.\n4. Backbone ImageNet pretrained backbone ResNet-50 is imported from Torchvision, discarding the last classification layer. Backbone batch normalization weights and statistics are frozen during training, following widely adopted practice in object detection. We fine-tune the backbone using learning rate of 10 \u22125 . We observe that having the backbone learning rate roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the rest of the network is important to stabilize training, especially in the first few epochs.\n5. Baseline Our enhanced Faster-RCNN+ baselines use GIoU [38] loss along with the standard 1 loss for bounding box regression. We performed a grid search to find the best weights for the losses and the final models use only GIoU loss with weights 20 and 1 for box and proposal regression tasks respectively. For the baselines we adopt the same data augmentation as used in DETR and train it with 9\u00d7 schedule (approximately 109 epochs). All other settings are identical to the same models in the Detectron2 model\n6. To train baseline DETR on a single node with 8 gpus for 300 epochs run:\n```\npython -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env main.py --coco_path /path/to/coco \n```\nA single epoch takes 28 minutes, so 300 epoch training\ntakes around 6 days on a single machine with 8 V100 cards.\nTo ease reproduction of our results we provide\n[results and training logs](https://gist.github.com/szagoruyko/b4c3b2c3627294fc369b899987385a3f)\n7.

This suggests robustness to some distribution shift in instance counts.\n\nPopulation Subgroups:\n- [More Information Needed] The references do not provide a detailed breakdown of performance across different object categories, sizes, frequencies, etc. Evaluation disaggregated along these factors would help uncover any performance disparities.\n\n- The model with a dilated C5 stage (DETR-DC5) is reported to improve small object detection at increased computational cost, indicating potential trade-offs.\n\nOther Factors:\n- Different object query slots in the decoder specialize to different object sizes and locations. The distribution of objects in the training data (COCO) likely influences this.\n\n- The model is competitive with Faster R-CNN in quantitative evaluation on COCO. Detailed comparisons to other architectures would further characterize its relative strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn summary, key factors are the natural images domain it was trained on, ability to generalize to unseen numbers of instances, and specialization of object query slots.

Some extra qualitative results for the panoptic prediction of the DETR-R101 model are shown in Fig. 11. Increasing the number of instances By design, DETR cannot predict more objects than it has query slots, i.e. 100 in our experiments.

Transformers are typically trained with Adam or Adagrad optimizers with very long training schedules and dropout, and this is true for DETR as well. Faster R-CNN, however, is trained with SGD with minimal data augmentation and we are not aware of successful applications of Adam or dropout.

Then, we provide a detailed ablation study of the architecture and loss, with insights and qualitative results. Finally, to show that DETR is a versatile and extensible model, we present results on panoptic segmentation, training only a small extension on a fixed DETR model. We provide code and pretrained models to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr.\n2. Transformer We train the transformer with a learning rate of 10 \u22124 . Additive dropout of 0.1 is applied after every multi-head attention and FFN before layer normalization. The weights are randomly initialized with Xavier initialization.\nLosses We use linear combination of 1 and GIoU losses for bounding box regression with \u03bb L1 = 5 and \u03bb iou = 2 weights respectively. All models were trained with N = 100 decoder query slots.\n3. Baseline Our enhanced Faster-RCNN+ baselines use GIoU [38] loss along with the standard 1 loss for bounding box regression. We performed a grid search to find the best weights for the losses and the final models use only GIoU loss with weights 20 and 1 for box and proposal regression tasks respectively. For the baselines we adopt the same data augmentation as used in DETR and train it with 9\u00d7 schedule (approximately 109 epochs). All other settings are identical to the same models in the Detectron2 model\n4. Backbone ImageNet pretrained backbone ResNet-50 is imported from Torchvision, discarding the last classification layer. Backbone batch normalization weights and statistics are frozen during training, following widely adopted practice in object detection. We fine-tune the backbone using learning rate of 10 \u22125 . We observe that having the backbone learning rate roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the rest of the network is important to stabilize training, especially in the first few epochs.\n5. We train DETR using AdamW [26] with improved weight decay handling, set to 10 \u22124 . We also apply gradient clipping, with a maximal gradient norm of 0.1. The backbone and the transformers are treated slightly differently, we now discuss the details for both.\n6. Other training hyperparameters can be found in section A.4. For our ablation experiments we use training schedule of 300 epochs with a learning rate drop by a factor of 10 after 200 epochs, where a single epoch is a pass over all training images once. Training the baseline model for 300 epochs on 16 V100 GPUs takes 3 days, with 4 images per GPU (hence a total batch size of 64). For the longer schedule used to compare with Faster R-CNN we train for 500 epochs with learning rate drop after 400 epochs. This\n7.

All transformer weights are initialized with Xavier init [11], and the backbone is with ImageNet-pretrained ResNet model [15] from torchvision with frozen batchnorm layers.

The model architecture can be described as follows:\n\n1. Backbone: The model uses a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) as the backbone to extract features from the input image. The ResNet-50 is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and serves as a feature extractor.\n\n2. Transformer Encoder: The features extracted by the ResNet-50 backbone are then passed through a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks (FFNs). The self-attention mechanism allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and relationships between different regions of the image.\n\n3. Transformer Decoder: The transformer decoder takes the output of the encoder and a set of learned object queries as input. The object queries are used to attend to different regions of the image and generate bounding box predictions and class labels. The decoder also consists of multiple layers of self-attention and FFNs, similar to the encoder.\n\n4. Prediction Heads: The output of the transformer decoder is passed through prediction heads to generate the final object detection results. There are two prediction heads: one for bounding box regression and another for object classification. The bounding box regression head predicts the coordinates of the bounding boxes, while the classification head predicts the class labels for each detected object.\n\nThe DETR architecture introduces a new approach to object detection by treating it as a direct set prediction problem. It eliminates the need for hand-designed components like anchor boxes and non-maximum suppression, which are commonly used in traditional object detection models. The transformer architecture allows the model to reason about the relationships between objects in the image and make predictions in a single forward pass.\n\nThe facebook/detr-resnet-50 model is pretrained on the COCO dataset, which contains a large collection of images with annotated objects from 80 different categories. This pretraining allows the model to learn robust feature representations and object detection capabilities that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or applied to new datasets.", "The objective of the facebook/detr-resnet-50 model is to perform object detection and panoptic segmentation tasks in computer vision. DETR, which stands for DEtection TRansformer, is an end-to-end object detection model that utilizes a transformer architecture to directly predict a set of object bounding boxes and class labels in an image. The model aims to simplify the object detection pipeline by eliminating the need for hand-designed components like anchor generation and non-maximum suppression, which are commonly used in traditional object detection approaches. By leveraging the power of transformers and a ResNet-50 backbone, the facebook/detr-resnet-50 model strives to achieve accurate and efficient object detection and segmentation results."]}
