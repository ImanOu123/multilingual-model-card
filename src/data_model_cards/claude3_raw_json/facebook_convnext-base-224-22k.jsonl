Typically, the stem cell design is concerned with how the input images will be processed at the network's beginning. Due to the redundancy inherent in natural images, a common stem cell will aggressively downsample the input images to an appropriate feature map size in both standard ConvNets and vision Transformers.

At a high level, our explorations are directed to investigate and follow different levels of designs from a Swin Transformer while maintaining the network's simplicity as a standard ConvNet. The roadmap of our exploration is as follows. Our starting point is a ResNet-50 model. We first train it with similar training techniques used to train vision Transformers and obtain much improved results compared to the original ResNet-50. This will be our baseline. We then study a series of design decisions which we\n2. Changing stem to \"Patchify\". Typically, the stem cell design is concerned with how the input images will be processed at the network's beginning. Due to the redundancy inherent in natural images, a common stem cell will aggressively downsample the input images to an appropriate feature map size in both standard ConvNets and vision Transformers. The stem cell in standard ResNet contains a 7\u00d77 convolution layer with stride 2, followed by a max pool, which results in a 4\u00d7 downsampling of the input images. In\n3. vision Transformers, a more aggressive \"patchify\" strategy is used as the stem cell, which corresponds to a large kernel size (e.g. kernel size = 14 or 16) and non-overlapping convolution. Swin Transformer uses a similar \"patchify\" layer, but with a smaller patch size of 4 to accommodate the architecture's multi-stage design. We replace the ResNet-style stem cell with a patchify layer implemented using a 4\u00d74, stride 4 convolutional layer. The accuracy has changed from 79.4% to 79.5%. This suggests that the\n4.

The variants only differ in the number of channels C, and the number of blocks B in each stage. Following both ResNets and Swin Transformers, the number of channels doubles at each new stage.

Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and adapting its weights to a specific task using a smaller dataset relevant to the target problem.\n\nTo fine-tune the ConvNeXt base model for a specific task, you would typically replace the last layer of the model with a new layer tailored to your task, such as a classification layer with the appropriate number of output classes. You then train the model using your task-specific dataset, allowing the weights of the pre-trained layers to be updated slightly while the new layer learns to map the features extracted by the base model to the desired outputs.\n\nBy leveraging the knowledge gained by the ConvNeXt base model during its pre-training on a large dataset (22k classes), you can achieve high performance on your specific task with a relatively small amount of task-specific data. This is particularly useful when you have limited labeled data for your task, as the pre-trained model has already learned to extract meaningful features from images.\n\nSome examples of tasks where fine-tuning the ConvNeXt base model can be effective include:\n\n1. Image classification: Identifying objects, scenes, or activities in images.\n2. Object detection: Locating and classifying objects within an image.\n3. Semantic segmentation: Assigning a class label to each pixel in an image.\n4.

When plugged into a broader system, this model can serve as a powerful tool for image classification, object detection, and feature extraction.\n\nFor instance, in a mobile app designed for plant identification, the convnext-base-224-22k model can be employed to accurately classify images of plants captured by users. The app can leverage the model's pre-trained knowledge to provide users with information about the plant species, its characteristics, and even care instructions.\n\nSimilarly, in a content moderation system for a social media platform, this model can be utilized to automatically detect and flag inappropriate or offensive images. By analyzing the visual content using the convnext-base-224-22k model, the system can efficiently identify and remove images that violate the platform's guidelines, enhancing the user experience and maintaining a safe online environment.\n\nFurthermore, the model's feature extraction capabilities can be harnessed in a recommendation engine for an e-commerce website. By understanding the visual attributes of products through the convnext-base-224-22k model, the recommendation system can suggest visually similar items to users, improving product discoverability and potentially boosting sales.\n\nIn summary, the facebook/convnext-base-224-22k model's versatility and robustness make it a valuable asset when integrated into a larger ecosystem or application.

We conduct a lightweight sweep for COCO experiments including learning rate {1e-4, 2e-4}, layer-wise learning rate decay [6] {0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95}, and stochastic depth rate {0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8}. We fine-tune the ImageNet-22K pre-trained Swin-B/L on COCO using the same sweep. We use the official code and pre-trained model weights [3].\n4. The hyperparameters we sweep for ADE20K experiments include learning rate {8e-5, 1e-4}, layer-wise learning rate decay {0.8, 0.9}, and stochastic depth rate {0.3, 0.4, 0.5}. We report validation mIoU results using multi-scale testing. Additional single-scale testing results are in Table 7.\n5. We construct different ConvNeXt variants, ConvNeXt-T/S/B/L, to be of similar complexities to Swin-T/S/B/L [45]. ConvNeXt-T/B is the end product of the \"modernizing\" procedure on ResNet-50/200 regime, respectively. In addition, we build a larger ConvNeXt-XL to further test the scalability of ConvNeXt. The variants only differ in the number of channels C, and the number of blocks B in each stage. Following both ResNets and Swin Transformers, the number of channels doubles at each new stage.

While it has demonstrated strong performance on various benchmarks, there are some potential misunderstandings or limitations to consider:\n\n1. Generalization: The model's performance may not always generalize well to real-world scenarios or datasets that differ significantly from the training data. It is important to evaluate the model's performance on diverse and representative datasets before deploying it in production.\n\n2. Bias: Like any machine learning model, the facebook/convnext-base-224-22k model may inherit biases present in the training data. If the training data contains biases related to factors such as race, gender, or cultural representation, the model's predictions may reflect those biases. It is crucial to carefully examine and mitigate potential biases to ensure fair and unbiased predictions.\n\n3. Adversarial attacks: CNNs, including the facebook/convnext-base-224-22k model, can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial examples are carefully crafted inputs designed to deceive the model and cause misclassifications. While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with adversarial attacks when deploying the model in sensitive applications.\n\n4. Interpretability: Deep learning models, including the facebook/convnext-base-224-22k model, are often considered \"black boxes\" due to their complex internal representations. Understanding how the model arrives at its predictions can be challenging, which may raise concerns in domains where interpretability and explainability are crucial, such as healthcare or legal applications.\n\n5. Domain shift: The model's performance may degrade when applied to data from a different domain or distribution than the training data. If the model is trained on a specific dataset or domain, it may not perform well on data from a different domain without additional fine-tuning or domain adaptation techniques.\n\nTo mitigate these potential misunderstandings, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the model's performance, assess its limitations, and consider the specific requirements of the application domain. Techniques such as model interpretation methods, bias mitigation strategies, and robustness testing can help address some of these concerns and improve the model's reliability and trustworthiness.", "The Facebook ConvNeXt-base-224-22k model, while powerful, has some known and potential limitations:\n\n1. Limited context: As with most current vision models, ConvNeXt-base-224-22k processes single images independently without understanding broader context or relationships between images.\n\n2. Lack of reasoning: While the model can accurately classify images into predefined categories, it lacks deeper reasoning capabilities to draw insights or understand abstract concepts.\n\n3. Dataset bias: The model's performance may reflect biases present in its training data (the 22k dataset). If certain object types or attributes are over or underrepresented, the model's predictions on real-world data could be skewed.\n\n4. Adversarial vulnerabilities: Carefully crafted input images could potentially fool the model into making incorrect predictions.

In the 2020s, vision Transformers, particularly hierarchical ones such as Swin Transformers, began to overtake ConvNets as the favored choice for generic vision backbones.

We construct different ConvNeXt variants, ConvNeXt-T/S/B/L, to be of similar complexities to Swin-T/S/B/L [45]. ConvNeXt-T/B is the end product of the \"modernizing\" procedure on ResNet-50/200 regime, respectively. In addition, we build a larger ConvNeXt-XL to further test the scalability of ConvNeXt. The variants only differ in the number of channels C, and the number of blocks B in each stage. Following both ResNets and Swin Transformers, the number of channels doubles at each new stage.

The preprocessing steps involve tokenization, which is the process of converting the input text into a sequence of tokens that the model can understand and process.\n\nFor the convnext-base-224-22k model, the tokenization process follows these steps:\n\n1. Text Normalization: The input text is normalized by converting it to lowercase and removing any unnecessary characters or symbols that might not be relevant to the model's understanding of the text.\n\n2. Tokenization: The normalized text is then tokenized using a WordPiece tokenizer. WordPiece is a subword tokenization algorithm that breaks down words into smaller units called subwords or wordpieces. This allows the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words by representing them as a combination of subwords.\n\n   - The WordPiece tokenizer has a predefined vocabulary that is used to tokenize the text. The vocabulary consists of a set of subwords that are learned during the model's training process.\n   - The tokenizer splits the words into subwords by applying a greedy longest-match-first algorithm. It starts from the beginning of each word and tries to find the longest subword that matches an entry in the vocabulary. If a match is found, the subword is added to the list of tokens, and the process continues with the remaining part of the word until the entire word is tokenized.\n   - Special tokens, such as `[CLS]` (classification token) and `[SEP]` (separator token), are added to the sequence of tokens to indicate the start and end of the input text.\n\n3. Token IDs: Each subword token is then converted into a unique integer ID based on its index in the vocabulary. These token IDs serve as the input to the model.\n\n4. Attention Mask: An attention mask is created to indicate which tokens are actual subwords and which are padding tokens (added to ensure a consistent sequence length). The attention mask helps the model focus on the relevant tokens during processing.\n\nThe resulting sequence of token IDs, along with the attention mask, is then passed through the convnext-base-224-22k model for further processing and generating the output.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific details of the tokenization process may vary depending on the implementation and the specific requirements of the convnext-base-224-22k model. The above description provides a general overview of the common steps involved in tokenizing the input data for this model.", "The facebook/convnext-base-224-22k model is a computer vision model that accepts image inputs. As part of the preprocessing pipeline, input images are resized to a consistent size of 224x224 pixels before being passed into the ConvNeXt model architecture.\n\nThe resizing operation ensures that all images have the same dimensions, which is necessary for the convolutional layers in the model to process them correctly. The '224' in the model name refers to this target input size of 224x224 pixels.\n\nDuring resizing, the aspect ratio of the original image is typically maintained by either cropping or padding the image as needed. This helps preserve the important visual content and spatial relationships within the image.\n\nAfter resizing, the pixel values of the image are usually normalized to a standard range, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1], depending on the specific requirements of the model. This normalization step helps improve the stability and convergence of the model during training.\n\nBy applying these preprocessing steps of resizing and normalization, the facebook/convnext-base-224-22k model can efficiently process and analyze images of various sizes and aspect ratios, enabling it to perform tasks such as image classification, object detection, or other computer vision applications."]}

This allows the model to handle out-of-vocabulary words by representing them as a combination of subwords.\n\n   - The WordPiece tokenizer has a predefined vocabulary that is used to tokenize the text. The vocabulary consists of a set of subwords that are learned during the model's training process.\n   - The tokenizer splits the words into subwords by applying a greedy longest-match-first algorithm. It starts from the beginning of each word and tries to find the longest subword that matches an entry in the vocabulary. If a match is found, the subword is added to the list of tokens, and the process continues with the remaining part of the word until the entire word is tokenized.\n   - Special tokens, such as `[CLS]` (classification token) and `[SEP]` (separator token), are added to the sequence of tokens to indicate the start and end of the input text.\n\n3. Token IDs: Each subword token is then converted into a unique integer ID based on its index in the vocabulary. These token IDs serve as the input to the model.\n\n4. Attention Mask: An attention mask is created to indicate which tokens are actual subwords and which are padding tokens (added to ensure a consistent sequence length). The attention mask helps the model focus on the relevant tokens during processing.\n\nThe resulting sequence of token IDs, along with the attention mask, is then passed through the convnext-base-224-22k model for further processing and generating the output.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific details of the tokenization process may vary depending on the implementation and the specific requirements of the convnext-base-224-22k model.

Without the ConvNet inductive biases, a vanilla ViT model faces many challenges in being adopted as a generic vision backbone. The biggest challenge is ViT's global attention design, which has a quadratic complexity with respect to the input size. This might be acceptable for ImageNet classification, but quickly becomes intractable with higher-resolution inputs.\n2. The full dominance of ConvNets in computer vision was not a coincidence: in many application scenarios, a \"sliding window\" strategy is intrinsic to visual processing, particularly when working with high-resolution images. ConvNets have several built-in inductive biases that make them wellsuited to a wide variety of computer vision applications. The most important one is translation equivariance, which is a desirable property for tasks like objection detection. ConvNets are also inherently efficient due to\n3. \"patchify\" layer, which splits an image into a sequence of patches, ViT introduces no image-specific inductive bias and makes minimal changes to the original NLP Transformers. One primary focus of ViT is on the scaling behavior: with the help of larger model and dataset sizes, Transformers can outperform standard ResNets by a significant margin. Those results on image classification tasks are inspiring, but computer vision is not limited to image classification. As discussed previously, solutions to\n4. ConvNeXts on a variety of vision tasks such as ImageNet classification [17], object detection/segmentation on COCO [44], and semantic segmentation on ADE20K [92]. Surprisingly, ConvNeXts, constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy, scalability and robustness across all major benchmarks. Con-vNeXt maintains the efficiency of standard ConvNets, and the fully-convolutional nature for both training and testing makes it extremely simple to\n5. To do this, we start with a standard ResNet (e.g. ResNet-50) trained with an improved procedure. We gradually \"modernize\" the architecture to the construction of a hierarchical vision Transformer (e.g. Swin-T). Our exploration is directed by a key question: How do design decisions in Transformers impact ConvNets' performance? We discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. As a result, we propose a family of pure ConvNets dubbed ConvNeXt.

In the 2020s, research on visual representation learning began to place enormous demands on computing resources. While larger models and datasets improve performance across the board, they also introduce a slew of challenges. ViT, Swin, and ConvNeXt all perform best with their huge model variants.

Following Swin Transformer [45], the ImageNet models' inference throughputs in Table 1 are benchmarked using a V100 GPU, where ConvNeXt is slightly faster in inference than Swin Transformer with a similar number of parameters. We now benchmark them on the more advanced A100 GPUs, which support the TensorFloat32 (TF32) tensor cores. We employ PyTorch [50] version 1.10 to use the latest \"Channel Last\" memory layout [22] for further speedup.\n2. Training on ImageNet-1K. We train ConvNeXts for 300 epochs using AdamW [46] with a learning rate of 4e-3. There is a 20-epoch linear warmup and a cosine decaying schedule afterward. We use a batch size of 4096 and a weight decay of 0.05. For data augmentations, we adopt common schemes including Mixup [90], Cutmix [89], Ran-dAugment [14], and Random Erasing [91]. We regularize the networks with Stochastic Depth [37] and Label Smoothing [69]. Layer Scale [74] of initial value 1e-6 is applied. We use\n3. We present the results in Table 12. Swin Transformers and ConvNeXts both achieve faster inference throughput than V100 GPUs, but ConvNeXts' advantage is now significantly greater, sometimes up to 49% faster. This preliminary study shows promising signals that ConvNeXt, employed with standard ConvNet modules and simple in design, could be practically more efficient models on modern hardwares.\n4. The ImageNet-1K dataset consists of 1000 object classes with 1.2M training images. We report ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy on the validation set. We also conduct pre-training on ImageNet-22K, a larger dataset of 21841 classes (a superset of the 1000 ImageNet-1K classes) with \u223c14M images for pre-training, and then fine-tune the pre-trained model on ImageNet-1K for evaluation. We summarize our training setups below. More details can be found in Appendix A.\n5. Fine-tuning on ImageNet-1K. We fine-tune ImageNet-22K pre-trained models on ImageNet-1K for 30 epochs. We use AdamW, a learning rate of 5e-5, cosine learning rate schedule, layer-wise learning rate decay [6,12], no warmup, a batch size of 512, and weight decay of 1e-8. The default pre-training, fine-tuning, and testing resolution is 224 2 . Additionally, we fine-tune at a larger resolution of 384 2 , for both ImageNet-22K and ImageNet-1K pre-trained models.\n6.

Results for ImageNet-1K at 224 2 resolution are in Table 2 [3]. AP numbers of the ResNet-50 and X101 models are from [45]. We measure FPS on an A100 GPU. FLOPs are calculated with image size (1280, 800).\n7. network's design space expands enormously, obscuring critical components that contribute to the performance difference.

Each stage doubles the number of channels and reduces the spatial resolution by a factor of 2 using a convolutional layer with a stride of 2.\n\n3. ConvNeXt Block: Each ConvNeXt block consists of a depthwise convolution with a kernel size of 7x7, followed by a pointwise convolution (1x1 convolution) to expand the number of channels. The block also includes Layer Normalization and a GELU activation function.\n\n4.
