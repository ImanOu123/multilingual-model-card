Datasets: We used three publicly available datasets: Cityscapes [71], ADE20K [72] and COCO-Stuff [73]. ADE20K is a scene parsing dataset covering 150 fine-grained semantic concepts consisting of 20210 images. Cityscapes is a driving dataset for semantic segmentation consisting of 5000 fineannotated high resolution images with 19 categories. COCO-Stuff covers 172 labels and consists of 164k images: 118k for training, 5k for validation, 20k for test-dev and 20k for the test-challenge.\n2. This section introduces SegFormer, our efficient, robust, and powerful segmentation framework without hand-crafted and computationally demanding modules. As depicted in Figure 2, SegFormer consists of two main modules: (1) a hierarchical Transformer encoder to generate high-resolution coarse features and low-resolution fine features; and (2) a lightweight All-MLP decoder to fuse these multi-level features to produce the final semantic segmentation mask.\n3. During training, we applied data augmentation through random resize with ratio 0.5-2.0, random horizontal flipping, and random cropping to 512 \u00d7 512, 1024\u00d71024, 512 \u00d7 512 for ADE20K, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff, respectively. Following [9] we set crop size to 640 \u00d7 640 on ADE20K for our largest model B5. We trained the models using AdamW optimizer for 160K iterations on ADE20K, Cityscapes, and 80K iterations on COCO-Stuff. Exceptionally, for the ablation studies, we trained the models for 40K iterations. We\n4. used a batch size of 16 for ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, and a batch size of 8 for Cityscapes. The learning rate was set to an initial value of 0.00006 and then used a \"poly\" LR schedule with factor 1.0 by default. For simplicity, we did not adopt widely-used tricks such as OHEM, auxiliary losses or class balance loss. During evaluation, we rescale the short side of the image to training cropping size and keep the aspect ratio for ADE20K and COCO-Stuff. For Cityscapes, we do inference using sliding window test\n5. Given an image of size H \u00d7 W \u00d7 3, we first divide it into patches of size 4 \u00d7 4. Contrary to ViT that uses patches of size 16 \u00d7 16, using smaller patches favors the dense prediction task. We then use these patches as input to the hierarchical Transformer encoder to obtain multi-level features at {1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32} of the original image resolution. We then pass these multi-level features to the All-MLP decoder to predict the segmentation mask at a H 4 \u00d7 W 4 \u00d7 N cls resolution, where N cls is the number\n6. We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation framework which unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer\n7. mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5\u00d7 smaller and 2.2% better than the previous best method. Our best model, SegFormer-B5, achieves 84.0% mIoU on Cityscapes validation set and shows excellent zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes-C.\n8. avoids complex decoders. The proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus combining both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly better performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3%\n9. more efficient. On Cityscapes test set, we follow the common setting [20] and merge the validation images to the train set and report results using Imagenet-1K pre-training and also using Mapillary Vistas [76]. As reported in Table 3 4 shows qualitative results on Cityscapes, where SegFormer provides better details than SETR and smoother predictions than DeeplabV3+.\n10. In Figure 5, we present more qualitative results on Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, compared with SETR and DeepLabV3+.\nCompared to SETR, our SegFormer predicts masks with significantly finer details near object boundaries because our Transformer encoder can capture much higher resolution features than SETR, which preserves more detailed texture information. Compared to DeepLabV3+, SegFormer reduces long-range errors benefit from the larger effective receptive field of Transformer encoder than ConvNet.\n11.

Semantic segmentation involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, effectively segmenting the image into meaningful regions or objects.\n\nTo use this pre-trained model, you can directly input an image of the appropriate size (1024x1024) into the model, and it will output a segmentation mask. The model has already learned to recognize and segment various objects and regions commonly found in urban street scenes, such as roads, buildings, vehicles, pedestrians, and vegetation, based on its training on the Cityscapes dataset.\n\nBy leveraging the pre-existing knowledge and feature extraction capabilities of the Segformer-B1 model, you can obtain semantic segmentation results without the need for additional fine-tuning. This is particularly useful when you have limited labeled data or computational resources for training a model from scratch.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the performance of the model may be optimized for urban street scenes similar to those in the Cityscapes dataset. If your application domain differs significantly from urban environments, fine-tuning the model on a dataset specific to your domain might yield better results. Nonetheless, the pre-trained Segformer-B1 model serves as a strong starting point and can provide reasonable segmentation results out-of-the-box for many urban scene understanding tasks.", "The NVIDIA Segformer-B1 model, fine-tuned on the Cityscapes dataset with an image resolution of 1024x1024, can be used for semantic segmentation tasks without requiring any post-processing steps. Semantic segmentation involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an input image, effectively segmenting the image into meaningful regions or objects.\n\nTo use the model, you simply need to provide an input image of the appropriate size (1024x1024 pixels) and pass it through the model. The Segformer-B1 architecture efficiently processes the image and directly outputs a segmentation mask of the same spatial dimensions as the input. Each pixel in the output mask is assigned a class label corresponding to the semantic category it belongs to, such as road, building, vehicle, or pedestrian.\n\nThe model's output can be directly utilized without the need for additional post-processing steps. The segmentation mask obtained from the model can be visualized or used for various applications, such as autonomous driving, urban planning, or scene understanding, without requiring any further refinement or processing.\n\nThe absence of post-processing makes the inference process more straightforward and computationally efficient, as the model's output can be directly consumed by downstream tasks or visualized for interpretation. This is made possible by the Segformer-B1 model's architecture, which is designed to capture both local and global context information, enabling accurate and detailed segmentation results without the need for additional post-processing techniques.", "The nvidia/segformer-b1-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024 model can be used without plugging into a pipeline by directly utilizing the model's architecture and weights within your own code. Here's a brief explanation of how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Load the pre-trained model:\n   - Download the pre-trained weights of the nvidia/segformer-b1-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024 model.\n   - Create an instance of the model architecture using the appropriate deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow).\n   - Load the pre-trained weights into the model.\n\n2. Preprocess the input data:\n   - Prepare your input data (e.g., images) in the required format and size.\n   - Perform any necessary preprocessing steps, such as resizing, normalization, or data augmentation.\n\n3. Forward pass:\n   - Pass the preprocessed input data through the loaded model to obtain the output predictions.\n   - The model will generate segmentation masks or class probabilities for each pixel in the input image.\n\n4. Postprocess the output:\n   - Apply any necessary postprocessing steps to the model's output, such as thresholding or converting class probabilities to segmentation masks.\n   - Visualize or save the segmentation results as needed.\n\nBy following these steps, you can utilize the nvidia/segformer-b1-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024 model directly in your own code without relying on a pre-built pipeline. This approach provides more flexibility and control over the model's usage, allowing you to integrate it into your specific application or workflow.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that using a pre-built pipeline can often simplify the process and handle many of the common tasks, such as preprocessing and postprocessing, automatically. Pipelines are designed to provide a convenient and standardized way to use models for specific tasks. Nonetheless, if you require more customization or have specific requirements, using the model directly in your code is a viable option.", "The nvidia/segformer-b1-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024 model is a semantic segmentation model fine-tuned on the Cityscapes dataset. It is based on the SegFormer architecture, which combines a hierarchical Transformer encoder with a lightweight all-MLP decode head. The model takes an input image and outputs a segmentation mask, assigning each pixel to one of the predefined classes in the Cityscapes dataset.\n\nHere's a code snippet demonstrating how to use the model for inference using the Hugging Face Transformers library:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import SegformerForSemanticSegmentation, SegformerImageProcessor\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Load the pre-trained model and image processor\nmodel = SegformerForSemanticSegmentation.from_pretrained(\"nvidia/segformer-b1-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024\")\nimage_processor = SegformerImageProcessor.from_pretrained(\"nvidia/segformer-b1-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024\")\n\n# Load and preprocess the input image\nimage = Image.open(\"path/to/your/image.jpg\")\ninputs = image_processor(images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\n# Perform inference\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\n\n# Get the predicted segmentation mask\npredicted_mask = outputs.logits.argmax(dim=1)[0]\n\n# Visualize the segmentation mask\nsegmentation_map = image_processor.decode_segmentation_map(predicted_mask)\nsegmentation_map.show()\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n\n1. We load the pre-trained SegFormer model and the corresponding image processor using the `from_pretrained()` method.\n\n2. We load an input image using PIL (Python Imaging Library) and preprocess it using the `image_processor`. The preprocessed image is converted to a PyTorch tensor.\n\n3. We perform inference by passing the preprocessed image to the model. The `outputs` contain the predicted segmentation logits.\n\n4. We obtain the predicted segmentation mask by taking the `argmax` of the logits along the channel dimension.\n\n5. Finally, we decode the segmentation mask using the `decode_segmentation_map()` method of the image processor and visualize the resulting segmentation map.\n\nNote: Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed (`transformers`, `torch`, `PIL`) before running the code.\n\nThis model can be used for various semantic segmentation tasks on urban street scenes, such as autonomous driving, urban planning, and scene understanding."]}

The learning rate was set to an initial value of 0.00006 and then used a \"poly\" LR schedule with factor 1.0 by default. For simplicity, we did not adopt widely-used tricks such as OHEM, auxiliary losses or class balance loss. During evaluation, we rescale the short side of the image to training cropping size and keep the aspect ratio for ADE20K and COCO-Stuff. For Cityscapes, we do inference using sliding window test\n5. Implementation details: We used the mmsegmentation 1 codebase and train on a server with 8 Tesla V100. We pre-train the encoder on the Imagenet-1K dataset and randomly initialize the decoder.\n6. This section introduces SegFormer, our efficient, robust, and powerful segmentation framework without hand-crafted and computationally demanding modules. As depicted in Figure 2, SegFormer consists of two main modules: (1) a hierarchical Transformer encoder to generate high-resolution coarse features and low-resolution fine features; and (2) a lightweight All-MLP decoder to fuse these multi-level features to produce the final semantic segmentation mask.\n7. Given an image of size H \u00d7 W \u00d7 3, we first divide it into patches of size 4 \u00d7 4. Contrary to ViT that uses patches of size 16 \u00d7 16, using smaller patches favors the dense prediction task. We then use these patches as input to the hierarchical Transformer encoder to obtain multi-level features at {1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32} of the original image resolution. We then pass these multi-level features to the All-MLP decoder to predict the segmentation mask at a H 4 \u00d7 W 4 \u00d7 N cls resolution, where N cls is the number\n8. ./tools/dist_test.sh local_configs/segformer/B1/segformer.b1.512x512.ade.160k.py /path/to/checkpoint_file <GPU_NUM>\n9.

We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation framework which unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer\n11. more efficient. On Cityscapes test set, we follow the common setting [20] and merge the validation images to the train set and report results using Imagenet-1K pre-training and also using Mapillary Vistas [76]. As reported in Table 3 4 shows qualitative results on Cityscapes, where SegFormer provides better details than SETR and smoother predictions than DeeplabV3+.\n```\n\nQuestion:\n```\nExplain how the model nvidia/segformer-b1-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024 can be used without fine-tuning, post-processing, or plugging into a pipeline.

When integrated into a larger ecosystem or application, this model can enable a wide range of functionalities and use cases.\n\nOne key application of this model is in autonomous driving systems. By accurately segmenting and understanding the various elements of a cityscape, such as roads, sidewalks, vehicles, and pedestrians, the Segformer-B1 model can provide critical information to the decision-making processes of self-driving cars. This can help ensure safer navigation and improved situational awareness in complex urban environments.\n\nMoreover, the model's output can be combined with other sensors and data sources within a larger ecosystem. For instance, the segmented images can be fused with lidar point clouds, GPS data, and real-time traffic information to create a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle's surroundings. This information can then be used by higher-level planning and control systems to make informed decisions and optimize the vehicle's trajectory.\n\nBeyond autonomous driving, the Segformer-B1 model can also find applications in urban planning and infrastructure management. By analyzing large volumes of cityscape imagery, the model can help identify and monitor changes in the urban landscape, such as the condition of roads, the growth of vegetation, or the development of new structures. This information can be invaluable for city authorities in planning maintenance activities, optimizing resource allocation, and making data-driven decisions.\n\nFurthermore, the model's segmentation capabilities can be leveraged in augmented reality (AR) applications. By understanding the layout and content of a cityscape image, the model can enable realistic and contextually aware placement of virtual objects within the real-world scene. This can enhance user experiences in gaming, navigation, and tourism applications.\n\nIn summary, the NVIDIA Segformer-B1 model, fine-tuned on the Cityscapes dataset, is a versatile tool that can be integrated into various ecosystems and applications. Its ability to accurately segment and understand urban environments makes it particularly valuable in autonomous driving, urban planning, and augmented reality domains, among others.

For simplicity, we did not adopt widely-used tricks such as OHEM, auxiliary losses or class balance loss.

Limited dataset scope: The model is fine-tuned specifically on the Cityscapes dataset, which consists of urban street scenes from various European cities. While this dataset is diverse and well-annotated, it may not cover all possible scenarios and environments. The model's performance may degrade when applied to scenes that significantly differ from the training data, such as rural areas, different weather conditions, or cities with distinct architectural styles.\n\n2. Model size and computational requirements: The Segformer-B1 model, although relatively lightweight compared to some other semantic segmentation models, still requires significant computational resources for inference. This may limit its applicability in resource-constrained environments or real-time applications on edge devices with limited processing power and memory.\n\n3. Potential biases and errors: Like any machine learning model, the Segformer-B1 may exhibit biases or make errors based on the training data and the model's architecture. It may struggle with rare or ambiguous objects, complex scenes, or situations not well-represented in the Cityscapes dataset. Thorough evaluation and error analysis are necessary to identify and mitigate potential biases and limitations.\n\n4. Generalization to new object categories: The model is trained to segment and classify objects based on the categories present in the Cityscapes dataset. If the model is applied to scenes containing object categories not present in the training data, it may not be able to accurately segment and classify those objects without additional fine-tuning or adaptation.\n\n5. Robustness to adversarial attacks: As with many deep learning models, the Segformer-B1 may be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where carefully crafted perturbations to the input images can cause the model to make incorrect predictions. Ensuring the model's robustness against such attacks is an important consideration, especially in safety-critical applications.\n\nAddressing these issues may require techniques such as domain adaptation, model compression, data augmentation, and adversarial training, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.", "When considering the use of the NVIDIA Segformer-B1 model fine-tuned on the Cityscapes dataset (1024x1024 resolution), there are a few foreseeable issues and recommendations to keep in mind:\n\n1.

This may limit the model's performance when applied to drastically different environments or scenarios, such as rural areas or cities with significantly different architecture and road layouts.\n\n2. Resolution constraints: The model is trained on images with a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels. If the input images have a considerably different resolution or aspect ratio, the model's performance may be impacted. It is recommended to preprocess the input images to match the expected resolution and aspect ratio.\n\n3. Computational requirements: The Segformer-B1 model is a relatively large deep learning model, which may require significant computational resources, particularly for real-time applications. It is important to consider the available hardware and optimize the model's deployment accordingly.\n\n4. Domain shift: If the model is applied to images that differ significantly from the Cityscapes dataset in terms of lighting conditions, weather, or object appearance, the model's performance may degrade. It is recommended to assess the model's performance on a representative sample of the target domain and consider domain adaptation techniques if necessary.\n\n5. Maintenance and updates: As with any machine learning model, it is essential to monitor the model's performance over time and consider updating or retraining the model as new data becomes available or if the target domain evolves. Regular maintenance and evaluation will help ensure the model's continued effectiveness.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, it is recommended to thoroughly evaluate the model's performance on a diverse set of test cases representative of the intended application domain.

Potential biases and errors: Like any machine learning model, the Segformer-B1 may exhibit biases or make errors based on the training data and the model's architecture. It may struggle with rare or ambiguous objects, complex scenes, or situations not well-represented in the Cityscapes dataset. Thorough evaluation and error analysis are necessary to identify and mitigate potential biases and limitations.\n\n4.

The tokenization process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Resizing: The input images are resized to a fixed resolution of 1024x1024 pixels to ensure consistent input dimensions for the model. This resizing operation maintains the aspect ratio of the original images by applying appropriate padding or cropping techniques.\n\n2. Patch Splitting: The resized image is then divided into non-overlapping patches of a fixed size, typically 16x16 or 32x32 pixels. These patches serve as the basic units for further processing and feature extraction.\n\n3. Patch Embedding: Each image patch is linearly projected into a lower-dimensional embedding space using a learned embedding matrix. This step converts the raw pixel values of the patches into dense vector representations that capture the local spatial information.\n\n4. Positional Encoding: To preserve the spatial relationships between the patches, positional encoding is added to the patch embeddings. The positional encoding can be learned or predefined, such as using sinusoidal functions or learnable positional embeddings.\n\n5. Patch Flattening: The embedded patches are then flattened into a 1D sequence of tokens. Each token represents a patch and its corresponding position in the original image.\n\n6. Token Encoding: The flattened sequence of tokens is passed through a series of transformer encoder layers. These layers apply self-attention mechanisms to capture the dependencies and relationships between the tokens, allowing the model to learn contextual information and generate rich feature representations.\n\n7. Decoding: The encoded tokens are then passed through a series of transformer decoder layers, which generate the final segmentation map. The decoder layers utilize cross-attention mechanisms to attend to the relevant encoded tokens and generate pixel-wise predictions.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific details of the tokenization process may vary depending on the implementation and the chosen hyperparameters of the Segformer-B1 model. However, the general pipeline involves resizing the input images, splitting them into patches, embedding the patches, adding positional information, and encoding the tokens using transformer layers for segmentation tasks.", "The nvidia/segformer-b1-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024 model is a semantic segmentation model fine-tuned on the Cityscapes dataset. It is based on the SegFormer architecture, which is designed to handle high-resolution images efficiently.\n\nRegarding the preprocessing of the data for this model, the input images are resized to a fixed resolution of 1024x1024 pixels. This resizing step ensures that all images have a consistent size before being fed into the model. The resizing is typically done using bilinear interpolation to maintain the spatial information and preserve the aspect ratio of the original images.\n\nIn addition to resizing, the pixel values of the input images are normalized. The normalization step involves subtracting the mean pixel values and dividing by the standard deviation. This normalization helps to center the pixel values around zero and scale them to a consistent range, which can improve the model's training stability and convergence.\n\nFor the Cityscapes dataset specifically, the model expects the input images to be in the RGB color space. If the original images are in a different color space, they need to be converted to RGB before being processed by the model.\n\nIt's important to note that the preprocessing steps applied to the input images should be consistent between training and inference. This means that any resizing, normalization, or color space conversions applied during training should also be applied when using the model for prediction on new data.\n\nOverall, the preprocessing for the nvidia/segformer-b1-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024 model involves resizing the input images to a fixed resolution of 1024x1024 pixels, normalizing the pixel values, and ensuring the images are in the RGB color space.

The resizing is typically done using bilinear interpolation to maintain the spatial information and preserve the aspect ratio of the original images.\n\nIn addition to resizing, the pixel values of the input images are normalized. The normalization step involves subtracting the mean pixel values and dividing by the standard deviation. This normalization helps to center the pixel values around zero and scale them to a consistent range, which can improve the model's training stability and convergence.\n\nFor the Cityscapes dataset specifically, the model expects the input images to be in the RGB color space. If the original images are in a different color space, they need to be converted to RGB before being processed by the model.\n\nIt's important to note that the preprocessing steps applied to the input images should be consistent between training and inference. This means that any resizing, normalization, or color space conversions applied during training should also be applied when using the model for prediction on new data.\n\nOverall, the preprocessing for the nvidia/segformer-b1-finetuned-cityscapes-1024-1024 model involves resizing the input images to a fixed resolution of 1024x1024 pixels, normalizing the pixel values, and ensuring the images are in the RGB color space.

This section introduces SegFormer, our efficient, robust, and powerful segmentation framework without hand-crafted and computationally demanding modules. As depicted in Figure 2, SegFormer consists of two main modules: (1) a hierarchical Transformer encoder to generate high-resolution coarse features and low-resolution fine features; and (2) a lightweight All-MLP decoder to fuse these multi-level features to produce the final semantic segmentation mask.\n3.

Camera perspective: The dataset features images captured from a car's perspective. The model may not perform as well on images taken from significantly different viewpoints, such as aerial or sidewalk perspectives.\n\n4. Object scale: The model is trained on images with a resolution of 1024x1024, which allows it to capture fine details. However, it may struggle with very small or distant objects that occupy only a few pixels in the image.\n\n5. Geographic and architectural differences: The Cityscapes dataset was collected in German cities.

Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU): This metric measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation mask and the ground truth mask, averaged across all classes. It is calculated by dividing the intersection of the predicted and ground truth masks by their union, and then taking the mean across all classes.\n\n2.

Depending on the application, one type of error may be more tolerable than the other. For example, in autonomous driving, false negatives for pedestrian detection could be more dangerous than false positives.\n\n2. Accuracy vs. computational efficiency: The Segformer-B1 model strikes a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. While larger models like Segformer-B5 may achieve higher accuracy, they also require more computational resources and longer inference times. The B1 model provides a good trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy while being more lightweight and faster to run.\n\n3. Confusion between similar classes: The model may struggle to differentiate between visually similar classes, such as cars and trucks or pedestrians and cyclists. This can lead to misclassifications and lower performance for these specific classes. However, the overall accuracy of the model remains high, and the impact of these errors may be less significant depending on the application.\n\n4. Performance on rare classes: The Cityscapes dataset has an imbalanced distribution of classes, with some classes being more prevalent than others. The model may have lower performance on rare classes due to the limited training data available. This can be mitigated through techniques like class weighting or data augmentation, but it remains a trade-off to consider when evaluating the model's performance.\n\nUltimately, the choice of model and the tolerance for different types of errors will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the application at hand.

For evaluating semantic segmentation models, the commonly used metrics include:\n\n1. Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU): This metric measures the overlap between the predicted segmentation mask and the ground truth mask, averaged across all classes. It is calculated by dividing the intersection of the predicted and ground truth masks by their union, and then taking the mean across all classes.\n\n2. Pixel Accuracy: This metric calculates the percentage of correctly classified pixels across all classes. It is computed by dividing the number of correctly classified pixels by the total number of pixels in the image.\n\n3. Class-wise Intersection over Union (IoU): Similar to mIoU, this metric calculates the IoU for each individual class separately, providing a more detailed evaluation of the model's performance on specific classes.\n\n4. Frequency Weighted Intersection over Union (FWIoU): This metric is similar to mIoU but assigns higher weights to classes with more pixels, giving more importance to the accurate segmentation of larger objects.\n\nThese metrics are commonly used to assess the performance of semantic segmentation models like the one mentioned in the question.

False positives vs. false negatives: False positives occur when the model incorrectly identifies a pixel as belonging to a specific class, while false negatives happen when the model fails to identify a pixel that should be classified as a particular class. Depending on the application, one type of error may be more tolerable than the other.

We now compare our results with existing approaches on the ADE20K [72], Cityscapes [71] and COCO-Stuff [73] datasets. ADE20K and Cityscapes: Table 2 summarizes our results including parameters, FLOPS, latency, and accuracy for ADE20K and Cityscapes.

In terms of performance, we can observe that, overall, increasing the size of the encoder yields consistent improvements on all the datasets.

We first analyze the effect of increasing the size of the encoder on the performance and model efficiency. Figure 1 shows the performance vs. model efficiency for ADE20K as a function of the encoder size and, Table 1a summarizes the results for the three datasets. The first thing to observe here is the size of the decoder compared to the encoder. As shown, for the lightweight model, the decoder has only 0.4M parameters. For MiT-B5 encoder, the decoder only takes up to 4% of\n5. used a batch size of 16 for ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, and a batch size of 8 for Cityscapes. The learning rate was set to an initial value of 0.00006 and then used a \"poly\" LR schedule with factor 1.0 by default. For simplicity, we did not adopt widely-used tricks such as OHEM, auxiliary losses or class balance loss. During evaluation, we rescale the short side of the image to training cropping size and keep the aspect ratio for ADE20K and COCO-Stuff. For Cityscapes, we do inference using sliding window test\n6. Model robustness is important for many safety-critical tasks such as autonomous driving [77]. In this experiment, we evaluate the robustness of SegFormer to common corruptions and perturbations. To this end, we follow [77] and generate Cityscapes-C, which expands the Cityscapes validation set with 16 types of algorithmically generated corruptions from noise, blur, weather and digital categories. We compare our method to variants of DeeplabV3+ and other methods as reported in [77]. The results for this\n7. In Figure 5, we present more qualitative results on Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, compared with SETR and DeepLabV3+.\nCompared to SETR, our SegFormer predicts masks with significantly finer details near object boundaries because our Transformer encoder can capture much higher resolution features than SETR, which preserves more detailed texture information. Compared to DeepLabV3+, SegFormer reduces long-range errors benefit from the larger effective receptive field of Transformer encoder than ConvNet.\n8. As shown, on ADE20K, SegFormer-B0 yields 37.4% mIoU using only 3.8M parameters and 8.4G FLOPs, outperforming all other real-time counterparts in terms of parameters, flops, and latency. For instance, compared to DeeplabV3+ (MobileNetV2), SegFormer-B0 is 7.4 FPS, which is faster and keeps 3.4% better mIoU. Moreover, SegFormer-B5 outperforms all other approaches, including the previous best SETR, and establishes a new state-of-the-art of 51.8%, which is 1.6% mIoU better than SETR while being significantly\n9.

The SegFormer architecture consists of the following main components:\n\n1. Hierarchical Transformer Encoder: The encoder is built using a hierarchical structure of transformer blocks. It takes the input image and applies a series of transformer layers to extract multi-scale features at different resolutions. The encoder captures both local and global context information.\n\n2. Efficient Self-Attention: SegFormer employs an efficient self-attention mechanism called \"Mix-FFN\" (Mix Feed-Forward Network). It reduces the computational complexity of self-attention by mixing local and global information in the feed-forward network.\n\n3. Overlapped Patch Merging: To downsample the feature maps and reduce spatial resolution, SegFormer uses an overlapped patch merging strategy. It merges neighboring patches with overlapping regions to preserve more spatial information compared to non-overlapping patch merging.\n\n4. Decoder: The decoder takes the multi-scale features from the encoder and gradually upsamples them to the original image resolution. It combines the features from different scales using a series of convolutional layers and upsampling operations.\n\n5.
