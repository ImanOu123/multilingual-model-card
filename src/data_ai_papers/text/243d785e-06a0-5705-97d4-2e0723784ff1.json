Unfortunately, the non-projective parsing problem is known to be NP-hard for all but the simplest models (McDonald and Satta, 2007). There has been a long history in combinatorial optimization of methods that exploit structure in complex problems, using methods such as dual decomposition or Lagrangian relaxation (Lemar\u00e9chal, 2001). Thus far, however, these methods are not widely used in NLP.\nThis paper introduces algorithms for nonprojective parsing based on dual decomposition. We focus on parsing algorithms for non-projective head automata, a generalization of the head-automata models of Eisner (2000) and Alshawi (1996) to nonprojective structures. These models include nonprojective dependency parsing models with higherorder (e.g., sibling and/or grandparent) dependency relations as a special case. Although decoding of full parse structures with non-projective head automata is intractable, we leverage the observation that key components of the decoding can be efficiently computed using combinatorial algorithms. In particular, 1. Decoding for individual head-words can be accomplished using dynamic programming.\n2. Decoding for arc-factored models can be accomplished using directed minimum-weight spanning tree (MST) algorithms.\nThe resulting parsing algorithms have the following properties:\n\u2022 They are efficient and easy to implement, relying on standard dynamic programming and MST algorithms.\n\u2022 They provably solve a linear programming (LP) relaxation of the original decoding problem.\n\u2022 Empirically the algorithms very often give an exact solution to the decoding problem, in which case they also provide a certificate of optimality.\nIn this paper we first give the definition for nonprojective head automata, and describe the parsing algorithm. The algorithm can be viewed as an instance of Lagrangian relaxation; we describe this connection, and give convergence guarantees for the method. We describe a generalization to models that include grandparent dependencies. We then introduce a perceptron-driven training algorithm that makes use of point 1 above.\nWe describe experiments on non-projective parsing for a number of languages, and in particular compare the dual decomposition algorithm to approaches based on general-purpose linear programming (LP) or integer linear programming (ILP) solvers (Martins et al., 2009). The accuracy of our models is higher than previous work on a broad range of datasets. The method gives exact solutions to the decoding problem, together with a certificate of optimality, on over 98% of test examples for many of the test languages, with parsing times ranging between 0.021 seconds/sentence for the most simple languages/models, to 0.295 seconds/sentence for the most complex settings. The method compares favorably to previous work using LP/ILP formulations, both in terms of efficiency, and also in terms of the percentage of exact solutions returned.\nWhile the focus of the current paper is on nonprojective dependency parsing, the approach opens up new ways of thinking about parsing algorithms for lexicalized formalisms such as TAG (Joshi and Schabes, 1997), CCG (Steedman, 2000), and projective head automata.  2006) make use of an approximate (hill-climbing) algorithm for parsing with more complex models. McDonald and Pereira (2006) and McDonald and Satta (2007) describe complexity results for nonprojective parsing, showing that parsing for a variety of models is NP-hard. Riedel and Clarke (2006) describe ILP methods for the problem; Martins et al. (2009) recently introduced alternative LP and ILP formulations. Our algorithm differs in that we do not use general-purpose LP or ILP solvers, instead using an MST solver in combination with dynamic programming; thus we leverage the underlying structure of the problem, thereby deriving more efficient decoding algorithms.", "publication_ref": ["b16", "b12", "b5", "b0", "b14", "b7", "b27", "b15", "b16", "b22", "b14"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Both dual decomposition and Lagrangian relaxation have a long history in combinatorial optimization. Our work was originally inspired by recent work on dual decomposition for inference in graphical models (Wainwright et al., 2005;Komodakis et al., 2007). However, the non-projective parsing problem has a very different structure from these models, and the decomposition we use is very different in nature from those used in graphical models. Other work has made extensive use of decomposition approaches for efficiently solving LP relaxations for graphical models (e.g., Sontag et al. (2008)). Methods that incorporate combinatorial solvers within loopy belief propagation (LBP) (Duchi et al., 2007;Smith and Eisner, 2008) are also closely related to our approach. Unlike LBP, our method has strong theoretical guarantees, such as guaranteed convergence and the possibility of a certificate of optimality.\nFinally, in other recent work, Rush et al. (2010) describe dual decomposition approaches for other NLP problems.", "publication_ref": ["b30", "b8", "b26", "b4", "b24", "b23"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Sibling Models", "text": "This section describes a particular class of models, sibling models; the next section describes a dualdecomposition algorithm for decoding these models.\nConsider the dependency parsing problem for a sentence with n words. We define the index set for dependency parsing to be I = {(i, j) : i \u2208 {0 . . . n}, j \u2208 {1 . . . n}, i = j}. A dependency parse is a vector y = {y(i, j) : (i, j) \u2208 I}, where y(i, j) = 1 if a dependency with head word i and modifier j is in the parse, 0 otherwise. We use i = 0 for the root symbol. We define Y to be the set of all well-formed non-projective dependency parses (i.e., the set of directed spanning trees rooted at node 0). Given a function f : Y \u2192 R that assigns scores to parse trees, the optimal parse is\ny * = argmax y\u2208Y f (y)(1)\nA particularly simple definition of f (y) is f (y) =\n(i,j)\u2208I y(i, j)\u03b8(i, j) where \u03b8(i, j) is the score for dependency (i, j). Models with this form are often referred to as arc-factored models. In this case the optimal parse tree y * can be found efficiently using MST algorithms (McDonald et al., 2005).\nThis paper describes algorithms that compute y * for more complex definitions of f (y); in this section, we focus on algorithms for models that capture interactions between sibling dependencies. To this end, we will find it convenient to define the following notation. Given a vector y, define y |i = {y(i, j) : j = 1 . . . n, j = i} Hence y |i specifies the set of modifiers to word i; note that the vectors y |i for i = 0 . . . n form a partition of the full set of variables.\nWe then assume that f (y) takes the form\nf (y) = n i=0 f i (y |i )(2)\nThus f (y) decomposes into a sum of terms, where each f i considers modifiers to the i'th word alone.\nIn the general case, finding y * = argmax y\u2208Y f (y) under this definition of f (y) is an NP-hard problem. However for certain definitions of f i , it is possible to efficiently compute argmax y |i \u2208Z i f i (y |i ) for any value of i, typically using dynamic programming. (Here we use Z i to refer to the set of all possible values for y |i : specifically, Z 0 = {0, 1} n and for i = 0, Z i = {0, 1} n\u22121 .) In these cases we can efficiently compute\nz * = argmax z\u2208Z f (z) = argmax z\u2208Z i f i (z |i )(3)\nwhere Z = {z : z |i \u2208 Z i for i = 0 . . . n} by simply computing z * |i = argmax z |i \u2208Z i f i (z |i ) for i = 0 . . . n. Eq. 3 can be considered to be an approximation to Eq. 1, where we have replaced Y with Z. We will make direct use of this approximation in the dual decomposition parsing algorithm. Note that Y \u2286 Z, and in all but trivial cases, Y is a strict subset of Z. For example, a structure z \u2208 Z could have z(i, j) = z(j, i) = 1 for some (i, j); it could contain longer cycles; or it could contain words that do not modify exactly one head. Nevertheless, with suitably powerful functions f i -for example functions based on discriminative models-z * may be a good approximation to y * . Later we will see that dual decomposition can effectively use MST inference to rule out ill-formed structures.\nWe now give the main assumption underlying sibling models: Assumption 1 (Sibling Decompositions) A model f (y) satisfies the sibling-decomposition assumption if: 1) f (y) = n i=0 f i (y |i ) for some set of functions f 0 . . . f n . 2) For any i \u2208 {0 . . . n}, for any value of the variables u(i, j) \u2208 R for j = 1 . . . n, it is possible to compute\nargmax y |i \u2208Z i \uf8eb \uf8ed f i (y |i ) \u2212 j u(i, j)y(i, j) \uf8f6 \uf8f8 in polynomial time.\nThe second condition includes additional terms involving u(i, j) variables that modify the scores of individual dependencies. These terms are benign for most definitions of f i , in that they do not alter decoding complexity. They will be of direct use in the dual decomposition parsing algorithm.\nExample 1: Bigram Sibling Models. Recall that y |i is a binary vector specifying which words are modifiers to the head-word i. Define l 1 . . . l p to be the sequence of left modifiers to word i under y |i , and r 1 . . . r q to be the set of right modifiers (e.g., consider the case where n = 5, i = 3, and we have y(3, 1) = y(3, 5) = 0, and y(3, 2) = y(3, 4) = 1: in this case p = 1, l 1 = 2, and q = 1, r 1 = 4). In bigram sibling models, we have\nf i (y |i ) = p+1 k=1 g L (i, l k\u22121 , l k ) + q+1 k=1 g R (i, r k\u22121 , r k )\nwhere l 0 = r 0 = START is the initial state, and l p+1 = r q+1 = END is the end state. The functions g L and g R assign scores to bigram dependencies to the left and right of the head. Under this model calculating argmax y |i \u2208Z i f i (y |i ) \u2212 j u(i, j)y(i, j) takes O(n 2 ) time using dynamic programming, hence the model satisfies Assumption 1.\nExample 2: Head Automata Head-automata models constitute a second important model type that satisfy the sibling-decomposition assumption (bigram sibling models are a special case of head automata). These models make use of functions g R (i, s, s , r) where s \u2208 S, s \u2208 S are variables in a set of possible states S, and r is an index of a word in the sentence such that i < r \u2264 n. The function g R returns a cost for taking word r as the next dependency, and transitioning from state s to s . A similar function g L is defined for left modifiers. We define\nf i (y |i , s 0 . . . s q , t 0 . . . t p ) = q k=1 g R (i, s k\u22121 , s k , r k ) + p k=1 g L (i, t k\u22121 , t k , l l )\nto be the joint score for dependencies y |i , and left and right state sequences s 0 . . . s q and t 0 . . . t p . We specify that s 0 = t 0 = START and s q = t p = END. In this case we define\nf i (y |i ) = max s 0 ...sq,t 0 ...tp f i (y |i , s 0 . . . s q , t 0 . . . t p )\nand it follows that argmax y |i \u2208Z i f i (y |i ) can be computed in O(n|S| 2 ) time using a variant of the Viterbi algorithm, hence the model satisfies the siblingdecomposition assumption.", "publication_ref": ["b17"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "The Parsing Algorithm", "text": "We now describe the dual decomposition parsing algorithm for models that satisfy Assumption 1.

Thus, it is these constraints that complicate the optimization. Our approach gets around this difficulty by introducing new variables, u(i, j), that serve to enforce agreement between the y(i, j) and z(i, j) variables. In the next section we will show that these u(i, j) variables are actually Lagrange multipliers for the z(i, j) = y(i, j) constraints.\nOur parsing algorithm is shown in Figure 1. At each iteration k, the algorithm finds y (k) \u2208 Y using an MST algorithm, and z (k) \u2208 Z through separate decoding of the (n + 1) sibling models. The u (k) variables are updated if y (k) (i, j) = z (k) (i, j) for some (i, j); these updates modify the objective functions for the two decoding steps, and intuitively encourage the y (k) and z (k) variables to be equal.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Lagrangian Relaxation", "text": "Recall that the main difficulty in solving Eq. 4 was the z = y constraints. We deal with these constraints using Lagrangian relaxation (Lemar\u00e9chal, 2001). We first introduce Lagrange multipliers u = {u(i, j) : (i, j) \u2208 I}, and define the Lagrangian\nL(u, y, z) = (6) f (z) + h(y) + (i,j)\u2208I u(i, j) y(i, j) \u2212 z(i, j)\nIf L * is the optimal value of Eq. 4 subject to the constraints in Eq. 5, then for any value of u,\nL * = max z\u2208Z,y\u2208Y,y=z L(u, y, z)(7)\nThis follows because if y = z, the right term in Eq. 6 is zero for any value of u. The dual objective L(u) is obtained by omitting the y = z constraint:\nL(u) = max z\u2208Z,y\u2208Y L(u, y, z) = max z\u2208Z f (z) \u2212 i,j u(i, j)z(i, j) + max y\u2208Y h(y) + i,j\nu(i, j)y(i, j) .\nSince L(u) maximizes over a larger space (y may not equal z), we have that L * \u2264 L(u) (compare this to Eq. 7). The dual problem, which our algorithm optimizes, is to obtain the tightest such upper bound, (Dual problem) min\nu\u2208R |I| L(u).(8)\nThe dual objective L(u) is convex, but not differentiable. However, we can use a subgradient method to derive an algorithm that is similar to gradient descent, and which minimizes L(u). A subgradient of a convex function\nL(u) at u is a vector d u such that for all v \u2208 R |I| , L(v) \u2265 L(u) + d u \u2022 (v \u2212 u).

It is easily verified that the algorithm in Figure 1 uses precisely these updates.", "publication_ref": ["b12"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Formal Guarantees", "text": "With an appropriate choice of the step sizes \u03b1 k , the subgradient method can be shown to solve the dual problem, i.e.\nlim k\u2192\u221e L(u (k) ) = min u L(u).\nSee Korte and Vygen (2008), page 120, for details.

(9)\nHowever, we do not necessarily have strong duality-i.e., equality in the above equationbecause the sets Z and Y are discrete sets. That said, for some functions h(y) and f (z) strong duality does hold, as stated in the following:\nTheorem 1 If for some k \u2208 {1 . . . K} in the algorithm in Figure 1, y (k) (i, j) = z (k) (i, j) for all (i, j) \u2208 I, then (y (k) , z (k) ) is a solution to the maximization problem in Eq. 4.", "publication_ref": ["b10"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Proof.", "text": "We have that f (z (k) ) + h(y (k) ) = L(u (k) , z (k) , y (k) ) = L(u (k) ), where the last equality is because y (k) , z (k) are defined as the respective argmax's. Thus, the inequality in Eq. 9 is tight, and (y (k) , z (k) ) and u (k) are primal and dual optimal.\nAlthough the algorithm is not guaranteed to satisfy y (k) = z (k) for some k, by Theorem 1 if it does reach such a state, then we have the guarantee of an exact solution to Eq. 4, with the dual solution u providing a certificate of optimality. We show in the experiments that this occurs very frequently, in spite of the parsing problem being NP-hard.\nIt can be shown that Eq. 8 is the dual of an LP relaxation of the original problem. When the conditions of Theorem 1 are satisfied, it means that the LP relaxation is tight for this instance. For brevity we omit the details, except to note that when the LP relaxation is not tight, the optimal primal solution to the LP relaxation could be recovered by averaging methods (Nedi\u0107 and Ozdaglar, 2009).", "publication_ref": ["b19"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Grandparent Dependency Models", "text": "In this section we extend the approach to consider grandparent relations. In grandparent models each parse tree y is represented as a vector y = {y(i, j) : (i, j) \u2208 I} \u222a {y \u2191 (i, j) : (i, j) \u2208 I} where we have added a second set of duplicate variables, y \u2191 (i, j) for all (i, j) \u2208 I. The set of all valid parse trees is then defined as Y = {y : y(i, j) variables form a directed tree,\ny \u2191 (i, j) = y(i, j) for all (i, j) \u2208 I}\nWe again partition the variables into n + 1 subsets, y |0 . . . y |n , by (re)defining\ny |i = {y(i, j) : j = 1 . . . n, j = i} \u222a{y \u2191 (k, i) : k = 0 . . . n, k = i}\nSo as before y |i contains variables y(i, j) which indicate which words modify the i'th word. In addition, y |i includes y \u2191 (k, i) variables that indicate the word that word i itself modifies.\nThe set of all possible values of y |i is now\nZ i = {y |i : y(i, j) \u2208 {0, 1} for j = 1 . . . n, j = i; y \u2191 (k, i) \u2208 {0, 1} for k = 0 . . . n, k = i; k y \u2191 (k, i) = 1}\nHence the y(i, j) variables can take any values, but only one of the y \u2191 (k, i) variables can be equal to 1 (as only one word can be a parent of word i). As before, we define Z = {y : y |i \u2208 Z i for i = 0 . . . n}.\nWe introduce the following assumption: Assumption 2 (GS Decompositions) A model f (y) satisfies the grandparent/siblingdecomposition (GSD) assumption if: 1) f (z) = n i=0 f i (z |i ) for some set of functions f 0 . . . f n . 2) For any i \u2208 {0 . . . n}, for any value of the variables u(i, j) \u2208 R for j = 1 . . . n, and v(k, i) \u2208 R for k = 0 . . . n, it is possible to compute argmax\nz |i \u2208Z i (f i (z |i )\u2212 j u(i, j)z(i, j)\u2212 k v(k, i)z \u2191 (k, i)) in polynomial time.\nAgain, it follows that we can approximate\ny * = argmax y\u2208Y n i=0 f i (y |i ) by z * = argmax z\u2208Z n i=0 f i (z |i ), by defining z * |i = argmax z |i \u2208Z i f i (z |i ) for i = 0 . . . n.\nThe resulting vector z * may be deficient in two respects. First, the variables z * (i, j) may not form a wellformed directed spanning tree. Second, we may have z * \u2191 (i, j) = z * (i, j) for some values of (i, j).\nExample 3: Grandparent/Sibling Models An important class of models that satisfy Assumption 2 are defined as follows. Again, for a vector y |i define l 1 . . . l p to be the sequence of left modifiers to word i under y |i , and r 1 . . . r q to be the set of right modifiers. Define k * to the value for k such that y \u2191 (k, i) = 1. Then the model is defined as follows:\nf i (y |i ) = p+1 j=1 g L (i, k * , l j\u22121 , l j )+ q+1 j=1 g R (i, k * , r j\u22121 , r j )\nThis is very similar to the bigram-sibling model, but with the modification that the g L and g R functions depend in addition on the value for k * . This allows these functions to model grandparent dependencies such as (k * , i, l j ) and sibling dependencies such as (i, l j\u22121 , l j ). Finding z * |i under the definition can be accomplished in O(n 3 ) time, by decoding the model using dynamic programming separately for each of the O(n) possible values of k * , and picking the value for k * that gives the maximum value under these decodings.\nA dual-decomposition algorithm for models that satisfy the GSD assumption is shown in Figure 2. The algorithm can be justified as an instance of Lagrangian relaxation applied to the problem\nargmax z\u2208Z,y\u2208Y f (z) + h(y)(10)\nwith constraints z(i, j) = y(i, j) for all (i, j) \u2208 I (11) z \u2191 (i, j) = y(i, j) for all (i, j) \u2208 I (12)\nThe algorithm employs two sets of Lagrange multipliers, u(i, j) and v(i, j), corresponding to constraints in Eqs. 11 and 12.

In the grandparent models in our experiments, we use a similar definition with feature vectors \u03c6 L (x, i, k * , l k\u22121 , l k ) and \u03c6 R (x, i, k * , r k\u22121 , r k ), where k * is the parent for word i under y |i .\nWe train the model using the averaged perceptron for structured problems (Collins, 2002). Given the i'th example in the training set, (x (i) , y (i) ), the perceptron updates are as follows:\n\u2022 z * = argmax y\u2208Z w \u2022 \u03c6(x (i) , y) \u2022 If z * = y (i) , w = w +\u03c6(x (i) , y (i) )\u2212\u03c6(x (i) , z * )\nThe first step involves inference over the set Z, rather than Y as would be standard in the perceptron. Thus, decoding during training can be achieved by dynamic programming over head automata alone, which is very efficient.\nOur training approach is closely related to local training methods (Punyakanok et al., 2005). We have found this method to be effective, very likely because Z is a superset of Y. Our training algorithm is also related to recent work on training using outer bounds (see, e.g., (Taskar et al., 2003;Finley and Joachims, 2008;Kulesza and Pereira, 2008;Martins et al., 2009)). Note, however, that the LP relaxation optimized by dual decomposition is significantly tighter than Z. Thus, an alternative approach would be to use the dual decomposition algorithm for inference during training.", "publication_ref": ["b3", "b21", "b29", "b6", "b11", "b14"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "We report results on a number of data sets.

There are a number of possible areas for future work. As described in section 7.7, the algorithms can be easily modified to consider projective structures by replacing Y with the set of projective trees, and then using first-order dependency parsing algorithms in place of MST decoding. This method could be used to derive parsing algorithms that include higher-order features, as an alternative to specialized dynamic programming algorithms. Eisner (2000) describes extensions of head automata to include word senses; we have not discussed this issue in the current paper, but it is simple to develop dual decomposition algorithms for this case, using similar methods to those used for the grandparent models. The general approach should be applicable to other lexicalized syntactic formalisms, and potentially also to decoding in syntax-driven translation. In addition, our dual decomposition approach is well-suited to parallelization. For example, each of the head-automata could be optimized independently in a multi-core or GPU architecture.

First, define \u03b4 = f (z (1) ) \u2212 f (y (1) ), where (z (1) , y (1) ) is the output of the algorithm on the first iteration (note that we always have \u03b4 \u2265 0 since f (z (1) ) = L(u (1) )). Then define \u03b1 k = \u03b4/(1 + \u03b7 k ), where \u03b7 k is the number of times that L(u (k ) ) > L(u (k \u22121) ) for k \u2264 k. Hence the learning rate drops at a rate of 1/(1 + t), where t is the number of times that the dual increases from one iteration to the next.\nA.2 Use of the \u03b3(i, j) Parameters\nThe parsing algorithms both consider a generalized problem that includes \u03b3(i, j) parameters. We now describe how these can be useful. Recall that the optimization problem is to solve argmax z\u2208Z,y\u2208Y f (z) + h(y), subject to a set of agreement constraints. In our models, f (z) can be written as f (z) + i,j \u03b1(i, j)z(i, j) where f (z) includes only terms depending on higherorder (non arc-factored features), and \u03b1(i, j) are weights that consider the dependency between i and j alone. For any value of 0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1, the problem argmax z\u2208Z,y\u2208Y f 2 (z) + h 2 (y) is equivalent to the original problem, if f 2 (z) = f (z) + (1 \u2212 \u03b2) i,j \u03b1(i, j)z(i, j) and h 2 (y) = \u03b2 i,j \u03b1(i, j)y(i, j). We have simply shifted the \u03b1(i, j) weights from one model to the other. While the optimization problem remains the same, the algorithms in Figure 1 and 2 will converge at different rates depending on the value for \u03b2. In our experiments we set \u03b2 = 0.001, which puts almost all the weight in the head-automata models, but allows weights on spanning tree edges to break ties in MST inference in a sensible way. We suspect this is important in early iterations of the algorithm, when many values for u(i, j) or v(i, j) will be zero, and where with \u03b2 = 0 many spanning tree solutions y (k) would be essentially random, leading to very noisy updates to the u(i, j) and v(i, j) values.
