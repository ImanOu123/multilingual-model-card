{"title": "Combining Outputs from Multiple Machine Translation Systems", "authors": "Antti-Veikko I Rosti; Necip Fazil; Bing Xiang; Spyros Matsoukas; Richard Schwartz; Bonnie J Dorr", "pub_date": "", "abstract": "Currently there are several approaches to machine translation (MT) based on different paradigms; e.g., phrasal, hierarchical and syntax-based. These three approaches yield similar translation accuracy despite using fairly different levels of linguistic knowledge. The availability of such a variety of systems has led to a growing interest toward finding better translations by combining outputs from multiple systems. This paper describes three different approaches to MT system combination. These combination methods operate on sentence, phrase and word level exploiting information from \u00a4 -best lists, system scores and target-to-source phrase alignments. The word-level combination provides the most robust gains but the best results on the development test sets (NIST MT05 and the newsgroup portion of GALE 2006 dry-run) were achieved by combining all three methods.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In recent years, machine translation systems based on new paradigms have emerged. These systems employ more than just the surface-level information used by the state-of-the-art phrase-based translation systems. For example, hierarchical (Chiang, 2005) and syntax-based (Galley et al., 2006) systems have recently improved in both accuracy and scalability.\nCombined with the latest advances in phrase-based translation systems, it has become more attractive to take advantage of the various outputs in forming consensus translations (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994;Bangalore et al., 2001;Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005;Matusov et al., 2006).\nSystem combination has been successfully applied in state-of-the-art speech recognition evaluation systems for several years (Fiscus, 1997). Even though the underlying modeling techniques are similar, many systems produce very different outputs with approximately the same accuracy. One of the most successful approaches is consensus network decoding (Mangu et al., 2000) which assumes that the confidence of a word in a certain position is based on the sum of confidences from each system output having the word in that position. This requires aligning the system outputs to form a consensus network and -during decoding -simply finding the highest scoring path through this network. The alignment of speech recognition outputs is fairly straightforward due to the strict constraint in word order. However, machine translation outputs do not have this constraint as the word order may be different between the source and target languages. MT systems employ various re-ordering (distortion) models to take this into account.\nThree MT system combination methods are presented in this paper. They operate on the sentence, phrase and word level. The sentence-level combination is based on selecting the best hypothesis out of the merged N-best lists. This method does not generate new hypotheses -unlike the phrase and word-level methods. The phrase-level combination is based on extracting sentence-specific phrase translation tables from system outputs with alignments to source and running a phrasal decoder with this new translation table. This approach is similar to the multi-engine MT framework proposed in (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994) which is not capable of re-ordering. The word-level combination is based on consensus network decoding. Translation edit rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006) is used to align the hypotheses and minimum Bayes risk decoding under TER (Sim et al., 2007) is used to select the alignment hypothesis. All combination methods use weights which may be tuned using Powell's method (Brent, 1973) on \u00a4 -best lists. Both sentence and phrase-level combination methods can generate \u00a4 best lists which may also be used as new system outputs in the word-level combination.\nExperiments on combining six machine translation system outputs were performed. Three systems were phrasal, two hierarchical and one syntaxbased. The systems were evaluated on NIST MT05 and the newsgroup portion of the GALE 2006 dryrun sets. The outputs were evaluated on both TER and BLEU. As the target evaluation metric in the GALE program was human-mediated TER (HTER) (Snover et al., 2006), it was found important to improve both of these automatic metrics.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the evaluation metrics and a generic discriminative optimization technique used in tuning of the various system combination weights. Sentence, phrase and word-level system combination methods are presented in Sections 3, 4 and 5. Experimental results on Arabic and Chinese to English newswire and newsgroup test data are presented in Section 6.", "publication_ref": ["b2", "b5", "b4", "b0", "b6", "b9", "b3", "b8", "b4", "b15", "b13", "b1", "b15"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Evaluation Metrics and Discriminative Tuning", "text": "The official metric of the 2006 DARPA GALE evaluation was human-mediated translation edit rate (HTER). HTER is computed as the minimum translation edit rate (TER) between a system output and a targeted reference which preserves the meaning and fluency of the sentence (Snover et al., 2006). The targeted reference is generated by human posteditors who make edits to a reference translation so as to minimize the TER between the reference and the MT output without changing the meaning of the reference. Computing the HTER is very time consuming due to the human post-editing. It is desirable to have an automatic evaluation metric that correlates well with the HTER to allow fast evaluation of the MT systems during development. Correlations of different evaluation metrics have been studied (Snover et al., 2006) but according to various internal HTER experiments it is not clear whether TER or BLEU correlates better. Therefore it is probably safest to try and not degrade either. The TER of a translation is computed as\n\u00a1 \u00a3 \u00a2 \u00a5 \u00a4 \u00a7 \u00a6 \u00a9 ! # \" % $ ' & ( ) \" 1 0 3 2 5 4 6 \" 7 0 3 8 5 9 A @ \u00a4 B C E D F D H G (1) where \u00a4 6\nis the total number of words in the reference translation . In the case of multiple references, the edits are counted against all references, \u00a4 is the average number of words in the reference translations and the final TER is computed using the minimum number of edits. The NIST BLEU-4 is a variant of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and is computed as All system combination methods presented in this paper may be tuned to directly optimize either one of these automatic evaluation metrics. The tuning uses \u00a4 -best lists of hypotheses with various feature scores. The feature scores may be combined with tunable weights forming an arbitrary scoring function. As the derivatives of this function are not usually available, Brent's modification of Powell's method (Brent, 1973) may be used to find weights that optimize the appropriate evaluation metric in the re-scored \u00a4 -best list. The optimization starts at a random initial point in the s -dimensional parameter space, first searching through an initial set of basis vectors. As searching repeatedly through the set of basis vectors is inefficient, the direction of the vectors is gradually moved toward a larger positive change in the evaluation metric. To improve the chances of finding a global optimum, the algorithm is repeated with varying initial values. The modified Powell's method has been previously used in optimizing the weights of a standard feature-based MT decoder in (Och, 2003) where a more efficient algorithm for log-linear models was proposed. However, this is specific to log-linear models and cannot be easily extended for more complicated functions.\nI Q P \u00a2 R S \u00a6 \u00a9 T U & W V 3 X \u1ef2 C a c b d e g f i", "publication_ref": ["b15", "b15", "b12", "b1", "b11"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Sentence-Level Combination", "text": "The first combination method is based on re-ranking a merged \u00a4 -best list.

Three systems were phrase-based (A, C and E), two hierarchical (B and D) and one syntax-based (F). The phrase-based systems used different sets of features and re-ordering approaches.\nThe hierarchical systems used different rule sets. All systems were tuned on NIST MT02 evaluation sets with four references. Systems A and B were tuned to minimize TER, the other systems were tuned to maximize BLEU. As discussed in Section 2, the system combination tuning metric was chosen so that gains were observed in both TER and BLEU on development test sets. NIST MT05 comprising only newswire data (1056 Arabic and 1082 Chinese sentences) with four reference translations and the newsgroup portion of the GALE 2006 dry-run (203 Arabic and 126 Chinese sentences) with one reference translation were used as the test sets. It was found that minimizing TER on Arabic also resulted in higher BLEU scores compared to the best single system. However,  The sentence and phrase-level combination weights were tuned on NIST MT03 evaluation sets. On the tuning sets, both methods yield about 0.5%-1.0% gain in TER and BLEU. The mixed-case TER and BLEU scores on both test sets are shown in Table 1 for Arabic and Table 2 for Chinese (phrcomb represents phrase and sentcomb sentence-level combination). The phrase-level combination seems to outperform the sentence-level combination in terms of both metrics on Arabic although gains over the best single system are modest, if any. On Chinese, the sentence-level combination yields higher BLEU scores than the phrase-level combination. The combination BLEU scores on the newsgroup data are not higher than the best system, though.\nThe word-level combination was evaluated in three settings. First, simple confusion network decoding with six systems without system weights was performed (no weights 6 in the tables). Second, system weights were trained for combining six systems (TER/BLEU 6 in the tables). Finally, all six system outputs as well as the sentence and phrase-level combination outputs were combined with system weights (TER/BLEU 8 in the tables). The 6-way combination weights were tuned on merged NIST MT03 and MT04 evaluation sets and the 8-way combination weights were tuned only on NIST MT04 since the sentence and phraselevel combination methods were already tuned on NIST MT03. The word-level combination yields about 2.0%-3.0% gain in TER and 2.0%-4.0% gain in BLEU on the tuning sets. The test set results show that the simple confusion network decoding without system weights yields very good scores, mostly better than either sentence or phrase-level combination. The system weights seem to yield even higher BLEU scores but not always lower TER scores on both languages. Despite slightly hurting the TER score on Arabic, the TER 8 combination result was considered the best due to the highest BLEU and significantly lower TER compared to any single system. Similarly, the BLEU 8 was considered the best combination result on Chinese. Internal HTER experiments showed that BLEU 8 yielded lower scores after post-editing even though no weights 6 had lower automatic TER score.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_8"]}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "Three methods for machine translation system combination were presented in this paper. The sentencelevel combination was based on re-ranking a merged \u00a4 -best list using generalized linear models with features derived from each system's output. The combination yields slight gains on the tuning set. However, the gains were very small, if any, on the test sets. The re-ranked \u00a4 -best lists were used successfully in the word-level combination method as new system outputs. Various other features may be explored in this framework although the tuning may be limited by the chosen optimization method in the higher dimensional parameter space.\nThe phrase-level combination was based on deriving a new phrase translation table from the alignments to source provided in all system outputs. The phrase translation scores were based on the level of agreement between the system outputs and sentence posterior estimates. A standard phrasal decoder with the new phrase table was used to produce the final combination output. The handling of the alignments from non-phrasal decoders may not be optimal, though. The phrase-level combination yields fairly good gains on the tuning sets. However, the performance does not seem to generalize to the test sets used in this work. As usual, the phrasal decoder can generate \u00a4 -best lists which were used successfully in the word-level combination method as new system outputs.\nThe word-level combination method based on consensus network decoding seems to be very robust and yield good gains over the best single system even without any tunable weights. The decision of the skeleton is crucial. Minimum Bayes Risk decoding under translation edit rate was used to select the skeleton. Compared to the best possible skeleton decision -according to an oracle experiment -further gains might be obtained by using better decision approach. Also, the alignment may be improved by taking the target-to-source alignments into account and allowing synonyms to align. The confusion network decoding at the word level does not necessarily retain coherent phrases as no language model constraints are taken into account. LM re-scoring might alleviate this problem.\nThis paper has provided evidence that outputs from six very different MT systems, tuned for two different evaluation metrics, may be combined to yield better outputs in terms of different evaluation metrics.
