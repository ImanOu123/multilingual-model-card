Our work is based on the hypothesis that syntax provides a proxy for the communicative goal of a sentence and therefore the sequence of sentences in a coherent discourse should exhibit detectable structural patterns. Results show that our method has high discriminating power for separating out coherent and incoherent news articles reaching accuracies of up to 90%. We also show that our syntactic patterns are correlated with manual annotations of intentional structure for academic conference articles and can successfully predict the coherence of abstract, introduction and related work sections of these articles.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Recent studies have introduced successful automatic methods to predict the structure and coherence of texts. They include entity approaches for local coherence which track the repetition and syntactic realization of entities in adjacent sentences (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008;Elsner and Charniak, 2008) and content approaches for global coherence which view texts as a sequence of topics, each characterized by a particular distribution of lexical items (Barzilay and Lee, 2004;Fung and Ngai, 2006). Other work has shown that co-occurrence of words (Lapata, 2003;Soricut and Marcu, 2006) and discourse relations (Pitler and Nenkova, 2008;Lin et al., 2011) also predict coherence.\nEarly theories (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) posited that there are three factors which collectively con-tribute to coherence: intentional structure (purpose of discourse), attentional structure (what items are discussed) and the organization of discourse segments. The highly successful entity approaches capture attentional structure and content approaches are related to topic segments but intentional structure has largely been neglected. Every discourse has a purpose: explaining a concept, narrating an event, critiquing an idea and so on. As a result each sentence in the article has a communicative goal and the sequence of goals helps the author achieve the discourse purpose. In this work, we introduce a model to capture coherence from the intentional structure dimension. Our key proposal is that syntactic patterns are a useful proxy for intentional structure.\nThis idea is motivated from the fact that certain sentence types such as questions and definitions have distinguishable and unique syntactic structure. For example, consider the opening sentences of two descriptive articles 1 shown in Table 1. Sentences (1a) and (2a) are typical instances of definition sentences. Definitions are written with the concept to be defined expressed as a noun phrase followed by a copular verb (is/are). The predicate contains two parts: the first is a noun phrase reporting the concept as part of a larger class (eg. an aqueduct is a water supply), the second component is a relative clause listing unique properties of the concept. These are examples of syntactic patterns related to the communicative goals of individual sentences. Similarly, sentences (1b) and (2b) which provide further details about the concept also have some distinguish-1a) An aqueduct is a water supply or navigable channel constructed to convey water. b) In modern engineering, the term is used for any system of pipes, canals, tunnels, and other structures used for this purpose. 2a) Cytokine receptors are receptors that binds cytokines. b) In recent years, the cytokine receptors have come to demand more attention because their deficiency has now been directly linked to certain debilitating immunodeficiency states.\nTable 1: The first two sentences of two descriptive articles ing syntactic features such as the presence of a topicalized phrase providing the focus of the sentence. The two sets of sentences have similar sequence of communicative goals and so we can expect the syntax of adjacent sentences to also be related.\nWe aim to characterize this relationship on a broad scale using a coherence model based entirely on syntax. The model relies on two assumptions which summarize our intuitions about syntax and intentional structure:\n1. Sentences with similar syntax are likely to have the same communicative goal.\n2. Regularities in intentional structure will be manifested in syntactic regularities between adjacent sentences.\nThere is also evidence from recent work that supports these assumptions. Cheung and Penn (2010) find that a better syntactic parse of a sentence can be derived when the syntax of adjacent sentences is also taken into account. Lin et al. (2009) report that the syntactic productions in adjacent sentences are powerful features for predicting which discourse relation (cause, contrast, etc.) holds between them. Cocco et al. (2011) show that significant associations exist between certain part of speech tags and sentence types such as explanation, dialog and argumentation.\nIn our model, syntax is represented either as parse tree productions or a sequence of phrasal nodes augmented with part of speech tags. Our best performing method uses a Hidden Markov Model to learn the patterns in these syntactic items. Sections 3 and 5 discuss the representations and their specific implementations and relative advantages. Results show that syntax models can distinguish coherent and incoherent news articles from two domains with 75-90% accuracies over a 50% baseline. In addition, the syntax coherence scores turn out complementary to scores given by lexical and entity models.\nWe also study our models' predictions on academic articles, a genre where intentional structure is widely studied. Sections in these articles have well-defined purposes and we find recurring sentence types such as motivation, citations, description, and speculations. There is a large body of work (Swales, 1990;Teufel et al., 1999;Liakata et al., 2010) concerned with defining and annotating these sentence types (called zones) in conference articles. In Section 6, we describe how indeed some patterns captured by the syntax-based models are correlated with zone categories that were proposed in prior literature. We also present results on coherence prediction: our model can distinguish the introduction section of conference papers from its perturbed versions with over 70% accuracy. Further, our model is able to identify conference from workshop papers with good accuracies, given that we can expect these articles to vary in purpose.", "publication_ref": ["b0", "b8", "b1", "b11", "b18", "b28", "b24", "b22", "b12", "b4", "b21", "b5", "b29", "b31", "b20"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Evidence for syntactic coherence", "text": "We first present a pilot study that confirms that adjacent sentences in discourse exhibit stable patterns of syntactic co-occurrence. This study validates our second assumption relating the syntax of adjacent sentences. Later in Section 6, we examine syntactic patterns in individual sentences (assumption 1) using a corpus of academic articles where sentences were manually annotated with communicative goals.\nPrior work has reported that certain grammatical productions are repeated in adjacent sentences more often than would be expected by chance (Reitter et al., 2006;Cheung and Penn, 2010). We analyze all co-occurrence patterns rather than just repetitions.\nWe use the gold standard parse trees from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994). Our unit of analysis is a pair of adjacent sentences (S 1 , S 2 ) and we choose to use Section 0 of the corpus which has 99 documents and 1727 sentence pairs. We enumerate all productions that appear in the syntactic parse of any sentence and exclude those that appear less than 25 times, resulting in a list of 197 unique productions. Then all ordered pairs 2 (p 1 , p 2 ) of productions are formed. For each pair, we compute p1, p2  the following: c(p 1 p 2 ) = number of sentence pairs where p 1 \u2208 S 1 and p 2 \u2208 S 2 ; c(p 1 \u00acp 2 ) = number of pairs where p 1 \u2208 S 1 and p 2 \u2208 S 2 ; c(\u00acp 1 p 2 ) and c(\u00acp 1 \u00acp 2 ) are computed similarly. Then we perform a chi-square test to understand if the observed count c(p 1 p 2 ) is significantly (95% confidence level) greater or lesser than the expected value if occurrences of p 1 and p 2 were independent.\nOf the 38,809 production pairs, we found that 1,168 pairs occurred in consecutive sentences significantly more often than chance and 172 appeared significantly fewer times than expected. In Table 2 we list, grouped in three simple categories, the 25 pairs of the first kind with most significant p-values.\nSome of the preferred pairs are indeed repetitions as pointed out by prior work. But they form only a small fraction (5%) of the total preferred production pairs indicating that there are several other classes of syntactic regularities beyond priming. Some of these other sequences can be explained by the fact that these articles come from the finance domain: they involve productions containing numbers and quantities. An example for this type is shown in Table 2. Finally, there is also a class that is not repetitions or readily observed as domain-specific. The most frequent one reflects a pattern where the first sentence introduces a subject and predicate and the subject in the second sentence is pronominalized. Examples for two other patterns are given in Table 2. For the sequence (VP \u2192 VB VP | NP-SBJ \u2192 NNP NNP), a bare verb is present in S 1 and is often associated with modals. In the corpus, these statements often present hypothesis or speculation. The following sentence S 2 has an entity, a person or organization, giving an explanation or opinion on the statement. This pattern roughly correponds to a SPECU-LATE followed by ENDORSE sequence of intentions.  Similarly, in all the six adjacent sentence pairs from our corpus containing the items (NP-LOC \u2192 NNP | S-TPC-1 \u2192 NP-SBJ VP), p 1 introduces a location name, and is often associated with the title of a person or organization. The next sentence has a quote from that person, where the quotation forms the topicalized clause in p 2 .

We derive representations from constituent parses of the sentences, and terminals (words) are removed from the parse tree before any processing is done. The leaf nodes in our parse trees are part of speech tags. Productions: In this representation we view each sentence as the set of grammatical productions, LHS \u2192 RHS, which appear in the parse of the sentence. As we already pointed out, the right-hand side (RHS) contains only non-terminal nodes. This representation is straightforward, however, some productions can be rather specific with long right hand sides. Another apparent drawback of this representation is that it contains sequence information only about nodes that belong to the same constituent. d-sequence: In this representation we aim to preserve more sequence information about adjacent constituents in the sentence. The simplest approach would be to represent the sentence as the sequence of part of speech (POS) tags but then we lose all the abstraction provided by higher level nodes in tree. Instead, we introduce a more general representation, d-sequence where the level of abstraction can be controlled using a parameter d. The parse tree is truncated to depth at most d, and the leaves of the resulting tree listed left to right form the d-sequence representation. For example, in Figure 1, the line depicts the cutoff at depth 2.\nNext the representation is further augmented; all phrasal nodes in the d-sequence are annotated (concatenated) with the left-most leaf that they dominate in the full non-lexicalized parse tree. This is shown as suffixes on the S, NP and VP nodes in the figure. Such annotation conveys richer information about the structure of the subtree below nodes in the d-sequence. For example, \"the chairs\", \"his chairs\", \"comfortable chairs\" will be represented as NP DT , NP PRP$ and NP JJ . In the resulting representations, sentences are viewed as sequences of syntactic words (w 1 ,w 2 ...,w k ), k \u2264 p, where p is the length of the full POS sequence and each w i is either POS tag or a phrasal node+POS tag combination. In our example, at depth-2, the quotation sentence gets the representation (w1=\" , w2=SDT , w3=, , w4=\" , w5=NPNNP , w6=VPVBD , w7=.) where the actual quote is omitted. Sentences that contain attributions are likely to appear more similar to each other when compared using this representation in contrast to representations derived from word or POS sequence. The depth-3 sequence is also indicated in the figure.\nThe main verb of a sentence is central to its structure, so the parameter d is always set to be greater than that of the main verb and is tuned to optimize performance for coherence prediction.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Implementing the model", "text": "We adapt two models of coherence to operate over the two syntactic representations.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Local co-occurrence model", "text": "This model is a direct extension from our pilot study. It allows us to test the assumption that coherent discourse is characterized by syntactic regularities in adjacent sentences. We estimate the probabilities of pairs of syntactic items from adjacent sentences in the training data and use these probabilities to compute the coherence of new texts.\nThe coherence of a text T containing n sentences (S 1 ...S n ) is computed as:\nP (T ) = n i=2 |S i | j=1 1 |S i\u22121 | |S i\u22121 | k=1 p(S j i |S k i\u22121 )\nwhere S y x indicates the y th item of S x .

This approach uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which has been a popular implementation for modeling coherence (Barzilay and Lee, 2004;Fung and Ngai, 2006;Elsner et al., 2007). The hidden states in our model depict communicative goals by encoding a probability distribution over syntactic items. This distribution gives higher weight to syntactic items that are more likely for that communicative goal. Transitions between states record the common patterns in intentional structure for the domain.\nIn this syntax-HMM, states h k are created by clustering the sentences from the documents in the training set by syntactic similarity. For the productions representation of syntax, the features for clustering are the number of times a given production appeared in the parse of the sentence. For the d-sequence approach, the features are n-grams of size one to four of syntactic words from the sequence. Clustering was done by optimizing for average cosine similarity and was implemented using the CLUTO toolkit (Zhao et al., 2005). C clusters are formed and taken as the states of the model. Table 4 shows sentences from two clusters formed on the abstracts of journal articles using the productions representation. One of them, cluster (a), appears to capture descriptive sentences and cluster (b) involves mostly speculation type sentences.\nThe emission probabilities for each state are modeled as a (syntactic) language model derived from the sentences in it. For productions representation, this is the unigram distribution of productions from the sentences in h k . For d-sequences, the distribution is computed for bigrams of syntactic words. These language models use Lidstone smoothing with constant \u03b4 E . The probability for a sentence S l to be generated from state h k , p E (S l |h k ) is computed using these syntactic language models.\nThe transition probability p M from a state h i to state h j is computed as:\np M (h j |h i ) = d(h i , h j ) + \u03b4 M d(h i ) + \u03b4 M * C\nwhere d(h i ) is the number of documents whose sentences appear in h i and d(h i , h j ) is the number of documents which have a sentence in h i which is immediately followed by a sentence in h j . In addition to the C states, we add one initial h S and one final h F state to capture document beginning and end. Transitions from h S to any state h k records how likely it is for h k to be the starting state for documents of that domain. \u03b4 M is a smoothing constant.\nThe likelihood of a text with n sentences is given by\nP (T ) = h1...hn n t=1 p M (h t |h t\u22121 )p E (S t |h t ).\nAll model parameters-the number of clusters C, smoothing constants \u03b4 C , \u03b4 E , \u03b4 M and d for d-sequences-are tuned to optimize how well the model can distinguish coherent from incoherent articles.

These approaches are the most popular ones from prior work and also allow us to test the complementary nature of syntax with lexical statistics and entity structure. This section explains how we implemented these approaches.\nContent models introduced by Barzilay and Lee (2004) and Fung and Ngai (2006) use lexically driven HMMs to capture coherence. The hidden states represent the topics of the domain and encode a probability distribution over words. Transitions between states record the probable succession of topics. We built a content model using our HMM implementation. Clusters are created using word bigram features after replacing numbers and proper names with tags NUM and PROP. The emissions are given by a bigram language model on words from the clustered sentences. Barzilay and Lee (2004) also employ an iterative clustering procedure before finalizing the states of the HMM but our method only uses one-step clustering. Despite the difference, the content model accuracies for our implementation are quite close to that from the original.\nFor the entity grid model, we follow the generative approach proposed by Lapata and Barzilay (2005). A text is converted into a matrix, where rows correspond to sentences, in the order in which they appear in the article. Columns are created one for each entity appearing in the text. Each cell (i,j) is filled with the grammatical role r i,j of the entity j in sentence i. We computed the entity grids using the Brown Coherence Toolkit 4 . The probability of the text (T ) is defined using the likely sequence of grammatical role transitions.\nP (T ) = m j=1 n i=1 p(r i,j |r i\u22121,j ...r i\u2212h,j )\nfor m entities and n sentences. Parameter h controls the history size for transitions and is tuned during development. When h = 1, for example, only the grammatical role for the entity in the previous sentence is considered and earlier roles are ignored.", "publication_ref": ["b1", "b11", "b1", "b17"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Evaluating syntactic coherence", "text": "We follow the common approach from prior work and use pairs of articles, where one has the original document order and the other is a random permutation of the sentences from the same document. Since the original article is always more coherent than a random permutation, a model can be evaluated using the accuracy with which it can identify the original article in the pair, i.e. it assigns higher probability to the original article. This setting is not ideal but has become the de facto standard for evaluation of coherence models (Barzilay and Lee, 2004;Elsner et al., 2007;Barzilay and Lapata, 2008;Karamanis et al., 2009;Lin et al., 2011;Elsner and Charniak, 2011). It is however based on a reasonable assumption as recent work (Lin et al., 2011) shows that people identify the original article as more coherent than its permutations with over 90% accuracy and assessors also have high agreement. Later, we present an experiment distinguishing conference from workshop articles as a more realistic evaluation.\nWe use two corpora that are widely employed for coherence prediction (Barzilay and Lee, 2004;Elsner et al., 2007;Barzilay and Lapata, 2008;Lin et al., 2011). One contains reports on airplane accidents from the National Transportation Safety Board and the other has reports about earthquakes from the Associated Press. These articles are about 10 sentences long. These corpora were chosen since within each dataset, the articles have the same intentional structure. Further, these corpora are also standard ones used in prior work on lexical, entity and discourse relation based coherence models. Later in Section 6, we show that the models perform well on the academic genre and longer articles too.\nFor each of the two corpora, we have 100 articles for training and 100 (accidents) and 99 (earthquakes) for testing. A maximum of 20 random permutations were generated for each test article to create the pairwise data (total of 1986 test pairs for the accident corpus and 1956 for earthquakes). 5 The baseline accuracy for random prediction is 50%.

The best number of clusters and depth for d-sequences are also indicated. Overall, the syntax models work quite well, with accuracies at least 15% or more absolute improvement over the baseline.\nIn the local co-occurrence approach, both productions and d-sequences provide 72% accuracy for the accidents corpus. For the earthquake corpus, the accuracies are lower and the d-sequence method works better. The best depth setting for d-sequence is rather small: depth of main verb (MVP) + 2 (or 1), and indicates that a fairly abstract level of nodes is preferred for the patterns. For comparison, we also provide results using just the POS tags in the model and this is worse than the d-sequence approach.\nThe global HMM model is better than the local model for each representation type giving 2 to 38% better accuracies. Here we see a different trend for the d-sequence representation, with better results for greater depths. At such depths (8 and 9) below the main verb, the nodes are mostly POS tags.\nOverall both productions and d-sequence work competitively and give the best accuracies when implemented with the global approach.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Comparison with other approaches", "text": "For our implementations of the content and entity grid models, the best accuracies are 71% on the accidents corpus and 85% on the earthquakes one, similar to the syntactic models.\nIdeally, we would like to combine models but we do not have separate training data. So we perform the following classification experiment which combines the predictions made by different models on the test set. Each test pair (article and permutation) forms one example and is given a class value of 0 or 1 depending on whether the first article in the pair is the original one or the second one. The example is represented as an n-dimensional vector, where n is the number of models we wish to combine. For instance, to combine content models and entity grid, two features are created: one of these records the difference in log probabilities for the two articles from the content model, the other feature indicates the difference in probabilities from the entity grid.\nA logistic regression classifier is trained to predict the class using these features.   6: Accuracies for combined approaches class 0 and 1, so the baseline accuracy is 50%. We run this experiment using 10-fold cross validation on the test set after first obtaining the log probabilities from individual models. In each fold, the training is done using the pairs from 90 articles and tested on permutations from the remaining 10 articles. These accuracies are reported in Table 6. When the accuracy of a combination is better than that using any of its smaller subsets, the value is bolded.\nWe find that syntax supplements both content and entity grid methods. While on the airplane corpus syntax only combines well with the entity grid, on the earthquake corpus, both entity and content approaches give better accuracies when combined with syntax. However, adding all three approaches does not outperform combinations of any two of them. This result can be due to the simple approach that we tested for combination. In prior work, content and entity grid methods have been combined generatively (Elsner et al., 2007) and using discriminative training with different objectives (Soricut and Marcu, 2006).

ART Corpus: contains a set of 225 Chemistry journal articles that were manually annotated for intentional structure (Liakata and Soldatova, 2008). Each sentence was assigned one of 11 zone labels: Result, Conclusion, Objective, Method, Goal, Background, Observation, Experiment, Motivation, Model, Hypothesis.

Similarly, we obtain a development corpus of 36 ACL-NAACL articles. We create two test sets: one has 500 ACL-NAACL conference articles and another has 500 articles from ACL-sponsored workshops. We only choose articles in which all three sections-abstract, introduction and related work-could be successfully identified using Parscit. 8 This data was sentence-segmented using MxTerminator (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) and parsed with the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).\nFor each corpus and each section, we train all our syntactic models: the two local coherence models using the production and d-sequence representations and the HMM models with the two representations.

These models were chosen because they gave the best performance on the ART corpus development sets. 9 We examine the clusters created by these models on the training data and check whether there are clusters which strongly involve sentences from some particular annotated zone.\nFor each possible pair of cluster and zone (C i , Z j ), we compute c(C i , Z j ): the number of sentences in C i that are annotated as zone Z j . Then we use a chi-square test to identify pairs for which c(C i , Z j ) is significantly greater than expected (there is a \"positive\" association between C i and Z j ) and pairs where c(C i , Z j ) is significantly less than chance (C i is not associated with Z j ).

We use the same experimental setup as before and create pairs of original and permuted versions of the test articles. We created a maximum of 20 permutations for each article. The baseline accuracy is 50% as before.\nFor the ART corpus, we also built an oracle model of annotated zones. We train a first order Markov Chain to record the sequence of zones in the training articles. For testing, we assume that the oracle zone is provided for each sentence and use the model to predict the likelihood of the zone sequence. Results from this model represent an upper bound because an accurate hypothesis of the communicative goal is available for each sentence.\nThe accuracies are presented in Table 8. Overall, the HMM-d-seq model provides the best accuracies. The highest results are obtained for ACL introduction sections (74%). These results are lower than that obtained on the earthquake/accident corpus but the task here is much harder: the articles are longer and the ACL corpus also has OCR errors which affect sentence segmentation and parsing accuracies. When the oracle zones are known, the accuracies are much higher on the ART corpus indicating that the intentional structure of academic articles is very predictive of their coherence.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Conference versus workshop papers", "text": "Finally, we test whether the syntax-based model can distinguish the structure of conference from workshop articles. Conferences publish more complete and tested work and workshops often present preliminary studies. Workshops are also venues to discuss a focused and specialized topic. So the way information is conveyed in the abstracts and introductions would vary in these articles.\nWe perform this analysis on the ACL corpus and no permutations are used, only the original text of the 500 articles each in the conference and workshop test sets. While permutation examples provide cheap training/test data, they have a few unrealistic properties. For example, both original and permuted articles have the same length. Further some permutations could result in an outstandingly incoherent sample which is easily distinguished from the original articles. So we use the conference versus workshop task as another evaluation of our model.\nWe designed a classification experiment for this task which combines features from the different syntax models that were trained on the ACL conference training set. We include four features indicating the perplexity of an article under each model (Localprod, Local-d-seq, HMM-prod, HMM-d-seq). We use perplexity rather than probability because the length of the articles vary widely in contrast to the previous permutation-based tests, where both permutation and original article have the same length. We compute perplexity as P (T ) \u22121/n , where n is the number of words in the article. We also obtain the most likely state sequence for the article under  These results are shown in Table 9. The proportion of examples under each setting is also indicated.\nWhen only examples above 0.6 confidence are examined, the classifier has a higher accuracy of 63.8% for abstracts and covers close to 70% of the examples. Similarly, when a cutoff of 0.7 is applied to the confidence for predicting related work sections, we achieve 63.3% accuracy for 53% of examples. So we can consider that 30 to 47% of the examples in the two sections respectively are harder to tell apart. Interestingly however even high confidence predictions on introductions remain incorrect.\nThese results show that our model can successfully distinguish the structure of articles beyond just clearly incoherent permutation examples.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_10"]}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Our work is the first to develop an unsupervised model for intentional structure and to show that it has good accuracy for coherence prediction and also complements entity and lexical structure of discourse. This result raises interesting questions about how patterns captured by these different coherence metrics vary and how they can be combined usefully for predicting coherence. We plan to explore these ideas in future work. We also want to analyze genre differences to understand if the strength of these coherence dimensions varies with genre.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "This work is partially supported by a Google research grant and NSF CAREER 0953445 award.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "", "text": "HMM-prod and HMM-d-seq models using Viterbi decoding. Then the proportion of sentences from each state of the two models are added as features.\nWe also add some fine-grained features from the local model. We represent sentences in the training set as either productions or d-sequence items and compute pairs of associated items (x i , x j ) from adjacent sentences using the same chi-square test as in our pilot study. The most significant (lowest pvalues) 30 pairs (each for production and d-seq) are taken as features. 10 For a test article, we compute features that represent how often each pair is present in the article such that x i is in S m and x j is in S m+1 .\nWe perform this experiment for each section and there are about 90 to 140 features for the different sections. We cast the problem as a binary classification task: conference articles belong to one class and workshop to the other. Each class has 500 articles and so the baseline random accuracy is 50%. We perform 10-fold cross validation using logistic regression. Our results were 59.3% accuracy for distinguishing abstracts of conference verus workshop, 50.3% for introductions and 55.4% for related work. For abstracts and related work, these accuracies are significantly better than baseline (95% confidence level from a two-sided paired t-test comparing the accuracies from the 10 folds). It is possible that introductions in either case, talk in general about the field and importance of the problem addressed and hence have similar structure.\nOur accuracies are not as high as on permutations examples because the task is clearly harder. It may also be the case that the prediction is more difficult for certain papers than for others. So we also analyze our results by the confidence provided by the classifier for the predicted class.
