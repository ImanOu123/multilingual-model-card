When the underlying process can be modeled by parameters in a Euclidean space, classical regression techniques [13,34] are applicable and have been studied extensively. However, recent work suggests that attempts to describe anatomical shapes using flat Euclidean spaces undermines our ability to represent natural biological variability [9,11]. In this paper we develop a method for regression analysis of general, manifold-valued data. Specifically, we extend Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression by recasting the regression problem in terms of Fr\u00e9chet expectation. Although this method is quite general, our driving problem is the study anatomical shape change as a function of age from random design image data. We demonstrate our method by analyzing shape change in the brain from a random design dataset of MR images of 89 healthy adults ranging in age from 22 to 79 years. To study the small scale changes in anatomy, we use the infinite dimensional manifold of diffeomorphic transformations, with an associated metric. We regress a representative anatomical shape, as a function of age, from this population.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "An important area of medical image analysis is the development of methods for automated and computer-assisted assessment of anatomical change over time. For example, the analysis of structural brain change over time is important for understanding healthy aging. These methods also provide markers for understanding disease progression.\nA number of longitudinal growth models have been developed to provide this type of analysis to time-series imagery of a single subject (e.g., [2,7,24,32]). While these methods provide important results, their use is limited by their reliance on longitudinal data, which can be impractical to obtain for many medical studies. Also, while these methods allow for the study of an individual's anatomy over time, they do not apply when the average growth for a population is of interest.\nRandom design data sets, which contain anatomical data from many different individuals, provide a rich environment for addressing these problems. However, in order to detect time-related trends in such data, two distinct aspects of anatomical variation must be separated: individual variation and time effect. For measurements that naturally form Euclidean vector spaces, this separation can be achieved by regressing a representative value over time from the data.\nFor example, in Figure 1 we apply kernel regression to measurements reported in a study by Mortamet et al. [28] on the effect of aging on gray matter and ventricle volume in the brain. The regression curves demonstrate the average volume, as a function of patient age, of these structures. These trends-on average there is a loss of gray matter and expansion of the ventricles-have been widely reported in the medical literature on aging [12,23,28]. While volumebased regression analysis is important, it does not provide any information about the detailed shape changes that occur in the brain, on average, as a function of age. This has motivated us to study regression of shapes.\nRecent work has suggested that representing the geome-Accepted to the 11th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2007) Winner of the David Marr Prize for Best Paper try of shapes in flat Euclidean vector spaces limits our ability to represent natural variability in populations [9,11,24]. For example, Figure 2 demonstrates the amazing non-linear variability in brain shape among a population of healthy adults. The analysis of transformation groups that describe shape change are essential to understanding this shape variability. These groups vary in dimensionality from simple rigid rotations to the infinite-dimensional group of diffeomorphisms [26]. These groups are not generally vector spaces and are instead naturally represented as manifolds.\nA number of authors have contributed to the field of statistical analysis on manifolds (see Pennec [30] for a more detailed history). Early work on manifold statistics includes directional statistics [5,16] and statistics of point set shape spaces [19,20]. The large sample properties of sample means on manifolds are developed in [3,4]. Jupp and Kent [17] describe a method of regression of spherical data that 'unwraps' the data onto a tangent plane, where standard curve fitting methods can be applied. In [9,14,30], statistical concepts such as averaging and principal components analysis were extended to manifolds representing anatomical shape variability. Many of the ideas are based on the method of averaging in metric spaces proposed by Fr\u00e9chet [10].\nIn this paper we use the notion of Fr\u00e9chet expectation to generalize regression to manifold-valued data. We use this method to study spatio-temporal anatomical shape change in a random design database consisting of threedimensional MR images of healthy adults. Our method generalizes Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression in order to compute representative images of this population over time. To determine the shape change in the population over time, we apply a diffeomorphic growth model [24] to this timeindexed population representative image.", "publication_ref": ["b1", "b6", "b23", "b31", "b27", "b11", "b22", "b27", "b8", "b10", "b23", "b25", "b29", "b4", "b15", "b18", "b19", "b2", "b3", "b16", "b8", "b13", "b29", "b9", "b23"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Review of univariate kernel regression", "text": "Univariate kernel regression [13,34] is a non-parametric method used to estimate the relationship, on average, between an independent random variable T and a dependent random variable Y . The estimation is based on a set of observations {t i , y i } N i=1 drawn from the joint distribution of T and Y . This relationship between T and Y can be modeled as y i = m(t i ) + i , where i describes the random error of the model for the ith observation and m is the unknown function that is to be estimated.\nIn this setting, m(t) is defined by the conditional expectation\nm(t) \u2261 E(Y |T = t) = y f (t, y) f T (t) dy (1)\nwhere f T (t) is the marginal density of T and f (t, y) is the joint density function of T and Y . For random design data, both f (t, y) and f T (t) are unknown and so m has no closedform solution. A number of estimators for m have been proposed in the kernel regression literature.\nOne such estimator-the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression estimator [29,35]-can be derived from (1) by replacing the unknown densities with their kernel density estimatesf\nh T (t) \u2261 1 N N i=1 K h (t \u2212 t i )(2)\nand\nf h,g (t, y) \u2261 1 N N i=1 K h (t \u2212 t i )K g (y \u2212 y i ).(3)\nIn these equations, K is a function that satisfies\nR K(t) dt = 1.

To demonstrate the extent of natural brain shape variability within a population of healthy subjects, a mid-axial slice is presented for a sample of images used in this study. The images are arranged in order of increasing patient age from 40 (left) to 50 (right). Because of the complexity of the shapes and the high level of natural shape variability, it is extremely difficult to visually discern any patterns within these data.\nIntuitively, the Nadaraya-Watson estimator returns the weighted average of the observations y i , with the weighting determined by the kernel. Note thatf h,g (t, y) is factored out of the estimator-the weights only depend on the values t i .\nIn Figure 1 we illustrate univariate kernel regression by applying it to demonstrate the effect of aging on ventricle volume and gray matter volume in the brain. This illustration is based on data collected by Mortamet et al. [28]. Each cross-mark represents a volume measurement, relative to total brain volume, for a particular patient. These measurements were derived from 3D MR images of 50 healthy adults ranging in age from 20 to 72 using an expectationmaximization based automatic segmentation method [21]. We used kernel regression to estimate the relationship, on average, between volume and patient age (filled lines).

Let {t i , p i } N i=1 be a collection of observations where the t i are drawn from a univariate random variable T , but where p i are points on a Riemannian manifold M. The classical kernel regression methods presented in Section 2.1 are not applicable in this setting because they rely on the vector space structure of the observations. In particular, the addition operator in (5) is not well defined.\nThe goal is to determine the relationship, on average, between the independent variable T and the distribution of the points {p i } on the manifold. This relationship can be modeled by\np i = Exp m(ti) ( i )(6)\nwhere m : R \u2192 M defines a curve on M. The error term i \u2208 T m(ti) M is a tangent vector that is interpreted as the displacement along the manifold of each observation p i from the curve m(t). The exponential mapping, Exp, returns the point on M at time one along the geodesic flow beginning at m(t i ) with initial velocity i .\nFollowing the univariate case, we define the regression function m(t) in terms of expectation. However, in this case we generalize the idea of expectation of real random variables to manifold-valued random variables via Fr\u00e9chet expectation [10,18]. Let f (p), p \u2208 M be a probability density on the manifold. The Fr\u00e9chet expectation is defined as\nE f [p] \u2261 argmin q\u2208M M d(q, p) 2 f (p)(7)\nwhere d(q, m) is the metric on the manifold M. This definition is motivated by a minimum variance characterization of the mean, where variance is defined in terms of the metric. Note that Fr\u00e9chet expectation might not be unique [18]. Using the above definition, an empirical estimate of the Fr\u00e9chet mean, given a collection of observations\n{p i , i = 1 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 N } on a manifold M, is defined by \u00b5 = argmin q\u2208M 1 N N i d(q, p i ) 2 .\nMotivated by the definition of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator as a weighted averaging, we define a manifold kernel regression estimator using the weighted Fr\u00e9chet empirical mean estimator a\u015d\nm h (t) = argmin q\u2208M N i=1 K h (t \u2212 t i )d(q, p i ) 2 N i=1 K h (t \u2212 t i )\n.

The tangent space of SO(3) at the identity is the Lie algebra of 3\u00d73 skew-symmetric matrices, denoted so(3). We equip SO(3) with the standard bi-invariant metric, given by the Frobenius inner product on so(3). The tangent space at an arbitrary rotation R \u2208 SO(3) is given by either left or right multiplication of so(3) by R.\nThe Lie group exponential map and its inverse, the log map, are used to compute geodesics and distances.

We have observations of the form {t i , I i } N i=1 where t i is the age of patient i and I i is a threedimensional image that we identify with the anatomical configuration of patient i. We seek the unknown function m that associates a representative anatomical configuration, and its associated image\u00ce, with each age.\nIt is important to point out that we cannot rely on the natural L 2 structure of the images themselves for our analysis. While images can be added voxel-wise, the result is a loss of any identification with the anatomical configuration. Instead, we represent anatomical differences in terms of transformations of the underlying image coordinates. This approach is common within the shape analysis literature [11,25]. Because we are interested in capturing the large, natural geometric variability evident in the brain (cf. Figure 2), we represent shape change as the action of the group of diffeomorphisms, denoted by H. In the rest of this section, we formalize this notion and define a distance between shapes that is valid in this setting and will allow us to apply our regression methodology.\nLet \u2126 \u2282 R 3 be the underlying coordinate system of the observed images I i . Each image I \u2208 I can be formally defined as an L 2 function from \u2126 to the reals. Let H be the group of diffeomorphisms that are isotopic to the identity. Each element \u03c6 : \u2126 \u2192 \u2126 in H deforms an image according to the following rule\nI \u03c6 (x) = I(\u03c6 \u22121 (x)). (9\n)\nWe apply the theory of large deformation diffeomorphisms [1,8,15,26] to generate deformations \u03c6 that are solutions to the Lagrangian ODEs d ds \u03c6 s (x) = v s (\u03c6 s (x)) for a simulated time parameter s \u2208 [0, 1]. The transformations are generated by integrating the velocity fields v forward in time.\nWe introduce a metric on H using a Sobelev norm via a partial differential operator L applied to v. Let e \u2208 H be the identity transformation. We define the squared metric\nd H (e, \u03c6) 2 as d H (e, \u03c6) 2 = min v:\u03c6s=vs(\u03c6s) 1 0 \u2126 ||Lv s (x)|| 2 dx ds (10) subject to \u03c6(x) = x + 1 0 v s (\u03c6 s (x)) ds.(11)\nThe distance between any two diffeomorphisms is defined by\nd H (\u03c6 1 , \u03c6 2 ) 2 = d H (e, \u03c6 \u22121 1 \u2022 \u03c6 2 ) 2 .(12)\nThis distance satisfies all of the properties of a metric: it is non-negative, symmetric, and satisfies the triangle inequality [27]. Using this metric on H, we can define the distance between two images as\nd I (I 1 , I 2 ) 2 \u2261 min v:\u03c6s=vs(\u03c6s) 1 0 \u2126 Lv s (x) 2 dx ds + 1 \u03c3 2 \u2126 I 1 (\u03c6 \u22121 (x)) \u2212 I 2 (x) 2 dx (13\n)\nwhere the second term accounts for the noise model of the image [14]. While this construction is motivated by the metric on H, it does not strictly define Riemannian metric on the space of anatomical images (because of the second term). In the future we plan to define distance in terms of the elegant construction described in [33].\nHaving defined a metric on the space of images that accommodates anatomical variability, we can apply that metric to regress a representative anatomical configuration, with associated image, from our observations {t i , I i }\nI h (t) = argmin I\u2208I N i=1 K h (t \u2212 t i )d(I, I i ) 2 N i=1 K h (t \u2212 t i )\n.

This strategy has the dual benefits of (a) addressing the large scale shape changes first and (b) speeding algorithm convergence.\nThe dominating computation at each iteration is a Fast Fourier Transform. The order of the algorithm is M N n log n where M is the number of iterations, N is the number of images, and n is the number of voxels along the largest dimension of the images.
