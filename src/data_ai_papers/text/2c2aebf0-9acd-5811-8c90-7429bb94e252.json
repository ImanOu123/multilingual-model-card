In O 3 L, defaults have the following uniform representation in all cases:\nK\u03b1 \u2227 M\u03b2 \u2283 \u03b3.\n(1)\nHere K and M are modal operators in a first-order language, and the default may be read as \"if \u03b1 is believed and it is consistent to believe \u03b2, then conclude \u03b3.\" 1 To get the correspondence with DL, (1) is understood as the translation of the Reiter default rule \u03b1:\u03b2 \u03b3 . This translation was first proposed by Konolige (1988) in his attempt to map DL into AEL. That attempt failed essentially because AEL, including Konolige's variant, assumes that M is the dual of K, that is, that M\u03b2 \u2261 \u00acK\u00ac\u03b2 is valid, while DL requires this duality to be given up.\nO 3 L deals with each form of default reasoning using a variant of only-knowing, a notion which was originally introduced by Levesque (1990). The idea, roughly, is this: Consider a Reiter default theory \u03c6, D , where \u03c6 and D are finite sets of sentences (facts) and closed default rules, respectively, and let \u2206 be the translation of the defaults according to (1). Skeptical reasoning in DL, that is, the question as to whether a sentence \u03b1 is an element of all Reiter extensions, turns into the question as to whether the sentence\nO R (\u03c6 \u2227 \u2206) \u2283 K\u03b1 (2)\nis valid in O 3 L, that is, whether knowing \u03b1 follows logically from knowing only \u03c6 \u2227 \u2206. By varying the meaning of O R , the question can be modified into whether \u03b1 is an element of all Moore extensions 2 or all Konolige extensions. Technically, this is done by considering additional only-knowing operators O M and O K , for Moore and Konolige, respectively.\nA nice feature of O 3 L is its simple possible-world semantics using two sets of worlds (epistemic states), one for the interpretation of K and one for M. When considering the meaning of O M and O K , the two sets are always the same so that K and M are in fact duals as required by Moore and Konolige. It is only in the case of O R where the two sets differ and the duality no longer holds. Note also that O 3 L itself is a monotonic logic. In particular, the different forms of nonmonotonic reasoning are all expressed in terms of certain valid sentences of the logic such as (2).\nWith this in mind, one important question has remained open, namely what a proof theory for O 3 L would be like. This paper answers that question for the propositional subset of the language. There are at least two reasons why having a proof theory for O 3 L over and above a semantic account is useful. For one, it puts nonmonotonic inference back into the realm of proving theorems in the classical sense rather than having to resort to meta-logical arguments involving extensions, set intersections, or fixed points. For another, axiom systems in general provide a compact representation of the valid sentences of a logic, which often sheds new light on its properties. And indeed, as we will see below, the axiomatization of O R and hence of Reiter's DL turns out to be surprisingly simple once the axioms and inference rules for O M and O K are in place. Thus the connections among the approaches of Reiter, Moore and Konolige are further illuminated.\nWhy do we limit ourselves to the propositional subset? First of all, Halpern and Lakemeyer (1995) already proved the incompleteness of Levesque's original axiomatization of only-knowing, which is a proper subset of O 3 L. And, as we will argue at the end of the paper, even when O 3 L is restricted to the simplest forms of first-order default reasoning, it is unlikely that a complete axiom system exists. So we settle for the propositional case. For the sake of simplicity, we further limit the language so that it just covers the translations of Reiter default theories, the main concern from an AI perspective.\nBefore O 3 L, there have been a number of proposals showing how DL can be embedded faithfully in a modal epistemic logic such as (Lin and Shoham 1988;Lifschitz 1994;Amati et al. 1997;Denecker et al. 2003). However, in contrast to O 3 L, these approaches require either that AEL defaults be represented differently from DL defaults or a very complex semantics using certain fixed-point constructions.\nAs already mentioned, Levesque (1990) \nconsidered a sub- set of O 3 L called OL, which is essentially O 3 L minus the operators O K and O R .\nLevesque provided a sound and complete proof theory for the propositional subset of OL, which we will reuse here. Other notions of only-knowing were considered in (Levesque and Lakemeyer 2001;Halpern and Lakemeyer 2001;Waaler 2004), but in terms of nonmonotonic reasoning they did not go beyond AEL. There have been proof-theoretic characterizations of DL such as (Bonatti and Olivetti 1997). However, in contrast to our work, these require nonmonotonic inference rules.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the formal details of the logic O 3 L, its syntax and semantics. Then we turn our attention to an axiom system for the propositional subset of O 3 L, followed by some example derivations. After that we briefly examine the first order case and conclude.", "publication_ref": ["b17", "b22", "b15", "b22", "b15", "b18", "b20", "b11", "b12", "b18", "b19", "b13", "b23"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Syntax and semantics", "text": "The symbols of the O 3 L language are the usual logical connectives, quantifiers, punctuation, variables, the equality symbol, predicates (of every arity), a countably infinite set of standard names, and the modal operators M, K, O M , O K , and O R . For simplicity, constants and function symbols are omitted. 3 The terms of O 3 L are the variables and standard names. The formulas of O 3 L are defined by the following:\n1. if t 1 , . . . , t k are terms and P is a predicate of arity k, then P (t 1 , . . . , t k ) is an (atomic) formula;\n2. if t 1 and t 2 are terms, then (t 1 = t 2 ) is a formula; As usual, we treat (\u03b1 \u2228 \u03b2), (\u03b1 \u2283 \u03b2), (\u03b1 \u2261 \u03b2), and \u2203x.\u03b1 as abbreviations. The notion of a free and bound variable is defined in the usual way, and \u03b1 x n means \u03b1 with all free occurrences of x replaced by n. Similarly, we write \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b3 to mean \u03b1 with all occurrences of the subformula \u03b2 replaced by \u03b3. A formula without free variables is called a sentence, and a formula of the form P (n 1 , . . . , n k ), where the n i are standard names, a primitive sentence. Formulas without modal operators are called objective, and those where all the predicates appear in the scope of a modal operator are called subjective. Formulas without O M , O K and O R are called basic. To simplify our axiomatization, we require that the operators O M , O K and O R apply only to basic sentences where K and M do not occur nested. Note that this restriction still allows us to cover translations of default theories as discussed in the introduction.\nThe semantics of O 3 L builds on the semantics of OL from (Levesque and Lakemeyer 2001). The starting point is the notion of a world (or world state) which is a function from the primitive sentences to {0, 1}. We let W be the set of all worlds. An epistemic state in OL is any set of worlds. What is different in O 3 L is that two epistemic states are used, one to interpret formulas with K, and one to interpret formulas with M (since, as we noted, there will be contexts where the two operators are not duals).\nLet w be a world, and e 1 and e 2 be epistemic states. We can define when a basic sentence \u03b1 is true wrt e 1 , e 2 , and w, which we write as e 1 , e 2 , w |= \u03b1, as follows: where O K uses the e for its second epistemic argument (thus keeping the two arguments identical), O R uses the given e 2 .\n1. e 1 , e 2 , w |= P (n 1 , . . . , n k ) iff w[P (n 1 , . . . , n k )] = 1; 2. e 1 , e 2 , w |= (n 1 = n 2 ) iff n 1\nTo complete the specification of the logic, we define e, w |= \u03b1 to mean e, e, w |= \u03b1, and we say that a sentence \u03b1 is valid (which we write as |= \u03b1) iff e, w |= \u03b1 for every e and w. If \u03b1 is objective, we often omit the e and write w |= \u03b1; if \u03b1 is subjective, we write e |= \u03b1 or e 1 , e 2 |= \u03b1.\nVarious properties of O 3 L were discussed in (Lakemeyer and Levesque 2005) which we will not repeat here. We remark that the rule for O R was slightly different there, namely 10 e 1 , e 2 , w |= O R \u03b1 iff for every e such that e 1 \u2286 e , e , e 1 , w\n|= O M \u03b1 iff e = e 1 ,\nthat is, e 2 did not appear on the R.H.S. It is easy to verify that the logic remains the same given the fact that validity is defined with respect to identical e 1 and e 2 , and the restriction that O R does not occur nested. Now we turn to the axiomatization of the propositional subset of the language.", "publication_ref": ["b0", "b19", "b17"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "An Axiom System", "text": "We begin with an axiomatic characterization of O M , which was originally proposed in (Levesque 1990). For this purpose, it is convenient to consider O M not as a primitive notion but to define it in terms of K and yet another modal operator N. One way to read O M \u03b1 is to say that \u03b1 is believed and nothing more, whereas K\u03b1 says that \u03b1 is believed, and perhaps more. In other words, K\u03b1 means that \u03b1 at least is believed to be true. A natural dual to this is to say that \u03b1 at most is believed to be false, which we write N\u03b1. The idea is that O M \u03b1 would then be definable as (K\u03b1 \u2227 N\u00ac\u03b1), that is, at least \u03b1 is believed and at most \u03b1 is believed. So, exactly \u03b1 is believed. In other words, we are taking K to specify a lower bound on what is believed (since there may be other beliefs) and N to specify an upper bound on beliefs (since there may be fewer beliefs).\nThese bounds can be seen most clearly when talking about objective sentences. Given an epistemic state as specified by a set of world states e, to say that K\u03c6 is true wrt e is to say that e is a subset of the states where \u03c6 is true. By symmetry then, N\u00ac\u03c6 will be true when the set of states satisfying \u03c6 are a subset of e. The fact that e must contain all of these states means that nothing else can be believed that would eliminate any of them. This is the sense in which no more than \u03c6 is known. Finally, as before, O M \u03c6 is true iff both conditions hold and the two sets coincide.\nThis leads us to the precise definition of N\u03b1: e 1 , e 2 , w |= N\u03b1 iff for every w , if e 1 , e 2 , w | = \u03b1 then w \u2208 e 1 .\nOn closer inspection, it turns out that N behaves just like an ordinary belief operator (like K). This is most clearly seen by rephrasing very slightly the definition of N. Let e 1 stand for the set of worlds not in e 1 . e 1 , e 2 , w |= N\u03b1 iff for every w \u2208 e 1 , e 1 , e 2 , w |= \u03b1.\nWe are now ready to present an axiomatization:\nAxioms:\n1. The axioms of propositional logic 2. The axioms for K, N, and M: Let L stand for both K and N. (a) L\u03b1, where \u03b1 is an instance of an axiom (1) \n(b) L(\u03b1 \u2283 \u03b2) \u2283 L\u03b1 \u2283 L\u03b2 (c) \u03c3 \u2283 L\u03c3,\nO M \u03c6 1 \u2283 O M \u03b1, O M \u03c6 2 \u2283 O M \u03b1, O M \u03c6 1 \u2283 K\u03c6 2 , and O M \u03c6 2 \u2283 \u00acK\u03c6 1 , derive K\u03c6 1 \u2283 \u00acO K \u03b1. (b) From O M \u03b1 \u2283 O M \u03c8 \u2228 O M \u03c6 i , O M \u03c8 \u2283 O M \u03b1, and O M \u03c8 \u2283 \u00acK\u03c6 i , derive O M \u03c8 \u2283 O K \u03b1.\nLet us review this proof theory. Axiom (1) and Rule (1) give us classical propositional logic. When we add Axioms (2), we get that K and N behave exactly like operators in the modal logic K45 (Chellas 1980). Moreover, because of (2c), they are mutually introspective. Axiom (2d) makes M the dual of K but does not mean that M can be replaced everywhere by \u00acK\u00ac. In particular, the replacement will not be sanctioned within O R .\nWhen we add the Axioms (3), we get that O M behaves just like the O operator in (Levesque 1990). Note that Axiom (3b) appeals to satisfiability in classical propositional logic. This could be axiomatized separately, but we do not do so here. This dependence on satisfiability means that the set of instances of this axiom in a first-order setting would not be recursively enumerable. This is unfortunately how it must be, however, since the valid sentences are not recursively enumerable either. This is the price we pay for trying to formalize a notion of default reasoning that is \"consistencybased\" like Reiter's DL.\nSo far, the axioms and rules are all in (Levesque 1990) (modulo M, which was not used there). The new material concerns O K and O R . Turning to O R first, there are three axioms which taken together characterize O R in terms of O K in an inductive fashion. Axiom (4a) says that O R reduces to O K if M is not mentioned anywhere. Axiom (4b) and (4c) show how O R \u03b1 reduces to a case with fewer occurrences of M. In essence, this allows us to remove subformulas M\u03c6 from \u03b1 one by one until they are all gone, and then applying Axiom (4a) to obtain the reduction to O K . The Axioms (4) show very clearly the difference between Konolige and Reiter: while Konolige extensions are the result of a global minimization policy with respect to all Moore extensions (as we will see below), Reiter extensions are obtained by first fixing the assignment to the M-sub-formulas and then applying Konolige-style minimization.\nFinally, we get to O K , which requires Axiom (5) and Rules (2a) and (2b). To understand what these are doing, it is useful to recall a result from (Levesque and Lakemeyer 2001):\nTheorem 1: [Levesque and Lakemeyer] Let \u03b1 be a basic sentence without quantifiers. Then there is a set of objective sentences \u03a6 = {\u03c6 1 , . . . , \u03c6 n } such that\n|= O M \u03b1 \u2261 (O M \u03c6 1 \u2228 . . . \u2228 O M \u03c6 n ).\nIn other words, the set \u03a6 characterizes precisely the Moore extensions of \u03b1. Konolige extensions correspond to those \u03c6 i \u2208 \u03a6, which have the additional property (*) that there is no \u03c6 j \u2208 \u03a6 such that \u03c6 i classically entails \u03c6 j but not vice versa. With this in mind, Axiom ( 5) makes sure that all Konolige extensions are Moore extensions, Rule (2a) eliminates those that violate (*), and Rule (2b) ensures that those that satisfy (*) are included. Now we turn to the main technical results of the paper, the soundness and completeness of the axioms. To prove soundness, we need the following lemma: Theorem 2: The axiom system presented above is sound for propositional O 3 L.", "publication_ref": ["b18", "b18", "b18", "b1", "b19"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Proof:", "text": "The proof is not very difficult. Here we show the soundness of the Axioms (4). The soundness of Axiom (4a)  The proof of completeness is much more challenging.\nTheorem 3: The axiom system presented above is complete for propositional O 3 L.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Proof:", "text": "(Sketch) The proof is adapted from the completeness proof for the logic OL in (Levesque and Lakemeyer 2001), which first appeared in (Halpern and Lakemeyer 1995). The idea is roughly this: First, we introduce a slight variant of the semantics of O 3 L, where N is not interpreted with respect to e but with respect to a set e N , which together with e covers all worlds, yet may overlap with e.\nThen we show that (a) this semantics satisfies all the axioms and (b) a sentence is satisfiable in O 3 L iff it is satisfiable under the new semantics (using a construction similar to the proof of Theorem 10.3.5 in (Levesque and Lakemeyer 2001)). The completeness proof is carried out with respect to the new semantics using a Henkin-style argument over maximal consistent sets (similar to the proof of Theorem 10.3.8 in (Levesque and Lakemeyer 2001)).", "publication_ref": ["b19", "b19", "b19"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Some sample derivations", "text": "Before we turn to derivations of some nonmonotonicreasoning examples, recall that O K \u03b1 \u2283 O M \u03b1 is an axiom. Its counterpart, using O R instead of O K , is provable too, and will be used later.\nTheorem 4: O R \u03b1 \u2283 O M \u03b1 is a theorem.\nThis follows from Theorem 3 of (Lakemeyer and Levesque 2005) and the completeness theorem above.\nExample 1: Tweety and Chilly. The objective facts are that Tweety and Chilly are birds, Chilly does not fly (self-propelled through the air, that is), but Tweety's flying status is left unspecified (somewhat surprisingly, after all this time). The default information is that birds typically fly, which we need to instantiate for the two individuals. Thus we have:\nKB = { Bird(tw), Bird(ch), \u00acFly(ch) } \u2206 = KBird(tw) \u2227 MFly(tw) \u2283 Fly(tw) KBird(ch) \u2227 MFly(ch) \u2283 Fly(ch)\nWe want to consider what logically follows from only knowing KB and \u2206. We will show formal derivations in our axiom system that prove that Fly(tw) is an element of every Moore, Konolige, and Reiter extension. First, Moore. To derive K\u00acFly(ch) from O M (KB \u2227 \u2206) is easy: we use Axiom (3a) to get K(KB \u2227 \u2206), then apply ordinary modal K45 reasoning to do the rest (ignoring \u2206). For Tweety, to derive KFly(tw), we again use (3a) to get K(KB \u2227 \u2206), then apply ordinary modal K45 to get to (KFly(tw) \u2228 K\u00acFly(tw)) (*), but this is not enough. To go further, we apply Axiom (3a) to get N\u00ac(KB \u2227 \u2206), and then ordinary modal K45 reasoning to get N(KB \u2283 \u00acFly(tw)), using the fact that NK\u00acFly(ch) is derivable by mutual introspection. Since KB |= \u00acFly(tw), we get to use the Axiom (3b), to derive \u00acK(KB \u2283 \u00acFly(tw)), and then, using modal K45 reasoning, \u00acK\u00acFly(tw). Combining this with (*), we get the desired conclusion.\nWe can put all this in a natural-deduction style proof annotated with justifications for each step. Here PL and K45 refer respectively to reasoning using the propositional logic and K45 (for K and N, including mutual introspection).\nProof: To prove that (O M (KB \u2227 \u2206) \u2283 KFly(tw)) is a theorem, we proceed as follows:\n1. O M (KB \u2227 \u2206)\nAssumption. Konolige is next. To derive K\u00acFly(ch) and KFly(tw) from O K (KB \u2227 \u2206) is now easy: we use the previous derivation together with Axiom ( 5", "publication_ref": ["b17"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "K(KB", "text": "): O K \u03b1 \u2283 O M \u03b1.\nFinally, we turn to Reiter and DL. To derive K\u00acFly(ch) and KFly(tw) from O R (KB \u2227 \u2206), we proceed as with Konolige, but this time using Theorem 4. Strictly speaking, then, a derivation of KFly(tw) would need the above derivation and another generic one corresponding to Theorem 4.\nExample 2: O K (Kp \u2283 p) \u2283 \u00acKp is a theorem. The sentence \u03b1 = (Kp \u2283 p) is perhaps the simplest that demonstrates the difference between Moore and Konolige. While \u03b1 has two Moore extensions, one containing p and another containing only tautologies, Konolige rules out the former, and so in every Konolige extension, p is not known. 4\nProof: As a corollary we obtain that O R \u03b1 \u2283 \u00acKp is a theorem as well because of Axiom (4a).  Indeed, (Levesque and Lakemeyer 2001) contains a number of example derivations for various first-order default theories encoded in OL. As the following example suggests, however, this seems unlikely to work in general, even in the simplest of all cases: prerequisite-free normal defaults. and \u2206 be the quantified default \u2200x.MP (x) \u2283 P (x). Then \u00acO M (\u03c6 \u2227 \u2206) is valid. In other words, this default theory has no Moore extensions and, therefore, no Konolige or Reiter extensions either. This is somewhat surprising since all normal theories have Reiter extensions in the usual (propositional) setting. Intuitively, the reason why \u00acO M (\u03c6\u2227\u2206) is valid is this: according to the default \u2206, everything by default is a P . But \u03c6 forces there to be an infinite number of unnamed exceptions (individuals that are not P ), using an auxiliary relation R that is irreflexive and transitive. Extensions (for Reiter, Moore, and Konolige) require a minimal set of exceptions. However there is no such thing as a minimal infinite set of exceptions.\n1. O M p \u2283 O M \u03b1 OL. 2. O M true \u2283 O M \u03b1 OL. 3. O M p \u2283 Ktrue OL. 4. O M true \u2283 \u00acKp OL. 5. O M p \u2283 \u00acO K \u03b1 1,\nNote also that, if we were to replace \u03c6 by any other sentence \u03c6 , which admits a finite number of exceptions, then O M (\u03c6 \u2227 \u2206) would be satisfiable.\nOne might wonder perhaps whether the problem has to do with O 3 L's particular approach to using standard names as the domain of discourse. As far as we know, there are essentially only two other approaches that deal with default reasoning in a modal setting with quantifying-in, (Lifschitz 1994) and (Kaminski and Rey 2002), which elaborates on earlier work by Konolige (1991). While Lifschitz uses a variant of the standard-name idea, Kaminski and Rey employ special Herbrand models. In both cases it is not hard to show that they obtain the same results regarding Example 4, when rephrased in the respective formalism.\nThus, while we do not have a proof, we surmise that we will not be able to distinguish between the finite and infinite cases using a first-order proof theory, and therefore not be able to derive \u00acO M (\u03c6 \u2227 \u2206). Perhaps the best that can be hoped for is a proof theory that is incomplete but sufficient for many applications. Indeed the proof theory proposed by Levesque handles many of the standard examples, where only finite sets of exceptions are ever contemplated.", "publication_ref": ["b19", "b20", "b14", "b16"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper we proposed an axiom system for the propositional fragment of the logic O 3 L. Among other things, O 3 L captures skeptical reasoning in Reiter's default logic in terms of certain valid sentences of the logic. With the axiomatization, it is now possible, perhaps for the first time, to give purely deductive proofs of default inferences. The axioms themselves are also interesting in that default logic requires only a single axiom scheme in addition to those defining Moore's autoepistemic logic and Konolige's variant.\nThe axioms and rules, however, are cumbersome to use. We leave for future work the task of reformulating them in a more manageable way.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "First-order defaults", "text": "The work of Moore and Konolige is purely propositional, and so the proof theory of O 3 L as it stands correctly captures those systems. Reiter's DL, on the other hand, is first-order, although it uses defaults in a limited way. For example, using an open default such as Bird(x) : Fly(x) Fly(x) one can conclude by default that a bird will fly, but one does not conclude by default that all birds fly. So the variable x in the default is actually just a place holder for arbitrary ground terms. In this sense, Reiter does not really have quantified defaults, but rather sets of ground defaults, which again the proof theory of O 3 L can capture.\nHowever, as noted in (Lakemeyer and Levesque 2005), we do have the additional possibility in O 3 L of actual quantified defaults, which raises the question as to whether we can provide an axiom system for them as well. As already noted, this appears to be unlikely, even if we restrict ourselves to Levesque's logic OL, which is O 3 L without O K and O R . Initially, Levesque proposed an axiomatization, which consisted of our Axioms (1), ( 2) and ( 3), with (1) replaced by the axioms of first-order logic (plus some to deal with standard names) and the additional Barcan formula \u2200x.L\u03b1 \u2283 L\u2200x.\u03b1 where L can be either K or N. Later, Halpern and Lakemeyer (1995) proved that these axioms were incomplete by showing that the sentence N\u03b6 \u2283 \u00acK\u03b6 is not derivable for \u03b6 = [\u2203x.P (x) \u2227 \u00acKP (x)] \u2228 [\u2203x.\u00acP (x) \u2227 KP (x)]. The reason is, roughly, because the N vs K axiom (3b) is too weak when restricted to objective sentences. 5 ", "publication_ref": ["b17", "b1"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}], "references": [{"ref_id": "b0", "title": "", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": " \u00aco M P \u2283 \u00aco K"}, {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": "\u2283 \u00aco M P Ol"}, {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": "\u2283 \u00aco K \u0391 \u0393;  \u00aco R \u0391 \u0393 Ax"}, {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": " O M P \u2283 O M \u0391 \u0393 Ol"}, {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": " O M True \u2283 O M \u0391 \u0393 Ol"}, {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": "O L O M P \u2283 Ktrue"}, {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": "O L O M True \u2283 \u00ackp"}, {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": "\u2283 Kp;  \u00aco K \u0391 \u0393"}, {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "", "journal": "", "year": "", "authors": "Kp Ax"}, {"ref_id": "b9", "title": "", "journal": "\u2283 \u00acO R \u03b1", "year": "", "authors": ""}, {"ref_id": "b10", "title": "", "journal": "\u00acO R \u03b1 9", "year": "", "authors": ""}, {"ref_id": "b11", "title": "A sequent calculus for skeptical default logic", "journal": "Cambridge University Press", "year": "1980", "authors": "G Amati; L C Aiello; F A Pirri ; P; N Bonatti;  Olivetti"}, {"ref_id": "b12", "title": "Uniform semantic treatment of default and autoepistemic logic", "journal": "Artificial Intelligence", "year": "1995", "authors": "M Denecker; V W Marek; M Truszczynski"}, {"ref_id": "b13", "title": "Multi-Agent Only Knowing", "journal": "Journal of Logic and Computation", "year": "2001", "authors": "J Y Halpern; G Lakemeyer"}, {"ref_id": "b14", "title": "Revisiting quantification in autoepistemic logic", "journal": "ACM Transactions on Computational Logic", "year": "2002", "authors": "M Kaminski; G Rey"}, {"ref_id": "b15", "title": "On the relation between default logic and autoepistemic theories", "journal": "Artificial Intelligence", "year": "1988", "authors": "K Konolige"}, {"ref_id": "b16", "title": "Quantification in autoepistemic logic.
