The connectionist models use a distributed representation of the items in the history and make much better use of contexts than currently used interpolated or back-off models, not only because of the inherent capability of the connectionist model in fighting the data sparseness problem, but also because of the sublinear growth in the model size when the context length is increased. The connectionist models can be further trained by an EM procedure, similar to the previously used procedure for training the SLM. Our experiments show that the connectionist models can significantly improve the PPL over the interpolated and back-off models on the UPENN Treebank corpora, after interpolating with a baseline trigram language model. The EM training procedure can improve the connectionist models further, by using hidden events obtained by the SLM parser.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In many systems dealing with natural speech or language such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Statistical Machine Translation, a language model is a crucial component for searching in the often prohibitively large hypothesis space. Most of the state-of-the-art systems use n-gram language models, which are simple and effective most of the time. Many smoothing techniques that improve language model probability estimation have been proposed and studied in the n-gram literature (Chen and Goodman, 1998).\nRecent efforts have studied various ways of using information from a longer context span than that usually captured by normal n-gram language models, as well as ways of using syntactical information that is not available to the word-based n-gram models (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000;Charniak, 2001;Roark, 2001;Uystel et al., 2001). All these language models are based on stochastic parsing techniques that build up parse trees for the input word sequence and condition the generation of words on syntactical and lexical information available in the parse trees. Since these language models capture useful hierarchical characteristics of language, they can improve the PPL significantly for various tasks. Although more improvement can be achieved by enriching the syntactical dependencies in the structured language model (SLM) (Xu et al., 2002), a severe data sparseness problem was observed in (Xu et al., 2002) when the number of conditioning features was increased.\nThere has been recent promising work in using distributional representation of words and neural networks for language modeling (Bengio et al., 2001) and parsing (Henderson, 2003). One great advantage of this approach is its ability to fight data sparseness. The model size grows only sub-linearly with the number of predicting features used. It has been shown that this method improves significantly on regular n-gram models in perplexity (Bengio et al., 2001). The ability of the method to accommodate longer contexts is most appealing, since experiments have shown consistent improvements in PPL when the context of one of the components of the SLM is increased in length (Emami et al., 2003). Moreover, because the SLM provides an EM training procedure for its components, the connectionist models can also be improved by the EM training.\nIn this paper, we will study the impact of neural network modeling on the SLM, when all of its three components are modeled with this approach. An EM training procedure will be outlined and applied to further training of the neural network models.", "publication_ref": ["b4", "b3", "b2", "b10", "b12", "b13", "b13", "b0", "b8", "b0", "b5"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "A Probabilistic Neural Network Model", "text": "Recently, a relatively new type of language model has been introduced where words are represented by points in a multi-dimensional feature space and the probability of a sequence of words is computed by means of a neural network. The neural network, having the feature vectors of the preceding words as its input, estimates the probability of the next word (Bengio et al., 2001). The main idea behind this model is to fight the curse of dimensionality by interpolating the seen sequences in the training data. The generalization this model aims at is to assign to an unseen word sequence a probability similar to that of a seen word sequence whose words are similar to those of the unseen word sequence. The similarity is defined as being close in the multi-dimensional space mentioned above.\nIn brief, this model can be described as follows. A feature vector is associated with each token in the input vocabulary, that is, the vocabulary of all the items that can be used for conditioning. Then the conditional probability of the next word is expressed as a function of the input feature vectors by means of a neural network. This probability is produced for every possible next word from the output vocabulary. In general, there does not need to be any relationship between the input and output vocabularies. The feature vectors and the parameters of the neural network are learned simultaneously during training. The input to the neural network are the feature vec-tors for all the inputs concatenated, and the output is the conditional probability distribution over the output vocabulary. The idea here is that the words which are close to each other (close in the sense of their role in predicting words to follow) would have similar (close) feature vectors and since the probability function is a smooth function of these feature values, a small change in the features should only lead to a small change in the probability.", "publication_ref": ["b0"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "The Architecture of the Neural Network Model", "text": "The conditional probability function\n\u00a2 \u00a1 \u00a4 \u00a3 \u00a6 \u00a5 \u00a7 \u00a6 \u00a9 \u00a7 \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a7 ! # \"\nwhere \u00a7 % $  ", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "& '", "text": ".

It is straightforward to compute the gradient of the likelihood function for the feature vectors and the neural network parameters, and hence compute their updates. We should note from equation 4 that the neural network model is similar in functional form to the maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996) except that the neural network learns the feature functions by itself from the training data. However, unlike the G/IIS algorithm for the maximum entropy model, the training algorithm (usually stochastic gradient descent) for the neural network models is not guaranteed to find even a local maximum of the objective function.\nIt is very important to mention that one of the great advantages of this model is that the number of inputs can be increased causing only sub-linear increase in the number of model parameters, as opposed to exponential growth in n-gram models.

The labels -the parse structure-are used to get the conditioning variables.

First, we used one discount constant for each n-gram level, instead of three different discount constants. Second, our discount constant was estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood of the heldout data (assuming the discount constant is between 0 and 1), instead of the Good-Turing estimate. Finally, in order to deal with the fractional counts we encounter during the EM training procedure, we developed an approximate Kneser-Ney smoothing for fractional counts. For lack of space, we do not go into the details of this approximation, but our approximation becomes the exact Kneser-Ney smoothing when the counts are integers.\nIn order to test our Kneser-Ney smoothing implementation, we built a trigram language model and compared the performance with that from the SRILM. Our PPL was 149.6 and the SRILM PPL was 148.3, therefore, although there are differences in the implementation details, we think our result is close enough to the SRILM.\nHaving tested the smoothing method, we applied it to the SLM. We used the Kneser-Ney smoothing to all components with the same parameterization as the h-2 scheme in (Xu et al., 2002). Table 1 is the comparison between the deleted-interpolation (DI) smoothing and the Kneser-Ney (KN) smoothing. The \u00a1 in Table 1 is the interpolation weight between the SLM and the trigram language model (\u00a1 =1.0 being the trigram language model). The notation \"En\" indicates the models were obtained after \"n\" iterations of EM training 1 . Since Kneser-Ney smoothing is consistently better than deletedinterpolation, we later on report only the Kneser-Ney smoothing results when comparing to the neural network models. ", "publication_ref": ["b9", "b6", "b11", "b13"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Training Neural Network Models with the Treebank", "text": "We used the neural network models for all of the three components of the SLM. The neural network models are exactly as described in Section 2.1. Since the inputs to the networks are always a mixture of words and NT/POS tags, while the output probabilities are over words in the PREDICTOR, POS tags in the TAGGER, and adjoint actions in the PARSER, we used separate input and output vocabularies in all cases. In all of our experiments with the neural network models, we used 30 dimensional feature vectors as input encoding of the mixed items, 100 hidden units and a starting learning rate of 0.001. Stochastic gradient descent was used for training the models for a maximum of 50 iterations. The initialization for the parameters is done randomly with a uniform distribution centered at zero. In order to study the behavior of the SLM when longer context is used for conditioning the probabilities, we gradually increased the context of the PREDICTOR model. First, the third exposed previous head was added. Since the syntactical head gets the head word from one of the children, either left or right, the child that does not contain the head word (hence called opposite child) is never used later on in predicting. This is particularly not appropriate for the prepositional phrase because the preposition is always the head word of the phrase in the UPenn Treebank annotation. Therefore, we also added the opposite child of the first exposed previous head into the context for predicting. Both Kneser-Ney smoothing and the neural network model were studied when the context was gradually increased. The results are shown in Table 2.\nIn Table 2, \"nH\" stands for \"n\" exposed previous heads are used for conditioning in the PREDICTOR component, \"nOP\" stands for \"n\" opposite children are used, starting from the most recent one. As we can see, when the length of the context is increased, Another interesting result is that it seems the neural network model can learn a probability distribution that is less correlated to the normal trigram model. Although before interpolating with the trigram, the PPL results of the neural network models are not as good as the Kneser-Ney smoothed models, they become much better when combined with the trigram. In the results of Table 2, the trigram model is a Kneser-Ney smoothed model that gave PPL of 149.6 by itself. The interpolation weight with the trigram is 0.4 and 0.5 respectively, for the Kneser-Ney smoothed SLM and neural network based SLM.    3 shows the ratio between the test PPL and train PPL. We can see that for the neural network models, the ratios are much smaller than that for the Kneser-Ney smoothed models. Furthermore, as the length of context increases, the ratio for the Kneser-Ney smoothed model becomes greater -a clear sign of over-parameterization. However, the ratio for the neural network model changes very little even when the length of the context increases from 4 (2H) to 8 (3H-1OP). The exact reason why the neural network models are more uncorrelated to the trigram is not completely understood, but we conjecture that part of the reason is that the neural network models can learn a probability distribution very different from the trigram by putting much less probability mass on the training examples.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_11"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Training the Neural Network Models with EM", "text": "After the neural network models were trained from the labeled data -the UPenn Treebank-we performed one iteration of the EM procedure described in Section 4.   (Xu et al., 2002) where deleted-interpolation smoothing was used for the SLM components. It is worth noting that the approximated Kneser-Ney smoothed models could not improve the PPL after one iteration of EM training. One possible reason is that in order to apply Kneser-Ney smoothing to fractional counts, we had to approximate the discounting. The approximation may degrade the benefit we could have gotten from the EM training. Similarly, the M step in the EM procedure for the neural network models also has the same problem: the stochastic gradient descent algorithm is not guaranteed to converge. This can be clearly seen in Figure 4 in which we plot the learning curves of the 3H-1OP model (PREDICTOR component) on both training and heldout data at EM iteration 0 and iteration 1. For EM iteration 0, because we started from parameters drawn from a uniform distribution, we only plot the last 30 iterations of the stochastic gradient descent. As we expected, the learning curve of the training data in EM iteration 1 is not as smooth as that in EM iteration 0, and even more so for the heldout data. However, the general trend is still decreasing. Although we can not prove that the EM training of the neural network models via the SLM can improve the PPL, we observed experimentally a gain that is favorable comparing to that from the usual Kneser-Ney smoothed models or deleted interpolation models.", "publication_ref": ["b13"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Conclusion and Future Work", "text": "By using connectionist models in the SLM, we achieved significant improvement in PPL over the baseline trigram and SLM. The neural network enhenced SLM resulted in a language model that is much less correlated with the baseline Kneser-Ney smoothed trigram than the Kneser-Ney smoothed SLM. Overall, the best studied model gave a 21% relative reduction in PPL over the trigram and 8.7% relative reduction over the corresponding Kneser-Ney smoothed SLM. A new EM training procedure improved the performance of the SLM even further when applied to the neural network models.\nHowever, reduction in PPL for a language model does not always mean improvement in performance of a real application such as speech recognition. Therefore, future study on applying the neural network enhenced SLM to real applications needs to be carried out. A preliminary study in (Emami et al., 2003) already showed that this approach is promising in reducing the word error rate of a large vocabulary speech recognizer.\nThere are still many interesting problems in applying the neural network enhenced SLM to real applications. Among those, we think the following are of most of interest:\nSpeeding up the stochastic gradient descent algorithm for neural network training: Since training the neural network models is very time-consuming, it is essential to speed up the training in order to carry out many more interesting experiments.\nInterpreting the word representations learned in this framework: For example, word clustering, context clustering, etc. In particular, if we use separate mapping matrices for word/NT/POS at different positions in the context, we may be able to learn very different representations of the same word/NT/POS.
