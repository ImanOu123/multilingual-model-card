{"title": "Predicting human similarity judgments with distributional models: The value of word associations", "authors": "Simon De Deyne; Amy Perfors; Daniel J Navarro", "pub_date": "", "abstract": "Most distributional lexico-semantic models derive their representations based on external language resources such as text corpora. In this study, we propose that internal language models, that are more closely aligned to the mental representations of words could provide important insights into cognitive science, including linguistics. Doing so allows us to reflect upon theoretical questions regarding the structure of the mental lexicon, and also puts into perspective a number of assumptions underlying recently proposed distributional text-based models. In particular, we focus on word-embedding models which have been proposed to learn aspects of word meaning in a manner similar to humans. These are contrasted with internal language models derived from a new extensive data set of word associations. Using relatedness and similarity judgments we evaluate these models and find that the word-association-based internal language models consistently outperform current state-of-the art text-based external language models, often with a large margin. These results are not just a performance improvement; they also have implications for our understanding of how distributional knowledge is used by people.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "How is semantic information encoded? How is similarity represented in the brain? And how can we capture this information computationally? One answer to this question involves distributional lexicosemantic models, which quantify the semantic similarity between lexical items based on their distributional properties in large samples of data. Recent models like word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014), which rely on external corpora as the source of data, increasingly appear to capture word meaning in ways that ever-more-closely resemble human representations. For instance, these models show systematic improvements over previous work in key benchmarks such as human similarity judgments of word pairs (Baroni et al., 2014). The strong performance of these models has also suggested to cognitive scientists that the learning mechanisms they embody might resemble how humans learn the meaning of some words (Mandera et al., in press).\nIn this study we show that using word-association data instead of corpus data improves performance substantially above the current state-of-the-art. We suggest that this is because data-intensive distributional models like word2vec, formidable though they are, may not capture word representations the way the average adult language speaker does. Their enormous, high-quality input data enables them to mimic human behavior, but they do relatively poorly compared to performance based on data that more accurately captures people's true representations of meaning.\nThe distinction between using text corpora or word association data maps onto the distinction made by Taylor (2012) between External language models (E-language) and Internal language models (Ilanguage). An E-language model, like word2vec, treats language as an \"external\" object consisting of the all utterances made in a speech-community. An I-language model sees language as the body of knowledge residing in the brains of its speakers. Largely due to the easy availability of high-quality external corpora -for instance, there are over one trillion words in the Google n-gram corpus (Michel et al., 2011) -computational linguists have traditionally focused on E-language models (Bullinaria and Levy, 2007;Baroni et al., 2014;Levy et al., 2015). Whether a similar distributional approach based on I-language might also be useful has received relatively less attention. One explanation could be purely on the basis of practical arguments, as it's not clear whether appropriate I-language resources are available. This paper fills that gap, by introducing an approximation of I-language using a new database of word associations considerably larger than previous ones and conducting a direct comparison of how both kinds of approaches predict human similarity judgments. It is valuable not just in demonstrating that models based on I-language greatly improve their performance. It also suggests that when people judge similarity, they may be relying more on networks of semantic associations than on statistics calculated from the distributional patterns of the words they hear.\nWhy should we expect to see (and why do we see) such improvements when the models use word associations data rather than high-quality large-scale text corpora data? After all, word association models generally incorporate far less data. Moreover, one might presume that word associations are themselves simply derived from the distribution of words in the external language: in that case, one would expect them to be an inferior and noisy measure.\nHowever, several strands of research support the idea that word associations capture representations that cannot be fully reduced to the distributional properties of the E-language environment. Previous attempts to predict word associations from E-language have had limited success (Griffiths et al., 2007;Michelbacher et al., 2007;Wettler et al., 2005). E-language typically only predicts the strongest associate in the minority of cases and does even worse in predicting non-primary responses. Why is this? At least part of it is that E-language has the structure it does because people are using it to communicate to each other; it is not simply a reflection of their mental representations. For instance, the word \"yellow\" is a very strong associate of \"banana\", but the two words co-occur relatively infrequently since most bananas are yellow. As a result, modifying the word banana with yellow is uninformative, so most people leave it out when talking. Many of the divergences between the distributions of words in external language and the strength of internal associations may occur because so much of E-language is shaped by pragmatic and communicative considerations such as these. There is also evidence that meaning representations in the brain, as reflected in word associations, are shaped by far more than the distributional properties of the E-language. For instance, fMRI measures reveal that imagery-related areas like the precuneus are activated during word association tasks (Simmons et al., 2008).\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Part 2 we describe the origin and nature of the data we are using as the E-language source (text corpora) and I-language source (word association data). Part 3 describes the distributional models which we will apply to each data source, while Part 4 describes the multiple human similarity and relatedness judgments that each model and data source will be used to predict. Part 5, the results, demonstrates that models based on I-language consistently perform substantially better than the same model based on E-language.\n2 Data sources\nThe central comparison in this paper is between model performance on E-language vs I-language data. The increasing number of online resources from which text can be extracted means that obtaining a representative E-language has become more straightforward. Furthermore, better balanced corpora that easily surpass the knowledge of the average human are readily available. We derived our E-language data based on four different kinds of existing text-based corpora, as described below.\nFree word association data are used as the I-language data. Although there are certainly other possibilities, word association data are advantageous as they appear to tap directly into mental representations (Deese, 1965;McRae et al., 2012;Szalay and Deese, 1978). Moreover, we shall show that a new procedure and larger data sets address important shortcomings from previous work that relied on a relatively small number of cues words for which only a single association response was asked from the participant (Kiss et al., 1973;Nelson et al., 2004).", "publication_ref": ["b27", "b30", "b2", "b36", "b25", "b5", "b2", "b22", "b12", "b26", "b38", "b34", "b11", "b24", "b35", "b18", "b28"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "A text corpus to train E-language models", "text": "Our aim was to combine corpora that would provide us with a fairly balanced set of texts that is representative of the sort of language a person experiences during a lifetime -including both formal and informal language as well as spoken and written language. Four different corpora were combined.\n1. Subtitles for English movies between 1970 and 2016 extracted from the OpenSubtitle corpus as described in Tiedemann (2012). Subtitle corpora have been frequently used in cognitive science because they capture daily language better than extremely large written corpora like the Google n-gram corpus (Brysbaert et al., 2011).\n2. The Corpus of Contemporary English (COCA), as described in Davies (1990 present). It consists of a balanced set of formal and informal language including fiction, newspaper articles and spoken texts. We excluded the sub-corpus for academic texts.\n3. The Global Web-Based English corpus (GlowBE), as described in Davies (2013). We included the sub-corpora of British, American, Canadian and Australian texts.\n4. SimpleWiki, which presents knowledge that is likely available to the average person (18 million tokens in comparison to the 2.9 billion words in the full English Wikipedia).\nAltogether, in compiling these corpora we aimed to be generous in terms of the quality and quantity of items so that models incorporating it would perform similarly to the existing state-of-the-art. For similar reasons, we used word-forms rather than lemmas: this matches previous work and provides the best possible match with the stimuli in the human benchmarks. The resulting corpus consisted of 2.16 billion tokens and 4.17 million types. Each sentence was uncased and stop words were removed. We further excluded words that did not occur at least 300 times, retaining 65,632 unique word types. This cut-off is larger than previous approaches using count models and word embedding models but allowed us to reduce the memory requirements for the count model we introduce later and to make sure that words in the evaluation sets were at least as frequent as the words in the association study for which we collected 300 responses. Moreover, we piloted different cut-offs and found it didn't affect our findings.", "publication_ref": ["b37", "b4", "b8"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "A novel word association dataset for I-language models", "text": "One of the shortcomings with previous word association studies of considerable size like the Edinburgh Association Thesaurus (Kiss et al., 1973) or the University of South Florida norms (Nelson et al., 2004) is that they only include the strongest associations (Aitchison, 2012) because only a single response is generated for each cue word. For example, in the case of umbrella, most participants would respond rain, which prevents the inclusion of weaker links. A better way to include weaker associates as well is by using a continued procedure where multiple responses for each cue word were collected (Szalay and Deese, 1978). Extending the response set to include weaker responses and including enough cue words to capture most words used in daily languages motivated us to set up a new large-scale study. The current data are collected as part of the Small World of Words project, an ongoing effort to map the mental lexicon in various languages 1 . Each participant was given a short list of cue words (between 15 and 20 words) and asked to generate three different responses to each cue. To avoid chaining responses, the instructions stressed to only give a response to the cue word. If a word was unknown or no secondary or tertiary response could be given, the participants were able to indicate this. Additional details on the procedure are available in (De Deyne et al., 2013).\nThe results reported here are based on 10,021 cue words for which at least 300 responses have been collected (100 primary, 100 secondary and 100 tertiary) for every cue. The study was presented as an online crowd sourced project in which fluent English speakers volunteered to participate. The responses were based on over 85,496 participants of which 82% were native speakers. Responses indicated as unknown (1.17% of cue words) or missing, because a participant could not think of any secondary or tertiary associations (4.15% of responses), were excluded. In line with previous work, we constructed a semantic graph from these data. This graph closely resembles the bag-of-words count models but represented as a graph makes it possible to consider the spreading activation discussed in the next section. A graph G was constructed by only including responses that also occurred as a cue word. This converted the bimodal cue \u00d7 response graph to a unimodal cue \u00d7 response graph. In this weighted graph G, g ij counts the number of times that word j is given as an associate of word i. We extracted the largest strongly connected component by only keeping those cues that were also given at least once as a response. This way all words can be reached by both in-and out-going links. The resulting graph consists of 10,014 nodes, which retains 84% of the original data consisting of all responses. The average number of tokens per word is 267 and the number of different word types each word is connected to (i.e., its out-degree of) is 92, ranging from 12 (for the word done) to 169 (for control). As expected, the graph is also very sparse: only 0.92% of words are connected (i.e., G has 0.92% non-zero entries). Throughout the text we will refer to this graph as G 123 , since it incorporates all three responses given by participants.", "publication_ref": ["b18", "b28", "b1", "b35", "b9"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Models", "text": "We consider four different models in this paper, two E-language models estimated from the text corpora, and two I-language models that use word association data.

We focused on the word embeddings derived from the neural network approach in word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013;Levy et al., 2015), using a continuous bag of words (CBOW) architecture in which the model is given the surrounding context for a word (i.e., the other words in a sliding window) and is trained to predict that word.\nFor our analyses, we used the gensim implementation of word2vec (\u0158eh\u016f\u0159ek and Sojka, 2010). Based on previous work (Baroni et al., 2014;Mandera et al., in press) the following settings were used: a negative sampling value of 10, and a down-sampling rate of very frequent terms of 1e-5. Additionally, the following hyper-parameters were manipulated, using the values reported by previous work (Levy et al., 2015) as a starting point. We considered window sizes between 2 to 10, and fitted models with between 100 and 500 dimensions with steps of 100. We will focus on the best fitting hyper-parameter values, but for the purposes of robustness we will also examine the performance of models using previously published semantic vectors.", "publication_ref": ["b27", "b22", "b2", "b22"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Count based model for word associations", "text": "In an E-language model, the goal is to characterize the linguistic contents of a text corpus, whereas an I-language model aims to capture the mental representation that a human speaker might employ. The difference between these two goals motivates a difference in the kinds of data that one might use (e.g., text corpora versus word associations) but there are commonalities between the two approaches. For example, there is evidence that the relationship between (observed) word association frequency and (latent) associative strength is nonlinear (Deese, 1965), an observation that suggests the PMI + measure might be reasonably successful as a simple count model for association strength. With that in mind our first model is a simple PMI + measure using the word association frequency as the input. 2 3.4 A spreading activation approach to semantic structure While the PMI + model captures the semantic information in the raw word association data, it does not attempt to capture any deeper semantic structure that these data encode. Inspired by classic work in human semantic memory by Collins and Loftus (1975), we use word association data to construct a network that connects associated words, and model semantic similarity using denser distributions derived from a random walk defined over this network, similar to the Katz index (Katz, 1953). The intuitive idea is that when a word is presented it activates the corresponding node in the graph, and starts a random walk (or many such walks) through the graph, activating nodes that the walk passes through. If there are many short paths that connect two nodes, then it is easy for a random walk through the graph to start at one node and end at the other, and the words are deemed to be more similar as a consequence.\nTo implement this idea we first normalize the word association matrix such that each row sums to 1, thus converting it to a transition matrix P. Then, in order to construct an explicit model to derive new direct paths between words, we consider the following iterative procedure (Newman, 2010). First consider a walk of a maximum length r where I is the identity matrix and a \"damping parameter\" \u03b1 < 1 governs the extent to which new paths are dominated by short paths or by longer paths. During each iteration, indirect links reflecting paths of length r are added to the graphs, producing this sequence of \"augmented\" graphs:\nG rw (r=0) = I G rw (r=1) = \u03b1P + I G rw (r=2) = \u03b1 2 P 2 + \u03b1P + I (1)\nIn these expressions, longer paths receive lower weights due to operation of the \u03b1 parameter. The probability of an associative chain surviving across r links is thus \u03b1 r . The smaller the value of \u03b1, the larger the contribution made by very short paths. This \"decay\" parameter serves an important role to limit the spread of activation and avoid the entire network to become quickly activated. In the limit, where we consider paths of arbitrarily long length (and accordingly, arbitrarily low weight) we obtain the following expression:\nG rw = \u221e r=0 (\u03b1P) r = I \u2212 \u03b1P \u22121 (2)\nAt this point, the \"random walk graph\" G rw combines paths of various lengths obtained from the random walk. However, these paths do not precisely match the associative strength measure proposed earlier, and to address this we apply the exact same procedure that we have used for the other models, namely the PMI + transformation. Applying the PMI weighing function to G rw reduces the frequency bias introduced by this type of walk (Newman, 2010) and also keeps the graph sparse.\nTo see how this spreading activation mechanism can be very powerful, consider the word tiger. Before applying spreading activation its meaning vector consists of 92 different association responses. When we apply the spreading activation measure we uncover nearly 559 new associations which ordered by their weights included zebra, cheetah, claws, cougar and carnivore, all of which seem meaningfully related to tiger but were not among the responses when tiger was presented as a cue word.", "publication_ref": ["b11", "b6", "b17"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Comparing model predictions to human judgments", "text": "To assess how well each of these four models captures human semantic knowledge, we evaluate them using several standard data sets that measure human judgments of similarity and relatedness, and addi-tionally introduce a new data set based on the \"remote triad task\".

Critically, the triads were constructed by choosing words largely at random from the English word association data set. The only constraints were that the words in a triad had to be roughly matched on judged concreteness and word frequency. This was done to avoid simple heuristics such as grouping abstract or common words together. The consequence of this procedure is that the triads tended to consist of words that are only weakly related to each other, such as BRANCH -ROCKET -SHEET or CLOUD -TENNIS -SURGEON, and it is for this reason it is referred to as the \"remote triads task\".

Similarity might be important in a NLP setting, for example in constructing thesauri, but the role of similarity in human semantic cognition is mostly an empirical matter. If anything, a variety of studies support a prominent role for relatedness. This includes semantic priming effects when processing a word proceeded by a related one (Hutchison, 2003), event-related potentials in EEG that are triggered by related but not similar words (Kutas and Hillyard, 1984) and fMRI studies that map the structure of the mental lexicon in a more thematic rather than taxonomic way based on similarity (Huth et al., 2016). Add to this that similarity can only be derived for certain concept combinations, and similarity ratings tend to be less reliable than relatedness ratings (Hill et al., 2016), suggests that relatedness judgments have broader use in studies of human semantic cognition.", "publication_ref": ["b15", "b19", "b16", "b14"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Future directions", "text": "One obvious way to improve E-language models is by including non-linguistic information as well. As mentioned in the introduction, access to imagery contributes to the responses people give in a word association task and this might explain the fact that I-language models perform very well on the basis of a small number of words. While recent studies have shown some promising results by enhancing language models with visual representations, there's still room for improvement. For example, Bruni et al. (2012) reported findings of a multimodal model that uses word embeddings combined with features extracted from images. An evaluation using the MEN dataset resulted in a correlation of .78 for the best performing model, which is considerably lower than current results for the E-language and especially the I-language models. 8 On the upside, if I-language models do considerably better because they have a privileged access to imagery compared to E-language model, this would also suggest that further improvements by constructing more elaborate multimodal representations are possible. More generally, because the both I-language and E-language models use the same kind of symbolic language-based representations, determining what kind of features (perceptual or other) make the I-language models so successful with very little data might also provide us with valuable pointers towards further refining existing E-language models and NLP applications build from them.\nGoing forward will also require us to increase the discriminatory power of existing benchmarks, by including judgments that focus on finer perceptual distinctions, or by capitalizing on how humans infer additional structure beyond what's available in E-language. In this study, we have shown that the remote triad task might be ideally suited to test how well a model can generalize beyond the input and provide a benchmark capable of differentiating competing models. Apart from more sophisticated and more realistic approximating of the E-language environment, there's also a need for better I-language models. While the new word association data addresses some issues from previous studies, future work will aim to include at least 20,000 different cues. Furthermore, improvements might be achieved by looking at native speakers only, applying differential weights to the primary, secondary and tertiary responses, or designing more elaborate spreading activating mechanisms.
