Automated information extraction has attracted considerable attention with various approaches developed to mine structured knowledge from unstructured text. In this tutorial, we present an organized picture of automated information extraction from massive text to answer the need of a systematic review and comparison of the techniques. We first introduce major tasks of information extraction such as named entity recognition and relation extraction. Then we introduce downstream applications such as heterogeneous information network construction and claim mining that utilize the extracted information. Specifically, we focus on the methods that are scalable, effective, minimum supervised and working on various kinds of text (e.g., news and biomedical science). We also demonstrate on a real-world dataset, PubMed that includes over 29 million biomedical literature, how the heterogeneous information network can be constructed and how the scientific claims can be automatically retrieved based on automated information extraction. The covered topics will be interesting to both advanced researchers and beginners in data mining, text mining, natural language processing and machine learning.", "sections": [{"heading": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Goals and Subtopics. The goal of this tutorial is to give a full picture of automated information extraction from massive text (see tutorial contents and tutorial outline). We will discuss the following key issues: (1) named entity recognition with distant supervision from knowledge bases; (2) open relation extraction without predefined relation types; (3) heterogeneous information network construction from text with minimum supervision; (4) scientific claim retrieval based on automated information extraction. Relevance to the Attendees. Text data is a powerful information source that covers almost every aspect of our life, including social media and health care. Automated information extraction has attracted considerable attentions with various approaches developed to mine structured knowledge from unstructured text. Traditionally, studies in NLP, machine learning or text mining communities focus on the methods for information extraction by obtaining a large amount of human annotated data and then train a machine learning model for information extraction. However, this paradigm suffers from the high cost and low efficiency in manual annotation. Recently, the data mining community has demonstrated the tremendous power of the data-driven methods for scalable and effective information extraction from massive text with minimum human supervision. Unfortunately, there lacks a systematic review of the recent progress for automated information extraction from massive text. This tutorial is to bridge this gap and explore the power of data-driven methods for automated information extraction.", "publication_ref": ["b1"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "II.

Introduction", "text": "We will first introduce the big picture of information extraction from massive text.

Named Entity Recognition", "text": "Named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify text spans as candidate entities and classifies them into a set of semantic classes, such as person and organization. Existing studies leverage either human-annotated corpus (fully supervised) or knowledge bases (distantly supervised) to train a sequence labeling model. We will cover both directions. Backgrounds and Supervised Methods. To start from the beginning, we will give an overview of the NER task and stateof-the-art supervised machine learning approaches [7]. Then we will introduce the popularly adopted neural architecture BiLSTM-CRF [10] and its variants (e.g., BiLSTM-CNN-CRF [15]). An application in biomedical NER [24] will also be covered as an example of integrating multiple corpora with different labeled entity types. Distantly Supervised Methods. To alleviate human effort, dictionaries and knowledge bases have been applied to automatically annotated raw corpus for training. We will cover some most recent studies [8], [19] utilizing heuristic matching rules and automatic phrase mining techniques when dealing with distant supervision.", "publication_ref": ["b6", "b9", "b14", "b24", "b7", "b19"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "C. Relation Extraction", "text": "Fully-supervised relation extraction (RE) approaches (e.g., [13], [22], [25]) aims to predict the relationship between a pair of entities in a sentence. These approaches encounter two challenges: (1) They usually require a large number of humanannotated sentences as training data, which are expensive to obtain. (2) The power of the trained relation classifier is confined to a given relation type set, which makes it hard to transfer the model to new relation types or new domains. After giving an overview of the RE task and fully-supervised methods, we will cover three types of minimum supervised approached tackling the above two challenges. Pattern-based Methods. Pattern-based approaches propose to automatically extract textual patterns without human supervision. We will cover approaches utilizing linguistic features (e.g., ReVerb [5] and PATTY [16]) and introduce techniques grouping synonymous patterns using extracted relation tuples (e.g., MetaPAD [9]). Open-domain Approaches. Open-domain information extraction relies on predicates to extract a subject and an object. We will introduce methods exploiting local context (e.g., ClausIE [3]) and incorporating global cohesiveness (e.g., ReMine [26]). Also, we will cover approaches dealing with high-arity relations [4] and its application in biomedical and clinical text. Weakly-supervised Methods. Weakly-supervised methods require users to provide a small set of sentences or entity pairs for each relation type. We will introduce traditional pattern-based bootstrapping approaches (e.g., Snowball [1]) and pattern-enhanced embedding learning methods [17].", "publication_ref": ["b12", "b22", "b25", "b4", "b15", "b8", "b2", "b26", "b3", "b0", "b16"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "D. Heterogeneous Information Network Construction", "text": "By viewing entities as nodes and relations as edges, a heterogeneous information network (HIN) can be constructed to represent structured knowledge from unstructured corpora. We will cover the following two tasks of heterogeneous information network construction. Network-based Document Summarization. Using a network to represent concepts and their relationships will bring structures into document summaries. Some attempts have been made to automatically construct concept networks from text. We will review existing studies covering education-related corpora [6], [23] and biomedical literature [20]. Factual Network Construction and Exploration. Automatically constructing structured networks from large amounts of background documents can support efficient exploration of structured factual knowledge. We will introduce Life-iNet [18], a network-based system to explore relationships between genes, drugs and diseases.", "publication_ref": ["b5", "b23", "b20", "b17"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "E. Claim Mining", "text": "Claim mining aims to automatically extract argumentative sentences from the text. There are two categories of claim mining methods based on the input: context-independent and context-dependent claim mining. We will first introduce the task of claim mining and the state-of-the-art supervised methods [11], [14]. Then we will introduce several recent studies that utilize limited human-annotated training data for claim mining [2], [12], [21]. Context-independent claim mining. Context-independent claim mining aims at detecting claims in a document without necessarily resorting to the contextual information [14]. It does not require any pre-defined topics and classifies every sentence to judge if it is a claim. Context-dependent claim mining Context-dependent claim mining aims at detecting claims that are specifically related to a pre-defined concrete context [11]. There are two basic concepts for context-dependent claim mining: (1) topic: a short query that frames the discussion, and (2) context-dependent claim (CDC): a concise statement retrieved from the text that directly supports or contests the given topic.\nFinally, we will conclude our tutorial by demonstrating on a real-world dataset, PubMed that includes over 29 million biomedical literature, how the heterogeneous information network can be constructed and how the scientific claims can be automatically retrieved based on automated information extraction. We will also summarize the techniques and discuss future directions.", "publication_ref": ["b10", "b13", "b1", "b11", "b21", "b13", "b10"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "IV.
