{"title": "Optimal False-Name-Proof Voting Rules with Costly Voting *", "authors": "Liad Wagman; Vincent Conitzer", "pub_date": "", "abstract": "One way for agents to reach a joint decision is to vote over the alternatives. In open, anonymous settings such as the Internet, an agent can vote more than once without being detected. A voting rule is false-name-proof if no agent ever benefits from casting additional votes. Previous work has shown that all false-name-proof voting rules are unresponsive to agents' preferences. However, that work implicitly assumes that casting additional votes is costless. In this paper, we consider what happens if there is a cost to casting additional votes. We characterize the optimal (most responsive) false-name-proofwith-costs voting rule for 2 alternatives. In sharp contrast to the costless setting, we prove that as the voting population grows larger, the probability that this rule selects the majority winner converges to 1. We also characterize the optimal group false-name-proof rule for 2 alternatives, which is robust to coalitions of agents sharing the costs of additional votes. Unfortunately, the probability that this rule chooses the majority winner as the voting population grows larger is relatively low. We derive an analogous rule in a setting with 3 alternatives, and provide bounding results and computational approaches for settings with 4 or more alternatives.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In multiagent systems, a general approach for the agents to make a joint decision is for all of them to report their preferences over the alternatives; then, based on these reported preferences, an outcome is chosen according to a mechanism (or rule). One serious complication is that if this is to their benefit, self-interested agents will lie about their preferences. Mechanism design is the study of how to design the mechanism so that good outcomes will be chosen in spite of such self-interested behavior. By a result known as the revelation principle (Gibbard 1973;Green & Laffont 1977;Myerson 1979;1981), we can, in a sense, without loss of generality focus our attention on mechanisms that choose outcomes in such a way that no agent has an incentive to lie. There are multiple ways of making this idea precise; the strongest is to require that the mechanism is strategy-proof, that is, each agent is always best off reporting its true preferences, no matter what those preferences are and what the other agents do.\nIn a general social choice (or voting) setting, there is a (usually finite) set of alternatives, and each agent reports ordinal preferences over these alternatives. For this very general setting, negative results are known: for example, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem (Gibbard 1973;Satterthwaite 1975) states that if there are at least three alternatives and preferences are unrestricted, then there exists no deterministic voting rule (mechanism) that is nondictatorial (more than one agent's preferences are taken into account), onto (for every alternative, there are some votes that make that alternative win), and strategy-proof. Still, there are also some positive results. For example, if there are only two alternatives, then the majority rule (choose whichever alternative receives more votes) is strategy-proof. Also, if preferences are single-peaked (Black 1948) (roughly, alternatives are ordered on a line and agents always prefer alternatives closer to their most-preferred alternative), then choosing the most-preferred alternative of the median voter is strategy-proof. If we assume additional structure-namely, each agent can make or receive payments and its preferences are quasilinear-then there are many strategy-proof mechanisms, for example, VCG mechanisms (Vickrey 1961;Clarke 1971;Groves 1973). But we will not consider mechanisms that use payments in this paper.\nUnfortunately, in open, anonymous environments such as the Internet, new manipulations are possible: namely, an agent can vote multiple times without being detected. If the mechanism is such that there is never an incentive for an agent to do so, the mechanism is said to be falsename-proof (Yokoo, Sakurai, & Matsubara 2004). 1 Falsename-proofness is a much more restrictive requirement than strategy-proofness: for example, not even the majority rule is false-name-proof. Recently, an extremely negative result has been obtained for false-name-proofness in voting settings (Conitzer 2007a): this result implies that, unless the agents unanimously agree that one alternative is preferred to another, then the winning alternative must be chosen uniformly at random. Given this result, it would seem reasonable to give up on false-name-proofness in general social choice settings. (For combinatorial auction settings, some reasonable false-name-proof mechanisms do exist (Yokoo, Sakurai, & Matsubara 2001;Yokoo 2003;Yokoo, Matsutani, & Iwasaki 2006), but here, too, impossibility results are known (Yokoo, Sakurai, & Matsubara 2004;Rastegari, Condon, & Leyton-Brown 2007).) Indeed, it has been proposed to perform some limited verification of agents' identities to remove the incentive to use false names (Conitzer 2007b).\nIn this paper, we consider another way around the impossibility result for false-name-proofness in voting settings. The impossibility result implicitly assumes that there is no cost to voting multiple times; however, it is reasonable to assume that casting an additional vote comes at a small cost. For example, to cast an additional vote, an agent may need to sign up for another (say, free e-mail) account, and this requires some effort (e.g. most free e-mail providers require a user to solve a CAPTCHA (von Ahn et al. 2003;von Ahn, Blum, & Langford 2004) before obtaining an account). In this context, a rule is false-name-proof (with costs) if the cost of casting additional votes always outweighs the benefit to an agent. We characterize the optimal rule with two alternatives in this setting, and show that as the number of agents grows, the probability that this rule chooses the alternative that the majority rule would have chosen, if there had been no false-name manipulation, converges to 1-a very positive result, in sharp contrast to the costless setting. However, we also consider the possibility that multiple agents collude and share the cost of the additional votes. We characterize the resulting optimal group false-name-proof mechanism and show that unfortunately, it does not have the convergence property. We also obtain some results for a 3-alternative setting, and propose a linear programming technique for settings with more alternatives, in the spirit of automated mechanism design (Conitzer & Sandholm 2002).", "publication_ref": ["b4", "b6", "b8", "b9", "b4", "b0", "b10", "b1", "b7", "b13", "b12", "b14", "b11", "b13", "b10", "b10", "b2"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Definitions", "text": "In this section, we consider a setting with 2 alternatives, A and B. We assume that each agent strictly prefers one of the alternatives; which alternative is preferred is private information to the agent. We normalize each agent's utility function so that the agent receives utility 1 if its favorite alternative is selected, and 0 otherwise. Votes can be cast either for A or for B. We assume that each agent can cast one vote for free; for each additional vote, the agent incurs a cost of c. This model can be generalized in several ways without changing the results; we discuss this in a later section. For simplicity of presentation we focus on the simpler model first. This model is reasonable, for example, when every agent already has an account (for other reasons), but signing up for an additional account is costly (either because there is a monetary cost, or because some effort needs to be exerted, e.g. a CAPTCHA needs to be solved to obtain the account).

The disadvantage of this rule is clear: even if one alternative receives 100 votes and the other, 1 vote, then a coin is flipped to determine the winner. That is, the rule is not very responsive to votes. In some sense, the \"most\" responsive rule is the majority rule, which chooses the alternative that receives more votes (and flips a coin if there is a tie), thereby maximizing the sum of the utilities. 2 However, the majority rule is not false-name-proof. As we will see shortly, when c > 0, there are false-name-proof rules that are more responsive (more like majority) than the unanimity rule above. Our objective is to maximize responsiveness under the constraint of false-name-proofness.\nOne may wonder how we should compare two rules if one is more responsive for some states, and the other is more responsive for other states. However, this turns out not to matter, because we will find a rule that is strongly optimal, that is, most responsive for all states.\nDefinition 7 (Strong optimality) A neutral false-nameproof voting rule P that satisfies voluntary participation is strongly optimal if for any other neutral false-nameproof voting rule P that satisfies voluntary participation, for any state (x A , x B ) where x A \u2265 x B , we have\nP A (x A , x B ) \u2265 P A (x A , x B ).\nIt should be noted that by neutrality, it follows that for such a rule we also have that if x A \u2264 x B , then\nP A (x A , x B ) \u2264 P A (x A , x B )\n.

We first prove that it satisfies the conditions of Lemma 1. We begin with Condition 1. If\nx A \u2265 x B > 0, then P A (x A + 1, x B ) \u2212 P A (x A , x B ) = min{1, 1 2 + c(x A + 1 \u2212 x B )} \u2212 min{1, 1 2 + c(x A \u2212 x B )} \u2265 0.

Finally, if x A = 0 or x B = 0, it is easy to check that P A (x A + 1, x B ) \u2212 P A (x A , x B ) \u2265 0.\nThis proves Condition 1; Condition 2 follows by symmetry.\nNext, we prove Condition 3. If\nx A + 1 \u2265 x B > 0, then P A (x A + 2, x B ) \u2212 P A (x A + 1, x B ) = min{1, 1 2 + c(x A + 2 \u2212 x B )} \u2212 min{1, 1 2 + c(x A + 1 \u2212 x B )} \u2264 c.

Finally, if x B = 0, then P A (x A + 2, x B ) \u2212 P A (x A + 1, x B ) = 1 \u2212 1 = 0.\nThis proves Condition 3; Condition 4 follows by symmetry. Hence, F N P 2 satisfies the conditions of Lemma 1, so it is in fact a neutral false-name-proof voting rule that satisfies voluntary participation.\nAll that remains to show is strong optimality, that is, for any other such rule P , for any state (x A , x B ) with x A \u2265 x B , P A (x A , x B ) \u2265 P A (x A , x B ), where P is F N P 2. (We recall that the analogous statement when x B \u2265 x A follows by symmetry.) Neutrality requires that for any x \u2265 0, P A (x, x) = 1/2. Next, for any x > 0, false-name proofness requires that P A (x + 1, x) \u2212 P A (x, x) \u2264 c, so that\nP A (x + 1, x) \u2264 1/2 + c. Similarly, P A (x + 2, x) \u2212 P A (x + 1, x) \u2264 c, so that P A (x + 2, x) \u2264 P A (x + 1, x) + c \u2264 1/2 + 2c.\nContinuing in the same manner, for any t > 0, P A (x + t, x) \u2264 1/2 + tc must hold. Also, naturally,\nP A (x + t, x) \u2264 1. So P A (x + t, x) \u2264 min{1, 1/2 + tc}. But P A (x + t, x) = min{1, 1/2 + tc}.

The \"majority winner\" here refers to the winner that the majority rule would have produced if every agent voted exactly once.\nOf course, if we actually used the majority rule, agents would likely use false names. Ideally, F N P 2 would usually choose the majority winner, in which case we get the best of both worlds: false-name-proofness and high responsiveness.\nTo make this concrete, suppose agents' preferences are drawn i.i.d.: with probability p an agent prefers A, with 1\u2212p, B. If c = 0, we need to use the aforementioned unanimity rule; now, as n grows, the probability of all agents agreeing goes to 0, and the probability of flipping a coin goes to 1. Hence, the rule becomes completely unresponsive as n \u2192 \u221e. But what if c > 0? Here, we get the opposite result:\nTheorem 2 As n \u2192 \u221e, the probability that F N P 2 chooses the majority winner converges to 1.\nWe omit the remaining proofs due to space constraint, but the intuition for this result is simple. F N P 2 randomizes only if the election is close to tied, that is, |x A \u2212 x B | < 1/(2c). However, as n increases, the binomial distribution over agent preferences converges to a flatter and flatter normal distribution. Hence, the probability that the election is close to tied goes to 0. When F N P 2 does not randomize, it chooses the majority winner.\nOf course, Theorem 2 only shows what happens in the limit. Figure 1 illustrates how often F N P 2 fails to choose the majority winner as a function of n. 3 The probability that F N P 2 fails to choose the majority winner also depends on c (the higher c, the less often it will do so), as illustrated in Figure 2.

This requires that the manipulating agents are able to commit to such a plan.\nWe call a rule in which coalitions never benefit from such a manipulation group false-name-proof (analogously to group strategy-proof). It is easy to see that F N P 2 is not group false-name-proof: in the example with c = .15 given above, if x A = x B = 2 (for the true preferences), then the two agents that prefer A have an incentive to make a contract to each cast an additional vote for A, resulting in a probability of .8 that A wins, so that each of these agents is .3 \u2212 .15 = .15 better off.

We continue to assume that each alternative receives at least one vote. We show how to find the rule that minimizes the expected distance to plurality (or any other rule P \u2032 ). (Standard tricks can be used to linearize the absolute value operator.)  We note that because we require strategy-proofness, it never makes sense to cast a false-name vote for another alternative, which simplifies constraint (4).", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Extensions and future work", "text": "In the above, we have assumed that all agents have the same cost c for casting an additional vote. In fact, all that is needed for all of the above results to go through is that we know that each agent has a cost of at least c for each additional vote (and this is the greatest lower bound that we know). In fact, a single agent can have different costs for, say, her first and second additional votes, as long as we know the cost for each to be at least c. Additionally, we have assumed the first vote is free (for example, everyone already has one e-mail account). The analysis can be extended to settings where an agent's first vote is costly. However, in such settings, voluntary participation cannot be satisfied.\nFuture work can take on a number of directions. An immediate direction is to more robustly extend our results to settings with 3 or more alternatives. This can also be done under different assumptions. For instance, one could derive the optimal false-name-proof rule that does not necessarily satisfy voluntary participation or strategy-proofness. One could also consider dichotomous preferences (Inada 1964), for which responsive strategy-proof rules exist. (Under such preferences, each voter (equally) approves of a set of alternatives and (equally) disapproves of the remaining alternatives.) Another direction is to extend the group false-nameproofness results to the setting where agents cannot use transfers and where only deterministic contracts are allowed. Yet another direction is to consider weaker (e.g. Bayes-Nash equilibrium) notions of false-name-proofness.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "", "text": "Definition 11 (Strong optimality) A neutral, strategyproof, and false-name-proof voting rule P that satisfies voluntary participation is strongly optimal if for any other neutral, strategy-proof, and false-name-proof voting rule P that satisfies voluntary participation, for any state (x A , x B , x C ) where\n(We emphasize that we are restricting attention to the case where every alternative receives at least one vote.)
