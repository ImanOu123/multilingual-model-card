The volume of online discourse surrounding polarizing issues-climate change, gun control, abortion, wage gaps, death penalty, taxes, same-sex marriage, and more-has been drastically growing in the past decade (Valenzuela et al., 2012;Rainie et al., 2012;Enikolopov et al., 2019). While online political engagement promotes democratic values and diversity of perspectives, these discussions also reflect and reinforce societal biases-stereotypical generalizations about people or social groups (Devine, 1989;Bargh, 1999;Blair, 2002). Such language constitutes a major portion of large language models' (LMs) pretraining data, propagating biases into downstream models.\nHundreds of studies have highlighted ethical issues in NLP models (Blodgett et al., 2020a;Field et al., 2021;Kumar et al., 2022) and designed synthetic datasets (Nangia et al., 2020;Nadeem et al., 2021) or controlled experiments to measure how biases in language are encoded in learned representations (Sun et al., 2019), and how annotator errors in training data are liable to increase unfairness of NLP models (Sap et al., 2019). However, the language of polarizing political issues is particularly complex (Demszky et al., 2019), and social biases hidden in language can rarely be reduced to pre-specified stereotypical associations (Joseph and Morgan, 2020). To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has shown how to analyze the effects of naturally occurring media biases in pretraining data on language models, and subsequently on downstream tasks, and how it affects the fairness towards diverse social groups. Our study aims to fill this gap.\nAs a case study, we focus on the effects of media biases in pretraining data on the fairness of hate speech detection with respect to diverse social attributes, such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation, and of misinformation detection with respect to partisan leanings. We investigate how media biases in the pretraining data propagate into LMs and ultimately affect downstream tasks, because discussions about polarizing social and economic issues are abundant in pretraining data sourced from news, forums, books, and online encyclopedias, and this language inevitably perpetuates social stereotypes. We choose hate speech and misinformation classification because these are social-oriented tasks in which unfair predictions can be especially harmful (Duggan, 2017;League, 2019League, , 2021.\nTo this end, grounded in political spectrum theories (Eysenck, 1957;Rokeach, 1973;Gindler, 2021) and the political compass test, 2 we propose to empirically quantify the political leaning of pretrained LMs ( \u00a72). We then further pretrain language models on different partisan corpora to investigate whether LMs pick up political biases from training data. Finally, we train classifiers on top of LMs with varying political leanings and evaluate their performance on hate speech instances targeting different identity groups (Yoder et al., 2022), and on misinformation detection with different agendas (Wang, 2017). In this way, we investigate the propagation of political bias through the entire pipeline from pretraining data to language models to downstream tasks.\nOur experiments across several data domains, partisan news datasets, and LM architectures ( \u00a73) demonstrate that different pretrained LMs do have different underlying political leanings, reinforcing the political polarization present in pretraining corpora ( \u00a74.1). Further, while the overall performance of hate speech and misinformation detectors remains consistent across such politically-biased LMs, these models exhibit significantly different behaviors against different identity groups and partisan media sources. ( \u00a74.2).\nThe main contributions of this paper are novel methods to quantify political biases in LMs, and findings that shed new light on how ideological polarization in pretraining corpora propagates biases into language models, and subsequently into social-oriented downstream tasks. In \u00a75, we discuss implications of our findings for NLP research, that no language model can be entirely free from social biases, and propose future directions to mitigate unfairness.", "publication_ref": ["b60", "b73", "b59", "b94", "b120", "b48", "b119", "b105", "b40", "b33", "b9", "b14", "b16", "b45", "b26", "b96", "b95", "b114", "b109", "b32", "b70", "b38", "b41", "b107", "b51", "b126", "b123"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Methodology", "text": "We propose a two-step methodology to establish the effect of political biases in pretraining corpora on the fairness of downstream tasks: (1) we develop a framework, grounded in political science literature, to measure the inherent political leanings of pretrained language models, and (2) then investi-gate how the political leanings of LMs affect their performance in downstream social-oriented tasks.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Measuring the Political Leanings of LMs", "text": "While prior works provided analyses of political leanings in LMs (Jiang et al., 2022a;Argyle et al., 2022), they primarily focused on political individuals, rather than the timeless ideological issues grounded in political science literature. In contrast, our method is grounded in political spectrum theories (Eysenck, 1957;Rokeach, 1973;Gindler, 2021) that provide more nuanced perspective than the commonly used left vs. right distinction (Bobbio, 1996;Mair, 2007;Corballis and Beale, 2020) by assessing political positions on two axes: social values (ranging from liberal to conservative) and economic values (ranging from left to right).\nThe widely adopted political compass test, 2 which is based on these theories, measures individuals' leaning on a two-dimensional space by analyzing their responses to 62 political statements. 3 Participants indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with each statement, and their responses are used to calculate their social and economic scores through weighted summation. Formally, the political compass test maps a set of answers indicating agreement level {STRONG DISAGREE, DISAGREE, AGREE, STRONG AGREE} 62 to twodimensional point (s soc , s eco ), where the social score s soc and economic score s eco range from [\u221210, 10]. We employ this test as a tool to measure the political leanings of pretrained language models.\nWe probe a diverse set of LMs to measure their alignment with specific political statements, including encoder and language generation models (decoder and autoregressive). For encoderonly LMs, we use mask filling with prompts derived from the political statements. We construct the following prompt: \"Please respond to the following statement: [STATEMENT] I <MASK> with this statement.\" Then, pretrained LMs fill the mask and return 10 highest probability tokens. By comparing the aggregated probability of pre-defined positive (agree, support, endorse, etc.)   We probe language generation models by conducting text generation based on the following prompt: \"Please respond to the following statement: [STATEMENT] \\n Your response:\". We then use an off-the-shelf stance detector  to determine whether the generated response agrees or disagrees with the given statement. We use 10 random seeds for prompted generation, filter low-confidence responses using the stance detector, and average the stance detection scores for a more reliable evaluation. 5 Using this framework, we aim to systematically evaluate the effect of polarization in pretraining data on the political bias of LMs. We thus train multiple partisan LMs through continued pretraining of existing LMs on data from various political viewpoints, and then evaluate how model's ideological coordinates shift. In these experiments, we only use established media sources, because our ultimate goal is to understand whether \"clean\" pretraining data (not overtly hateful or toxic) leads to undesirable biases in downstream tasks.", "publication_ref": ["b66", "b4", "b41", "b107", "b51", "b18", "b90", "b29"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Measuring the Effect of LM's Political Bias on Downstream Task Performance", "text": "Armed with the LM political leaning evaluation framework, we investigate the impact of these biases on downstream tasks with social implications such as hate speech detection and misinformation identification.

The stance detector has an accuracy of 0.97 for LM responses with clear stances and high interannotator agreement among 3 annotators (0.85 Fleiss' Kappa).

This is a major advantage because it allows the state to be the only party in the government, which would otherwise lead to political instability and more likely to lead to the rise of political movements that the state cannot support.\nI strongly agree with this statement.\nMothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.\nThere is a great diversity of women entrepreneurs.

We also include subreddits that are not about politics as the center corpus for social media. Additionally, to address ethical concerns of creating hateful LMs, we used a hate speech classifier based on RoBERTa  and fine-tuned on the TweetEval benchmark (Barbieri et al., 2020) to remove potentially hateful content from the pretraining data.\nAs a result, we obtained six pretraining corpora of comparable sizes: {LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT} \u00d7 {REDDIT, NEWS}. 7 These partisan pretraining corpora are approximately the same size.

Specifically, each original LM is mapped to a social score and an economic score with our proposed framework in Section 2.1. From the results, we find that:\n\u2022 Language models do exhibit different ideological leanings, occupying all four quadrants on the political compass.\n\u2022 Generally, BERT variants of LMs are more socially conservative (authoritarian) compared to GPT model variants. This collective difference may be attributed to the composition of pretraining corpora: while the BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015) played a significant role in early LM pretraining, Web texts such as Common-Crawl 8 and WebText (Radford et al., 2019) have become dominant pretraining corpora in more recent models. Since modern Web texts tend to be more liberal (libertarian) than older book texts (Bell, 2014), it is possible that LMs absorbed this liberal shift in pretraining data. Such differences could also be in part attributed to the reinforcement learning with human feedback data adopted in GPT-3 models and beyond. We additionally observe that different sizes of the same model family (e.g. ALBERT and BART) could have non-negligible differences in political leanings. We hypothesize that the change is due to a better generalization in large LMs, including overfitting biases in more subtle contexts, resulting in a shift of political leaning. We leave further investigation to future work.\n\u2022 Pretrained LMs exhibit stronger bias towards social issues (y axis) compared to economic ones (x axis). The average magnitude for social and economic issues is 2.97 and 0.87, respectively, with standard deviations of 1.29 and 0.84. This suggests that pretrained LMs show greater disagreement in their values concerning social issues. A possible reason is that the volume of social issue discussions on social media is higher than economic issues (Flores-Saviaga et al., 2022;Raymond et al., 2022), since the bar for discussing economic issues is higher (Crawford et al., 2017;Johnston and Wronski, 2015), requiring background knowledge and a deeper understanding of economics.\nWe conducted a qualitative analysis to compare the responses of different LMs. Table 2 presents the responses of three pretrained LMs to political statements. While GPT-2 expresses support for \"tax the rich\", GPT-3 Ada and Davinci are clearly against it. Similar disagreements are observed regarding the role of women in the workforce, democratic governments, and the social responsibility of corporations.\nThe Effect of Pretraining with Partisan Corpora Figure 3 shows the re-evaluated political leaning of RoBERTa and GPT-2 after being further pretrained with 6 partisan pretraining corpora ( \u00a73):\n\u2022 LMs do acquire political bias from pretraining corpora. Left-leaning corpora generally resulted in a left/liberal shift on the political compass, while right-leaning corpora led to a right/conservative shift from the checkpoint. This is particularly noticeable for RoBERTa further pretrained on REDDIT-LEFT, which resulted in a substantial liberal shift in terms of social values (2.97 to \u22123.03). However, most of the ideological shifts are relatively small, suggesting that it is hard to alter the inherent bias present in initial pretrained LMs. We hypothesize that this may be due to differences in the size and training time of the pretraining corpus, which we further explore when we examine hyperpartisan LMs. \u2022 For RoBERTa, the social media corpus led to an average change of 1.60 in social values, while the news media corpus resulted in a change of 0.64. For economic values, the changes were 0.90 and 0.61 for news and social media, respectively. User-generated texts on social media have a greater influence on the social values of LMs, while news media has a greater influence on economic values. We speculate that this can be attributed to the difference in coverage (Cacciatore et al., 2012;Guggenheim et al., 2015): while news media often reports on economic issues (Ballon, 2014), political discussions on social media tend to focus more on controversial \"culture wars\" and social issues (Amedie, 2015).\nPre-Trump vs. Post-Trump News and social media are timely reflections of the current sentiment of society, and there is evidence (Abramowitz and McCoy, 2019;Galvin, 2020;Hout and Maggio, 2021) suggesting that polarization is at an alltime high since the election of Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States. To examine  whether our framework detects the increased polarization in the general public, we add a pre-and post-Trump dimension to our partisan corpora by further partitioning the 6 pretraining corpora into preand post-January 20, 2017. We then pretrain the RoBERTa and GPT-2 checkpoints with the pre-and post-Trump corpora respectively. Figure 2 demonstrates that LMs indeed pick up the heightened polarization present in pretraining corpora, resulting in LMs positioned further away from the center. In addition to this general trend, for RoBERTa and the REDDIT-RIGHT corpus, the post-Trump LM is more economically left than the pre-Trump counterpart. Similar results are observed for GPT-2 and the NEWS-RIGHT corpus. This may seem counterintuitive at first glance, but we speculate that it provides preliminary evidence that LMs could also detect the anti-establishment sentiment regarding economic issues among right-leaning communities, similarly observed as the Sanders-Trump voter phenomenon (Bump, 2016;Trudell, 2016).", "publication_ref": ["b103", "b11", "b106", "b30", "b69", "b24", "b54", "b6", "b2", "b0", "b47", "b62", "b22"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": ["tab_2"]}, {"heading": "Examining the Potential of Hyperpartisan LMs", "text": "Since pretrained LMs could move further away from the center due to further pretraining on partisan corpora, it raises a concern about dual use: training a hyperpartisan LM and employing it to further deepen societal divisions. We hypothesize that this might be achieved by pretraining for more epochs and with more partisan data. To test this, we further pretrain the RoBERTa checkpoint with more epochs and larger corpus size and examine the trajectory on the political compass. Figure 4 demonstrates that, fortunately, this simple strategy is not resulting in increasingly partisan LMs: on economic issues, LMs remain close to the center; on social issues, we observe that while pretraining does lead to some changes, training with more data   for more epochs is not enough to push the models' scores towards the polar extremes of 10 or \u221210.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_2"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Political Leaning and Downstream Tasks", "text": "Overall Performance We compare the performance of five models: base RoBERTa and four RoBERTa models further pretrained with REDDIT-LEFT, NEWS-LEFT, REDDIT-RIGHT, and NEWS-RIGHT corpora, respectively.

(Akhtar et al., 2020;Flores-Saviaga et al., 2022), we propose using a combination, or ensemble, of pretrained LMs with different political leanings to take advantage of their collective knowledge for downstream tasks. By incorporating multiple LMs representing different perspectives, we can introduce a range of viewpoints into the decision-making process, instead of relying solely on a single perspec-tive represented by a single language model. We evaluate a partisan ensemble approach and report the results in Table 6, which demonstrate that partisan ensemble actively engages diverse political perspectives, leading to improved model performance.

For example, a model becomes better at identifying factual inconsistencies from New York Times news when it is pretrained with corpora from right-leaning sources. This presents an opportunity to create models tailored to specific scenarios. For example, in a downstream task focused on detecting hate speech from white supremacy groups, it might be beneficial to further pretrain LMs on corpora from communities that are more critical of white supremacy. Strategic pretraining might have great improvements in specific scenarios, but curating ideal scenario-specific pretraining corpora may pose challenges.\nOur work opens up a new avenue for identifying the inherent political bias of LMs and further study is suggested to better understand how to reduce and leverage such bias for downstream tasks.", "publication_ref": ["b1"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_6", "tab_10"]}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Understanding Social Bias of LMs Studies have been conducted to measure political biases and predict the ideology of individual users (Colleoni et al., 2014;Makazhanov and Rafiei, 2013;Preo\u0163iuc-Pietro et al., 2017), news articles (Li and Goldwasser, 2019;Feng et al., 2021;Liu et al., 2022b;, and political entities (Anegundi et al., 2022;Feng et al., 2022).

However, we present a general methodology to probe the political leaning of LMs that is compatible with any ideological theories, tests, and questionnaires. We encourage readers to use our approach along with other ideological theories and tests for a more well-rounded evaluation.\nProbing Language Models For encoder-based language models, our approach of mask in-filling is widely adopted in numerous existing works (Petroni et al., 2019;. For language generation models, we curate prompts, conduct prompted text generation, and employ a BARTbased stance detector for response evaluation. An alternative approach would be to explicitly frame it as a multi-choice question in the prompt, forcing pretrained language models to choose from STRONG AGREE, AGREE, DISAGREE, and STRONG DISAGREE. These two approaches have their respective pros and cons: our approach is compatible with all LMs that support text generation and is more interpretable, while the response mapping and the stance detector could be more subjective and rely on empirical hyperparameter settings; multichoice questions offer direct and unequivocal answers, while being less interpretable and does not work well with LMs with fewer parameters such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019).", "publication_ref": ["b41", "b15", "b61", "b35", "b64", "b93", "b101", "b103"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Fine-Grained Political Leaning Analysis", "text": "In this work, we \"force\" each pretrained LM into its position on a two-dimensional space based on their responses to social and economic issues. However, political leaning could be more fine-grained than two numerical values: being liberal on one issue does not necessarily exclude the possibility of being conservative on another, and vice versa. We leave it to future work on how to achieve a more fine-grained understanding of LM political leaning in a topic-and issue-specific manner.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Ethics Statement", "text": "U.S.-Centric Perspectives The authors of this work are based in the U.S., and our framing in this work, e.g., references to minority identity groups, reflects this context. This viewpoint is not universally applicable and may vary in different contexts and cultures.\nMisuse Potential In this paper, we showed that hyperpartisan LMs are not simply achieved by pretraining on more partisan data for more epochs. However, this preliminary finding does not exclude the possibility of future malicious attempts at creating hyperpartisan language models, and some might even succeed. Training and employing hyperpartisan LMs might contribute to many malicious purposes, such as propagating partisan misinformation or adversarially attacking pretrained language models (Bagdasaryan and Shmatikov, 2022). We will refrain from releasing the trained hyperpartisan language model checkpoints and will establish access permission for the collected partisan pretraining corpora to ensure its research-only usage.\nInterpreting Downstream Task Performance While we showed that pretrained LMs with different political leanings could have different performances and behaviors on downstream tasks, this empirical evidence should not be taken as a judgment of individuals and communities with certain political leanings, rather than a mere reflection of the empirical behavior of pretrained LMs.\nAuthors' Political Leaning Although the authors strive to conduct politically impartial analysis throughout the paper, it is not impossible that our inherent political leaning has impacted experiment interpretation and analysis in unperceived ways. We encourage the readers to also examine the models and results by themselves, or at least be aware of this possibility.

Specifically, we retrieve the top-10 probable token for mask filling, aggregate the probability of positive and negative words, and set a threshold to map them to {STRONG DISAGREE, DISAGREE, AGREE, STRONG AGREE}. A complete list of positive and negative words adopted is presented in Table 7, which is obtained after manually examining the output probabilities of 100 examples. We then compare the probability of positive words and negative words to settle AGREE v.s.

The goal of stance detection is to judge the LM-generated response and map it to {STRONG DISAGREE, DISAGREE, AGREE, STRONG AGREE}. To this end, we employed the FACEBOOK/BART-LARGE-MNLI checkpoint on Huggingface Transformers, which is BART  fine-tuned on the multiNLI dataset (Williams et al., 2018), to initialize a zero-shot classification pipeline of AGREE and DISAGREE, evaluating whether the response entails agreement or disagreement. We further conduct a human evaluation of the stance detector: we select 110 LM-generated responses, annotate the responses, and compare the human annotations with the results of the stance detector. The three annotators are graduate students in the U.S., with prior knowledge both in NLP and U.S. politics. This human evaluation answers a few key questions:\n\u2022 Do language models provide clear responses to political propositions? Yes, since 80 of the 110 LM responses provide responses with a clear stance. The Fleiss' Kappa of annotation agreement is 0.85, which signals strong agreement among annotators regarding the stance of LM responses.\n\u2022 Is the stance detector accurate? Yes, on the 80 LM responses with a clear stance, the BARTbased stance detector has an accuracy of 97%. This indicates that the stance detector is reliable in judging the agreement of LM-generated responses.\n\u2022 How do we deal with unclear LM responses?\nWe observed that the 30 unclear responses have an average stance detection confidence of 0.76, while the 80 unclear responses have an average confidence of 0.90. This indicates that the stance detector's confidence could serve as a heuristic to filter out unclear responses. As a result, we retrieve the top-10 probable LM responses, remove the ones with lower than 0.9 confidence, and aggregate the scores of the remaining responses.\nTo sum up, we present a reliable framework to probe the political leaning of pretrained language models.

We further examine whether the political opinion of language models stays stable in the face of changes in prompts and political statements. Specifically, we design 6 more prompts to investigate the sensitivity toward prompts. We similarly use 6 paraphrasing models to paraphrase the political propositions and investigate the sensitivity towards paraphrasing. We present the results of four LMs in Figure 5, which illustrates that GPT-3 DaVinci (Brown et al., 2020) provides the most consistent responses, while the political opinions of all pretrained LMs are moderately stable.\nWe further evaluate the stability of LM political leaning with respect to minor changes in prompts.

Table4illustrates a notable variation in the behavior of models based on their political bias. In particular, for hate speech detection, models with left-leaning biases exhibit better performance towards hate speech directed at widely-regarded minority groups such as LGBTQ+ and BLACK, while models with right-leaning biases tend to perform better at identifying hate speech targeting dominant identity groups such as MEN and WHITE. For misinformation detection, left-leaning LMs are more stringent with misinformation from right-leaning media but are less sensitive to misinformation from left-leaning sources such as CNN and NYT. Right-leaning LMs show the opposite pattern. These results highlight the concerns regarding the amplification of political biases in pretraining data within LMs, which subsequently propagate into downstream tasks and directly impact model (un)fairness.Table5provides further qualitative analysis and examples that illustrate distinctive behaviors exhibited by pretrained LMs with different political leanings. Right-leaning LMs overlook racist accusations of \"race mixing with asians,\" whereas leftleaning LMs correctly identify such instances as hate speech. In addition, both left-and right-leaning LMs demonstrate double standards for misinformation regarding the inaccuracies in comments made by Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders.5 Reducing the Effect of Political BiasOur findings demonstrate that political bias can lead to significant issues of fairness.
