Prior work strives to attribute model decisions to individual input features with different saliency measures, but they fail to explain how these input features interact with each other to reach predictions. In this paper, we propose a self-attention attribution method to interpret the information interactions inside Transformer. We take BERT as an example to conduct extensive studies. Firstly, we apply selfattention attribution to identify the important attention heads, while others can be pruned with marginal performance degradation. Furthermore, we extract the most salient dependencies in each layer to construct an attribution tree, which reveals the hierarchical interactions inside Transformer. Finally, we show that the attribution results can be used as adversarial patterns to implement non-targeted attacks towards BERT.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) is one of state-of-the-art NLP architectures. For example, most pre-trained language models (Devlin et al. 2019;Liu et al. 2019;Dong et al. 2019;Bao et al. 2020;Clark et al. 2020;Conneau et al. 2020;Chi et al. 2020a,b) choose stacked Transformer as the backbone network. Their great success stimulates broad research on interpreting the internal black-box behaviors. Some prior efforts aim at analyzing the self-attention weights generated by Transformer (Clark et al. 2019;Kovaleva et al. 2019). In contrast, some other work argues that self-attention distributions are not directly interpretable (Serrano and Smith 2019;Jain and Wallace 2019;Brunner et al. 2020). Another line of work strives to attribute model decisions back to input tokens (Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan 2017;Shrikumar, Greenside, and Kundaje 2017;Binder et al. 2016). However, most previous attribution methods fail on revealing the information interactions between the input words and the compositional structures learnt by the network.\nTo address the above issues, we propose a self-attention attribution method (ATTATTR) based on integrated gradient (Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan 2017). We conduct ex-periments for BERT (Devlin et al. 2019) because it is one of the most representative Transformer-based models. Notice that our method is general enough, and can be applied to other Transformer networks without significant modifications. Results show that our method well indicates the information flow inside Transformer, which makes the selfattention mechanism more interpretable.\nFirstly, we identify the most important attention connections in each layer using ATTATTR. We find that attention weights do not always correlate well with their contributions to the model prediction. We then introduce a heuristic algorithm to construct self-attention attribution trees, which discovers the information flow inside Transformer. In addition, a quantitative analysis is applied to justify how much the edges of an attribution tree contribute to the final prediction.\nNext, we use ATTATTR to identify the most important attention heads and perform head pruning. The derived algorithm achieves competitive performance compared with the Taylor expansion method (Michel, Levy, and Neubig 2019). Moreover, we find that the important heads of BERT are roughly consistent across different datasets as long as the tasks are homogeneous.\nFinally, we extract the interaction patterns that contribute most to the model decision, and use them as adversarial triggers to attack BERT-based models. We find that the finetuned models tend to over-emphasize some word patterns to make the prediction, which renders the prediction process less robust. For example, on the MNLI dataset, adding one adversarial pattern into the premise can drop the accuracy of entailment from 82.87% to 0.8%. The results show that ATTATTR not only can interpret the model decisions, but also can be used to find anomalous patterns from data.\nThe contributions of our work are as follows:\n\u2022 We propose to use self-attention attribution to interpret the information interactions inside Transformer. \u2022 We conduct extensive studies for BERT.

Given input tokens {x i } |x| i=1 , we pack their word embeddings to a matrix\nX 0 = [x 1 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , x |x| ]. The stacked L-layer Transformer computes the final output via X l = Transformer l (X l\u22121 ), l \u2208 [1, L].\nThe core component of a Transformer block is multi-head self-attention. The h-th self-attention head is described as:\nQ h = XW Q h , K = XW K h , V = XW V h (1) A h = softmax( Q h K h \u221a d k ) (2) H h = AttentionHead(X) = A h V h (3)\nwhere Q, K \u2208 R n\u00d7d k , V \u2208 R n\u00d7dv , and the score A i,j indicates how much attention token x i puts on x j .

The pretrained language model is based on bidirectional Transformer, which can be fine-tuned towards downstream tasks. Notice that our method can also be applied to other multi-layer Transformer models with few modifications. For single input, a special token [CLS] is added to the beginning of the sentence, and another token [SEP] is added to the end. For pairwise input, [SEP] is also added as a separator between the two sentences. When BERT is finetuned on classification tasks, a softmax classifier is added on top of the [CLS] token in the last layer to make predictions.\n3 Methods: Self-Attention Attribution\nFigure 1a shows attention scores of one head in fine-tuned BERT. We observe that the attention score matrix is quite dense, although only one of twelve heads is plotted. It poses a huge burden on us to understand how words interact with each other within Transformer. Moreover, even if an attention score is large, it does not mean the pair of words is important to model decisions. In contrast, we aim at attributing model decisions to self-attention relations, which tends to assign higher scores if the interaction contributes more to the final prediction. Given input sentence x, let F x (\u2022) represent the Transformer model, which takes the attention weight matrix A (Equation ( 2)) as the model input. Inspired by Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan (2017), we manipulate the internal attention scores\u0100, and observe the corresponding model dynamics F x (\u0100) to inspect the contribution of word interactions. As the attribution is always targeted for a given input x, we omit it for the simplicity of notations.\nLet us take one Transformer layer as an example to describe self-attention attribution. Our goal is to calculate an attribution score for each attention connection. For the h-th attention head, we compute its attribution score matrix as:\nA = [A 1 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , A |h| ] Attr h (A) = A h 1 \u03b1=0 \u2202F(\u03b1A) \u2202A h d\u03b1 \u2208 R n\u00d7n\nwhere is element-wise multiplication, A h \u2208 R n\u00d7n denotes the h-th head's attention weight matrix (Equation (2)), and \u2202F(\u03b1A) \u2202A h computes the gradient of model F(\u2022) along A h . The (i, j)-th element of Attr h (A) is computed for the interaction between input token x i and x j in terms of the h-th attention head.\nThe starting point (\u03b1 = 0) of the integration represents that all tokens do not attend to each other in a layer. When \u03b1 changes from 0 to 1, if the attention connection (i, j) has a great influence on the model prediction, its gradient will be salient, so that the integration value will be correspondingly large. Intuitively, Attr h (A) not only takes attention scores into account, but also considers how sensitive model predictions are to an attention relation.\nThe attribution score can be efficiently computed via Riemman approximation of the integration (Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan 2017). Specifically, we sum the gradients at points occurring at sufficiently small intervals along the straightline path from the zero attention matrix to the original attention weight A:\nAttr h (A) = A h m m k=1 \u2202F( k m A) \u2202A h (4\n)\nwhere m is the number of approximation steps. In our experiments, we set m to 20, which performs well in practice. Figure 1 is an example about the attention score map and the attribution score map of a single head in fine-tuned BERT. We demonstrate that larger attention scores do not mean more contribution to the final prediction. The attention scores between the [SEP] token and other tokens are relatively large, but they obtain little attribution scores. The prediction of the contradiction class attributes most to the connections between \"don't\" in the first segment and \"I know\" in the second segment, which is more explainable.", "publication_ref": ["b15", "b34", "b34"], "figure_ref": ["fig_3", "fig_3"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "We employ BERT-base-cased (Devlin et al. 2019) in our experiments. The number of BERT layers |l| = 12, the number of attention heads in each layer |h| = 12, and the size of hidden embeddings |h|d v = 768. For a sequence of 128 tokens, the attribution time of the BERT-base model takes about one second on an Nvidia-v100 GPU card. Moreover, the computation can be parallelized by batching multiple input examples to increase throughput.\nWe perform BERT fine-tuning and conduct experiments on four downstream classification datasets: MNLI (Williams, Nangia, and Bowman 2018) Multi-genre Natural Language Inference is to predict whether a premise entails the hypothesis (entailment), contradicts the given hypothesis (contradiction), or neither (neutral).

SST-2 (Socher et al. 2013) Stanford Sentiment Treebank is to predict the polarity of a given sentence.

We prune the attention heads incrementally in each layer according to their attribution scores with respect to the golden label and record the performance change. We also establish a baseline that prunes attention heads with their average attention scores for comparison.\nExperimental results are presented in Figure 2, we observe that pruning heads with attributions scores conduces more salient changes on the performance. Pruning only two heads within every layer with the top-2 attribution scores can cause an extreme decrease in the model accuracy. In contrast, retaining them helps the model to achieve nearly 97% accuracy. Even if only two heads are retained in each layer, the model can still have a strong performance. Compared with attribution scores, pruning heads with average attention scores are less remarkable on the performance change, which proves the effectiveness of our method.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Use Case 1: Attention Head Pruning", "text": "According to the previous section, only a small part of attention heads contribute to the final prediction, while others are less helpful. This leads us to the research about identifying and pruning the unimportant attention heads.\nHead Importance The attribution scores indicate how much a self-attention edge attributes to the final model decision. We define the importance of an attention head as:\nI h = E x [max(Attr h (A))](5)\nwhere x represents the examples sampled from the held-out set, and max(Attr h (A)) is the maximum attribution value of the h-th attention head. Notice that the attribution value of a head is computed with respect to the probability of the golden label on a held-out set.\nWe compare our method with other importance metrics based on the accuracy difference and the Taylor expansion, which are both proposed in (Michel, Levy, and Neubig 2019). The accuracy difference of an attention head is the accuracy margin before and after pruning the head. The method based on the Taylor expansion defines the importance of an attention head as:\nI h = E x A h \u2202L(x) \u2202A h (6\n)\nwhere L(x) is the loss function of example x, and A h is the attention score of the h-th head as in Equation (2). For all three methods, we calculate I h on 200 examples sampled from the held-out dataset. Then we sort all the heads according to the importance metrics. The less important heads are first pruned.\nEvaluation Results of Head Pruning Figure 3 describes the evaluation results of head pruning. The solid red lines represent pruning heads based on our method ATTATTR. We observe that pruning head with attribution score is much better than the baseline of accuracy difference.\nMoreover, the pruning performance of ATTATTR is competitive with the Taylor expansion method, although AT-TATTR is not specifically designed for attention head pruning. The result show that attention attribution successfully indicates the importance of interactions inside Transformer. On the MNLI dataset, when only 10% attention heads are retained, our method can still achieve approximately 60% accuracy, while the accuracy of the Taylor expansion method is about 40%.\nUniversality of Important Heads Previous results are performed on specific datasets respectively. Besides identifying the most important heads of Transformer, we investigate whether the important heads are consistent across different datasets and tasks. The correlation of attribution scores of attention heads between two different datasets is measured by the Pearson coefficient. As described in Figure 4, as long as the tasks are homogeneous (i.e., solving similar problems), the important attention heads are highly correlated. The datasets RTE, MPRC, and MNLI are about entailment detection, where the important self- The datasets of homogeneous tasks are strongly correlated, which implies the same subset of attention heads are finetuned for similar tasks.\nattention heads (i.e., with large attribution scores) of BERT are roughly consistent across the datasets. In contrast, the dataset SST-2 is sentiment classification. We find that the important heads on SST-2 are different from the ones on RTE, and MRPC. In conclusion, the same subset of attention heads is fine-tuned for similar tasks.", "publication_ref": ["b27"], "figure_ref": ["fig_1", "fig_2"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Use Case 2: Visualizing Information Flow Inside Transformer", "text": "We propose a heuristic algorithm to construct attribution trees based on the method described in Section 3, the results discover the information flow inside Transformer, so that we can know the interactions between the input words and how they attribute to the final prediction. Such visualization can provide insights to understand what dependencies Transformer tends to capture. The post-interpretation helps us to debug models and training data.\nThe problem is a trade-off between maximizing the summation of attribution scores and minimizing the number of edges in the tree. We present a greedy top-down algorithm to efficiently construct attribution trees. Moreover, we conduct a quantitative analysis to verify the effectiveness.\nAttribution Tree Construction After computing selfattention attribution scores, we can know the interactions between the input words in each layer and how they attribute to the final prediction. We then propose an attribution tree construction algorithm to aggregate the interactions. In other words, we build a tree to indicate how information flows from input tokens to the final predictions. We argue that such for (i, j) l i =j \u2208 E l do 11:\nif Statei is Appear and Statej is NotAppear then 12:\nE \u2190 E {(i, j)} 13:\nV \u2190 V {j} 14:\nStatei = Fixed 15: Statej = Appear 16:\nif Statei is Fixed and Statej is NotAppear then 17:\nE \u2190 E {(i, j)} 18:\nV \u2190 V {j} 19:\nStatej = Appear 20: Add the terminal of the information flow\n21: V \u2190 {[CLS]} 22: for j \u2190 n, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , 1 do 23:\nif Statej \u2208 {Appear, Fixed} then 24:\nE \u2190 E {([CLS], j)} 25: return T ree = {V, E} visualization can provide insights to understand what dependencies Transformer tends to capture.\nFor each layer l, we first calculate self-attention attribution scores of different heads. Then we sum them up over the heads, and use the results as the l-th layer's attribution:\nAttr(A l ) = |h| h=1 Attr h (A l ) = [a l i,j ] n\u00d7n\nwhere larger a l i,j indicates more interaction between x i and x j in the l-th layer in terms of the final model predictions.\nThe construction of attribution trees is a trade-off between maximizing the summation of attribution scores and minimizing the number of edges in the tree. The objective is defined as:\nTree = arg max {E l } |l| l=1 |l| l=1 (i,j)\u2208E l a l i,j \u2212 \u03bb |l| l=1 |E l |, E l \u2282 {(i, j)| a l i,j max(Attr(A l )) > \u03c4 }\nwhere |E l | represents the number of edges in the l-th layer, \u03bb is a trade-off weight, and the threshold \u03c4 is used to filter the interactions with relatively large attribution scores. Rather than solving a combinatorial optimization problem, we use a heuristic top-down method to add these edges to the attribution tree. The process is detailed in Algorithm 1. The more detailed related explanations are in the appendix.\nSettings We set \u03c4 = 0.4 for layers l < 12. The larger \u03c4 tends to generate more simplified trees, which contains the more important part of the information flow. Because the special token [CLS] is the terminal of the information flow for classification tasks, we set \u03c4 to 0 for the last layer. We observe that almost all connections between [CLS] and other tokens in the last layer have positive attribution scores with respect to model predictions.\nCase Studies As shown in Figure 5, the two attribution trees are from MNLI and SST-2, respectively. The attribution tree Figure 5a is generated from MNLI, whose golden label is entailment. At the bottom of Figure 5a, we find that the interactions are more local, and most information flows are concentrated within a single sentence. The information is hierarchically aggregated to \"supplement\" and \"extra\" in each sentence. Then the \"supplement\" token aggregates the information in the first sentence and \"add something extra\" in the second sentence, these two parts \"supplement\" and \"add something extra\" have strong semantic relevance. Finally, all the information flows to the terminal token [CLS] to make the prediction entailment. The attribution tree interprets how the input words interacts with each other, and reach the final prediction, which makes model decisions more interpretable. Figure 5b is an example from SST-2, whose golden label is positive, correctly predicted by the model. From Figure 5b, we observe that information in the first part of the sentence \"seldom has a movie so closely\" is aggregated to the \"has\" token. Similarly, information in the other part of the sentence \"the spirit of a man and his work\" flows to the \"spirit\" token, which has strong positive emotional tendencies. Finally, with the feature interactions, all information aggregates to the verb \"matched\", which gives us a better understanding of why the model makes the specific decision.\nReceptive Field The self-attention mechanism is supposed to have the ability to capture long-range dependencies. In order to better understand the layer-wise effective receptive field in Transformer, we plot the distance distribution of interactions extracted by the attribution tree. As shown in Figure 6, we observe that for the paired input of MNLI, the effective receptive field is relatively local in the first two layers and the 6-8th layers, while are more broad in the top three layers. For the single input of SST-2, the effective receptive field is monotonically increasing along with the layer number. Generally, the effective receptive field in the second layer is more restricted, while the latter layers extract more broad dependencies. Moreover, for pairwiseinput tasks (such as MNLI), the results indicate that Transformer models tend to first conduct local encoding and then learn to match between the pair of input sentences, which is different with training from scratch (Bao et al. 2019).", "publication_ref": ["b1"], "figure_ref": ["fig_4", "fig_4", "fig_4", "fig_4", "fig_4", "fig_5"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Use Case 3: Adversarial Attack", "text": "The model decision attributes more to the attention connections with larger attribution scores. We observe that the model tends to over-emphasize some individual patterns to make the prediction, while omitting most of the input. We then use the over-confident patterns as adversarial triggers (Wallace et al. 2019) to attack the BERT model.  Trigger Construction We extract the attention dependencies with the largest attribution scores across different layers (i.e., max L l=1 {a l i,j }) from the input, and employ these patterns as the adversarial triggers. During the attack, the adversarial triggers are inserted into the test input at the same relative position and segment as in the original sentence.\nThe specific attack process is shown in Figure 7. The two patterns \"floods-ice\" and \"Iowa-Florida\" contribute most to the prediction contradict in the source sentence. Next we employ them as the trigger to attack other examples, the model predictions flip from both neutral and entailment to contradict. Our attack method relies on attribution scores, which utilizes the gradient information, therefore it belongs to white-box non-targeted attacks.\nWe extract the dependencies with the largest attribution scores as the adversarial triggers from 3,000 input examples. Each trigger contains less than five tokens. The score of a trigger is defined as the maximum attribution value identified within it.

Specific to the NLP domain, Murdoch and Szlam (2017) introduce a decomposition method to track the word importance in LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997). Murdoch, Liu, and Yu (2018) extend the above method to contextual decomposition in order to capture the contributions of word combinations. Another strand of previous work generates the hierarchical explanations, which aims at revealing how the features are composed together (Jin et al. 2020;Chen, Zheng, and Ji 2020). However, they both detect interaction within contiguous chunk of input tokens. The attention mechanism (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) rises another line of work. The attention weights generated from the model indicate the dependency between two words intuitively, but Jain and Wallace (2019) and Serrano and Smith (2019) draw the same conclusion that they largely do not provide meaningful explanations for model predictions.
