{"title": "On the Progression of Situation Calculus Basic Action Theories: Resolving a 10-year-old Conjecture", "authors": "Stavros Vassos; Hector J Levesque", "pub_date": "", "abstract": "In a seminal paper, Lin and Reiter introduced a modeltheoretic definition for the progression of the initial knowledge base of a basic action theory. This definition comes with a strong negative result, namely that for certain kinds of action theories, first-order logic is not expressive enough to correctly characterize this form of progression, and secondorder axioms are necessary. However, Lin and Reiter also considered an alternative definition for progression which is always first-order definable. They conjectured that this alternative definition is incorrect in the sense that the progressed theory is too weak and may sometimes lose information. This conjecture, and the status of first-order definable progression, has remained open since then. In this paper we present two significant results about this alternative definition of progression. First, we prove the Lin and Reiter conjecture by presenting a case where the progressed theory indeed does lose information. Second, we prove that the alternative definition is nonetheless correct for reasoning about a large class of sentences, including some that quantify over situations. In this case the alternative definition is a preferred option due to its simplicity and the fact that it is always first-order.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The situation calculus is a logical language that is specially designed for reasoning about action and change (McCarthy & Hayes 1969). A basic action theory is a logical theory in the situation calculus that describes what holds initially in the world as well as how the world evolves under the effects of actions. An example of a basic action theory is one that captures the dynamics of a board game: part of the theory, the initial knowledge base, describes the initial positions of the pieces on the board, and the rest of the theory characterize the legal moves of the game and the effects (and noneffects) of performing those moves.\nA fundamental problem in reasoning about action and change is to determine whether or not some condition holds after a given sequence of actions has been performed. In other words, we start in an initial situation S 0 , we perform a sequence of actions \u03b1 taking us to a new situation S \u03b1 , and we wish to know if the condition holds in S \u03b1 . There are in fact two versions of this problem. The special case where the condition only refers to S \u03b1 is called the (simple) projection problem (Reiter 2001). For example, we might want to know if a game piece is at a certain location after move \u03b1. The more general case is where the condition may refer to situations in the future of S \u03b1 . For example, we might want to know if a game piece can ever get to a certain location after move \u03b1. This sort of reasoning, which we will call the generalized projection problem, is a prerequisite to other forms of reasoning in dynamic domains such as planning and high-level program execution (Reiter 1993).\nThe simple projection problem can be solved by regression or by progression (Lin 2007). Roughly speaking, regression involves taking the condition about S \u03b1 and transforming it to an equivalent one about S 0 where we can use the initial knowledge base to answer the question; progression, on the other hand, involves replacing the initial knowledge base in the basic action theory by a new knowledge base that captures the facts that hold in S \u03b1 .\nFor the generalized problem, where the condition may refer to the future of S \u03b1 , the case is less clear. There is no result for evaluating such conditions based on regression, and it is not clear if there is a practical definition for progression that is logically correct for this reasoning task.\nA model-theoretic definition of progression in the situation calculus that does the trick was first proposed by Lin and Reiter (1997). However, their definition, which we call LRprogression, comes with a strong negative result: for certain kinds of basic action theories, first-order logic is not expressive enough and second-order logic is needed. Nonetheless, their result did not preclude the possibility of other forms of progression that could still allow us to solve the generalized problem while remaining first-order definable. In particular, one possible candidate for the new knowledge base is the infinite set of all those first-order sentences about S \u03b1 that are entailed by the original basic action theory. We will call this second notion of progression FO-progression.\nWhile FO-progression clearly captures what holds in S \u03b1 , it is not clear that it is sufficient to characterize the future of S \u03b1 , even in combination with the rest of the basic action theory. Lin and Reiter conjectured that it was too weak. It has been an open problem whether this conjecture is true or false, rendering unclear also the question whether there can be an alternative to LR-progression that solves the generalized problem and is first-order definable.\nThis paper contains two major results. First of all, we prove the Lin and Reiter conjecture: FO-progression is indeed too weak for characterizing the future of S \u03b1 . We provide a basic action theory and a sentence about the future of S \u03b1 that demonstrate this. This result (Theorem 2) further supports the claim by Lin and Reiter that the progression of unrestricted basic action theories cannot be formalized correctly in first-order logic.\nThe second result is more positive. FO-progression was shown by Lin and Reiter (1997) to be correct for the simple projection problem. Here we prove that it is also correct for a much wider class of sentences including sentences of the form \"after \u03b1, property \u03c6 will always be true.\" This result (Theorem 4) establishes that FO-progression is actually more useful than was originally believed.", "publication_ref": ["b6", "b11", "b10", "b4", "b3", "b3"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Situation calculus", "text": "The language L of the situation calculus (McCarthy & Hayes 1969) is first-order with equality and many-sorted, with sorts for actions, situations, and objects (everything else). A situation represents a world history as a sequence of actions. The constant S 0 is used to denote the initial situation where no actions have occurred. Sequences of actions are built using the function symbol do, such that do(a, s) denotes the successor situation resulting from performing action a in situation s. A relational fluent is a predicate whose last argument is a situation, and thus whose value can change from situation to situation. For the scope of this paper we do not allow the language to include functional fluents but we note that they can be represented as relational fluents with some extra axioms. Actions need not be executable in all situations, and the predicate Poss(a, s) states that action a is executable in situation s. The language L also includes the binary predicate symbol which provides an ordering on situations. The atom s s means that the action sequence s can be obtained from the sequence s by performing one or more actions in s. We will typically use the notation \u03c3 \u03c3 as a macro for \u03c3 \u03c3 \u2228 \u03c3 = \u03c3 .\nOften we need to restrict our attention to sentences in L that refer to a particular situation. For example, the initial knowledge base is a finite set of sentences in L that do not mention any situation terms except for S 0 . For this purpose, for any situation term \u03c3, we define L \u03c3 to be the subset of L that does not mention any other situation terms except for \u03c3, does not mention Poss, and where \u03c3 is not used by any quantifier (Lin & Reiter 1997). When a formula \u03c6(\u03c3) is in L \u03c3 we say that it is uniform in \u03c3 (Reiter 2001). Also, we will use L 2 to denote the second-order extension of L that only allows predicate variables that take arguments of sort object. L 2 \u03c3 then denotes the second-order extension of L \u03c3 by predicate variables with arguments of sort object.\nWe will use notation similar to (Gabaldon 2002) and (Reiter 2001) to talk about sequences of actions and situations that are rooted. Let \u03c3 be a situation term and \u03b4 be a (possibly empty) sequence of action terms \u03b1 1 , . . . , \u03b1 n . We use do(\u03b4, \u03c3) to denote the situation do(\u03b1 n , do(\u03b1 n\u22121 , . . . do(\u03b1 1 , \u03c3) . . .)). We say that a situation term \u03c3 is rooted at \u03c3 iff \u03c3 is the term do(\u03b4, \u03c3 ) for some \u03b4 (in which case, \u03c3 \u03c3 clearly holds). Finally, we will use S \u03b1 to denote the situation term do(\u03b1, S 0 ).\nWe will also need to restrict our attention to sentences that refer to \u03c3 and the possible futures of \u03c3. We say that \u03c4 is in the future of \u03c3 in \u03c6, where \u03c6 is a rectified sentence in L, iff \u2022 \u03c4 is \u03c3, or \u2022 \u03c4 is rooted at some \u03c4 in the future of \u03c3 in \u03c6, or \u2022 \u03c4 is a variable and \u2200\u03c4 (\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2283 \u03b2) or \u2203\u03c4 (\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2227 \u03b2) appears in \u03c6, where \u03c4 is in the future of \u03c3 in \u03c6.\nWe define L F \u03c3 as the subset of L such that for any \u03c6 \u2208 L F \u03c3 the situation terms in \u03c6 that appear as arguments of Poss or some fluent or the equality predicate are all in the future of \u03c3 in \u03c6. When a sentence \u03c6 is in L F \u03c3 we say that \u03c6 is about the future of \u03c3.\nTo see the intuition behind L F \u03c3 first note that the sentence \u2200s(S \u03b1 s \u2283 \u03c6(s)) is in L F S\u03b1 and expresses that \u03c6(s) holds in all situations that are rooted at S \u03b1 . The recursion allows the sentence \u2200s(S \u03b1 s \u2283 \u03c6(s) \u2227 \u2203s (s s \u2227 \u03c8(s )) and sentences of this form to be in L F S\u03b1 as well. In general if a sentence is in L F \u03c3 then its truth depends only on situations that are in the future of \u03c3.", "publication_ref": ["b6", "b3", "b11", "b1", "b11"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Basic action theories", "text": "We will be dealing with a specific kind of L-theory, the socalled basic action theories.

It is typical in the literature to define D S\u03b1 as the progression of D S0 wrt a ground action \u03b1 and take D to be (D \u2212 D S0 ) \u222a D S\u03b1 . In other words, we want to replace D S0 in D by a suitable set of sentences D S\u03b1 satisfying the following (Reiter 2001): (I) Just as D S0 is a set of sentences in L S0 , the sentences of the new knowledge base D S\u03b1 should be uniform in S \u03b1 . (II) D and D should be equivalent wrt how they describe the situations in the future of S \u03b1 . Whenever D S\u03b1 satisfies these conditions we will say that the progression is correct. Lin and Reiter (1997) gave a model theoretic definition for D S\u03b1 that we call LR-progression. Here we review the definition that appears in (Reiter 2001) that is more compact. Definition 1. Let D be a basic action theory. A set of sentences D S\u03b1 is an LR-progression of D S0 wrt to ground action \u03b1 iff the following conditions hold: 1. D S\u03b1 is a set of sentences in By the conditions 2 and 3 in the definition it follows that for D and (D\u2212D S0 ) \u222a D S\u03b1 , any model of one is indistinguishable from some model of the other wrt how they interpret the situations in the future of S \u03b1 (Reiter 2001). Therefore LRprogression satisfies the condition (II). Moreover the condition 1 says that D S\u03b1 is a set of second-order sentences that are uniform in S \u03b1 . Therefore LR-progression also satisfies the condition (I) and thus it is correct. LR-progression comes with a strong negative result, namely that if we restrict D S\u03b1 to be first-order then an LR-progression does not always exist (Lin & Reiter 1997). Nonetheless, there is an alternative definition according to which a first-order D S\u03b1 always exists. The idea is to let D S\u03b1 be the infinite set of first-order entailments of D in L S\u03b1 (Pednault 1987). We call this second notion of progression FO-progression and to avoid confusion we will be using F S\u03b1 to refer to it. We introduce the following definition: 3 Definition 2. Let D be a basic action theory and F S\u03b1 be a set of sentences in L S\u03b1 . F S\u03b1 is an FO-progression of D wrt to ground action \u03b1 iff for all \u03c6 in L S\u03b1 ,\nL 2 S\u03b1 ; 2.

It has been open though whether it also satisfies the condition (II) since it was first formulated as a problem in (Lin & Reiter 1997). In fact, following intuitions and results in (Peppas, Foo, & Williams 1995) Lin and Reiter conjectured that there is a counter example that shows that FOprogression does not always satisfy the property (II). Here we state the conjecture in an equivalent way using the terminology that we introduced in this paper. Conjecture 1 (Lin and Reiter). There is a basic action theory D, a ground action \u03b1, and a sentence \u03c6 in\nL F S\u03b1 such that D |= \u03c6 but (D \u2212D S0 ) \u222a F S\u03b1 |= \u03c6,\nwhere D S0 is the initial knowledge base of D, and F S\u03b1 is an FO-progression of D S0 wrt a.", "publication_ref": ["b11", "b3", "b11", "b11", "b3", "b7", "b3", "b8"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "FO-progression is not correct for L F", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "S\u03b1", "text": "In this section we give a proof of Conjecture 1 thus resolving the open question whether FO-progression is correct. The proof is based on the notion of unnamed objects that we will be defining shortly. We will present a basic action theory D 1 , a ground action A, and a sentence \u03c6 * \u2208 L F S A , for which Conjecture 1 holds. We start by presenting D 1 and the intuitions behind its definition. Definition 3. Let L 1 be the situation calculus language that consists of a binary fluent symbol F , two constant action symbols A, B, a constant object symbol 0, and a unary function symbol n that takes an argument of sort object. Let D 1 be the basic action theory of L 1 that is defined as follows.\n\u2022 D ap consists of the sentence Poss(a, s) \u2261 true.\n\u2022 D ss consists of the following sentence:\nF (x, do(a, s)) \u2261 a = A \u2227 x = 0 \u2228 a = B \u2227 \u00acF (x, s) \u2227 \u2203y(x = n(y) \u2227 F (y, s)).\n(1)\n\u2022 D una consists of the sentence A = B.\n\u2022 D S0 consists of the following sentences:\n\u2200a(a = A \u2228 a = B) (2) \u2200x(x = 0 \u2261 \u2203y n(y) = x) (3) \u2200x\u2200y(n(x) = n(y) \u2283 x = y)(4)\nF (0, S 0 ) \u2227 \u2200x (F (x, S 0 ) \u2283 F (n(x), S 0 )) (5) \u2203x \u00acF (x, S 0 ) (6)\n\u2022 D fnd is the domain independent foundational axioms.\nD 1 was carefully defined so that all of its models satisfy two properties that we will take advantage in the sequel. Before we state the properties we need to introduce some notation. Observe that each of the ground terms of sort object in L 1 has the form n k (0), i.e. it is constructed by a finite number of applications of the function n to the constant 0.\nDefinition 4. Let GT be the set of all the ground terms of sort object in L and M be an L-structure. For every q in the object domain of M we will say that q is named iff there is a term t \u2208 GT such that t is interpreted as q, and unnamed otherwise. Also, we will say that M is a term structure iff all the elements of the object domain of M are named.\nThe first property of the models of D 1 is due to D S0 which can only be satisfied in models that have unnamed objects.\nLemma 1. No model of D 1 is a term structure.\nProof Sketch: The intuition is that the sentence ( 5) is satisfied only in a structure M where for all named objects q, M, \u00b5 x q |= F (x, S 0 ), while the sentence ( 6) is satisfied only in a structure M that has an element q in the object domain such that M, \u00b5 x q |= F (x, S 0 ). Therefore {( 5), (6)} can only be satisfied in a structure that has an unnamed object.\nThe second property is stated in the following lemma:\nLemma 2. Let M be a model of D 1 . For every action sequence \u03b4, M, \u00b5 x q |= F (x, do(\u03b4, S A )) iff q is the denotation of n k (0), where k is \u2022 the number 0, if the last action in \u03b4 is A;\n\u2022 the number of B actions that appear after the last occurrence of action A in A, \u03b4 , otherwise.\nProof Sketch: Consider the sentence (1), the successor state axiom for F . First note that in S A , F is false for all the elements of the object domain except for the denotation of 0. In do(B, S A ) then, F is false for all the elements of the object domain except for the denotation of n(0). This is because \u00acF (x, S A )\u2227\u2203y(x = n(y) \u2227 F (y, S A )) is true only for x = n(0) and y = 0. The formal proof is done by induction on the length of \u03b4 using a similar argument and the fact that the sentences (3), (4) in D S0 ensure that y and n(y) are different objects.\nWe now present the sentence \u03c6 * \u2208 L F S A that we will be using to prove the conjecture. Definition 5. Let \u03c6 * be \u2203x\u2200s(S A s \u2283 \u00acF (x, s)).\nFirst we show that by the two properties of D 1 that we identified earlier the following lemma holds for D 1 and \u03c6 * :\nLemma 3. D 1 |= \u03c6 * .\nProof Sketch: Consider a model M of D 1 . By Lemma 2 it follows that for every situation in the future of S A there can only be named objects for which F is true. By Lemma 1 it follows that there exists at least one unnamed object in the domain. Therefore there is an x such that F (x, s) can never be true in any situation in the future of S A , which implies that M |= \u2203x\u2200s(S A s \u2283 \u00acF (x, s)).", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Now we will proceed to show that", "text": "(D 1 \u2212D S0 ) \u222a F 1 |= \u03c6 * ,\nwhere F 1 is an FO-progression of D S0 wrt A. Definition 6. Let F 1 be the set {\u2200x(x = 0 \u2261 F (x, S A )), ( 2), ( 3), (4)}.\nIt is not difficult to show that, unlike D 1 , (D 1 \u2212D S0 )\u222aF 1 has a term model, in particular one that has the natural numbers as the domain for objects and interprets the constant symbol 0 as the number 0 and the function symbol n as the successor function.\nLemma 4. There is a model of (D 1 \u2212 D S0 ) \u222a F 1 that is a term structure.\nThe important point is that even though (D 1 \u2212D S0 ) \u222a F 1 fails to capture a property that D 1 has, namely that D 1 is not satisfied in any term structure, the next lemma shows that F 1 is in fact an FO-progression wrt to A.\nLemma 5. F 1 is an FO-progression of the initial knowledge base of D 1 wrt to ground action A.\nThe reason is that (D 1 \u2212D S0 )\u222aF 1 and D 1 entail the same set of sentences in L S A . The formal proof is long and tedious and involves model-theoretic techniques for constructing elementarily equivalent structures, such as the use of the upward Lowenheim-Skolem theorem.\nWe now show the last lemma we need in order to prove Conjecture 1.\nLemma 6. (D 1 \u2212D S0 ) \u222a F 1 |= \u03c6 * .\nProof Sketch: Consider the term model M of (D 1 \u2212D S0 )\u222aF 1 that we sketched for Lemma 4, where 0 is interpreted as the number zero and n k (0) is interpreted as k \u2208 N. Note that the property about F that is proven in Lemma 2 also holds for all the models of (D 1 \u2212 D S0 ) \u222a F 1 . It follows that for every x in the object domain there is a sequence of actions after which F (x, s) becomes true, which implies that M |= \u2200x\u2203s(S A s\u2227F (x, s)) or equivalently that M |= \u00ac\u03c6 * .\nThe next theorem establishes that the conjecture by Lin and Reiter is indeed true and thus closes the corresponding open question about the correctness of FO-progression.

In this section we show that it is nonetheless correct for addressing certain non-trivial reasoning problems. First, we review the result by Lin and Reiter (1997) that FO-progression is correct for addressing the (simple) projection problem.\nLemma 7. Let D be a basic action theory and F S\u03b1 be an FO-progression of D S0 wrt to ground action \u03b1. Then, for any sentence \u03c6(s) \u2208 L s and any situation term \u03c3 that is rooted at\nS \u03b1 , D |= \u03c6(\u03c3) iff (D\u2212D S0 ) \u222a F S\u03b1 |= \u03c6(\u03c3).\nThis result can be extended using the properties of regression. First, we define the set L R \u03c3 which is a generalization of the set of regressable sentences. Definition 7. A formula \u03c6 is in L R \u03c3 iff the following conditions hold:\n\u2022 every term of sort situation mentioned in \u03c6 is rooted at \u03c3; \u2022 \u03c6 does not quantify over situations; \u2022 \u03c6 does not mention the predicate symbol and it does not mention any equality atom built on situation terms. L R S0 is exactly the set of regressable sentences while L R \u03c3 is the subset of it that can also be regressed down to \u03c3. For example\nF (do(A, S 0 )) \u2227 G(do(B, S 0 )) is in L R S0 but not in L R S A , while F (do(A, S 0 )) \u2227 G(do(A, S 0 )) is in both.\nWe introduce a generalized regression operator R \u03c3 for formulas in L R \u03c3 . This operator works exactly the same as R(\u03c6) regressing atoms according to the precondition and successor state axioms in D, except that it only does so until a sentence uniform in \u03c3 is obtained. Like Theorem 1, two similar results can be obtained for R \u03c3 . Corollary 1. Let D be a basic action theory and \u03c6 be a sentence in\nL R \u03c3 . Then, R \u03c3 (\u03c6) is a sentence in L \u03c3 such that D |= \u03c6 iff D |= R \u03c3 (\u03c6).\nCorollary 2. Let D be a basic action theory, F S\u03b1 be a set of sentences in L S\u03b1 , and \u03c6 be a sentence in L R S\u03b1 , where \u03b1 is a ground action.\nThen, R S\u03b1 (\u03c6) is a sentence in L S\u03b1 such that (D\u2212D S0 ) \u222a F S\u03b1 |= \u03c6 iff F S\u03b1 \u222a D una |= R S\u03b1 (\u03c6).\nIt is easy then to extend Lemma 7 and show that an FOprogression is correct not only for reasoning about sentences in L \u03c3 but also for any sentence in L R S\u03b1 . Lemma 8. Let D be a basic action theory, F S\u03b1 be an FOprogression of D S0 wrt to ground action \u03b1, and \u03c6 be a sen-\ntence in L R S\u03b1 . Then, D |= \u03c6 iff (D\u2212D S0 ) \u222a F S\u03b1 |= \u03c6. Proof. By Corollary 1, R S\u03b1 (\u03c6) is in L S\u03b1 and D |= \u03c6 iff D |= R S\u03b1 (\u03c6). By Lemma 7, this holds iff (D\u2212D S0 )\u222aF S\u03b1 |= R S\u03b1 (\u03c6). By Corollary 2 and since D and (D\u2212D S0 ) \u222a F S\u03b1 share the same D ss , this holds iff (D\u2212D S0 ) \u222a F S\u03b1 |= \u03c6.\nWe will now show that an FO-progression is correct for a much wider class of sentences that may also quantify over situations. We extend L R \u03c3 as follows. Definition 8. Let \u03c3 be a situation term. L Q \u03c3 is the smallest set such that the following conditions hold:\n1. if \u03c6(s) \u2208 L R\ns then \u03c6(\u03c3) and \u2200s(\u03c3 s \u2283 \u03c6(s)) are in L Q \u03c3 ; 2. if \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 L Q \u03c3 then so are \u00ac\u03c6, \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8. L Q \u03c3 is the subset of L F \u03c3 that restricts the quantifiers for situation variables to appear only in sub-formulas of the form \u2200s(\u03c3 s \u2283 \u03c6(s)), where \u03c6(s) does not have free variables other than s. Consider, for instance, the set L Q S\u03b1 . The sentence \u03c6 * , that we used to show that FO-progression is not correct for L F \u03c3 , is an example of a sentence not in L Q S\u03b1 .\nNonetheless L Q S\u03b1 is quite large and includes many interesting cases, such as sentences expressing state invariants of the form \"after the execution of \u03b1 it is ensured that \u03c6(s) will always hold\" or \"after the execution of \u03b1 there is no way to achieve \u03c6(s)\", as well as boolean combinations of those.\nBefore we proceed to proving the main result of the section we need the following theorem. Theorem 3. Let D be a basic action theory, F S\u03b1 be an FOprogression of D S0 wrt ground action \u03b1, and C be a set of sentences in L. Let D be (D\u2212D S0 ) \u222a F S\u03b1 and assume that the following holds for D, D , C.\nLet M be a model of D and M be a model of D . If it holds that for all \u03c6 \u2208 L S\u03b1 , M |= \u03c6 iff M |= \u03c6, then it also holds that for all \u03c6 \u2208 C,\nM |= \u03c6 iff M |= \u03c6. Then, for all \u03c6 \u2208 C, D |= \u03c6 iff D |= \u03c6.\nThis theorem specifies a method for proving that an FOprogression is correct for a class of sentences C. Essentially it reduces the question about entailment (the two theories entail the same set of sentences in C, provided they entail the same set of sentences in L S\u03b1 ) to a simpler question about satisfaction (any two models of the theories satisfy the same set of sentences in C, provided they satisfy the same set of sentences in L S\u03b1 ). The proof is long and relies on the foundational result that D \u2212 D fnd is equivalent to D wrt the entailment of sentences uniform in some \u03c3 (Lin & Reiter 1997) and the Compactness Theorem of first-order logic.\nSo, in order to show that an FO-progression is correct for L Q\nS\u03b1 it suffices to prove the following lemma: S\u03b1 . The only interesting part is the base of the induction where we have two cases: i) \u03c6 is in L R S\u03b1 or ii) \u03c6 is \u2200s(S \u03b1 s \u2283 \u03c8(s)), where \u03c8(s) is in L R s . Case i) follows from Lemma 8. For case ii) we will use a trick to deal with the quantification over situations to reduce it to case i). We prove the (\u21d2) direction by contradiction and the other one follows similarly.   ", "publication_ref": ["b3", "b3"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Related and Future Work", "text": "Other people have looked into definitions for the progression of basic action theories under different assumptions. Liu and Levesque (2005) study the special case where the domain of discourse is fixed to a countable set of named objects, Cla\u00dfen and Lakemeyer (2006) focus on the ES variant of the situation calculus, and Thielscher (1999) defines a dual representation for the basic action theories based on state update axioms that explicitly define the direct effects of each action. In order for the progression to remain in first-order a special form is assumed for the structure of the basic action theory. This is in contrast to our line of work where we identify a class of sentences for which a first-order progression of an unrestricted theory is correct. A similar but much weaker result is due to Shirazi and Amir (2005). Shirazi and Amir prove that for those cases that progression is first-order definable, their variant of progression is correct for answering queries uniform in some situation term.\nWith respect to the proof for Conjecture 1, the notion of unnamed objects is also used in a different way in (Lin & Reiter 1997) to show that a first-order LR-progression does not always exist. Also, Theorem 4 shares intuitions with a result that appears in (Savelli 2006): whenever a basic action theory entails that there exists a situation satisfying a condition, at least one such situation must be found within a predetermined distance from the initial situation. The proof of this result relies on two ideas that we also used, namely the trick we used in the proof for Lemma 9 to deal with the quantification over situations, and the use of the Compactness Theorem for the proof of Theorem 3. The main difference is that we have separated the use of each of the ideas in such way that Theorem 3 and a different trick can be used to prove a result about progression under different assumptions. Finally, we note that Theorem 4 and the result in (Savelli 2006) also imply corresponding results about regression that we intend to investigate in future work.\nOur future work also focuses on the following. First, we intend to investigate when a finite FO-progression can be found. Note that an FO-progression is not necessarily an infinite set. The case of F 1 for the basic action D 1 is such an example. Second, we showed that an FO-progression is not correct unless we restrict our attention to a subset of the sentences about the future of S \u03b1 , namely the set L Q S\u03b1 . Nonetheless, depending on what kind of a basic action theory we consider, there are cases where FO-progression is correct for all the sentences about the future of S \u03b1 . As a special case note that when D S0 is empty, FO-progression is correct. 4 We want to identify practical cases where FOprogression can safely be used for all reasoning tasks. 4 Let FS \u03b1 be the empty set.

Moreover, we provided a general method for proving the correctness of the alternative definition that can be used under different assumptions.
