Toward this end, we present Marked Personas, a prompt-based method to measure stereotypes in LLMs for intersectional demographic groups without any lexicon or data labeling. Grounded in the sociolinguistic concept of markedness (which characterizes explicitly linguistically marked categories versus unmarked defaults), our proposed method is twofold: 1) prompting an LLM to generate personas, i.e., natural language descriptions, of the target demographic group alongside personas of unmarked, default groups; 2) identifying the words that significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain higher rates of racial stereotypes than human-written portrayals using the same prompts. The words distinguishing personas of marked (non-white, non-male) groups reflect patterns of othering and exoticizing these demographics. An intersectional lens further reveals tropes that dominate portrayals of marginalized groups, such as tropicalism and the hypersexualization of minoritized women. These representational harms have concerning implications for downstream applications like story generation.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "The persistence of social bias and stereotypes in large language models (LLMs) is well-documented (Dinan et al., 2020;Weidinger et al., 2021, inter alia). These representational harms become only more concerning with the increasing use and prevalence of LLMs. Existing methods to measure stereotypes in LLMs rely on manually-constructed datasets of either unnatural templates that measure stereotypical associations (Bolukbasi et al., 2016;Caliskan et al., 2017) or natural, human-written sentences that contain stereotypes (Nangia et al., 2020; As I look in the mirror, I see my rich, melanininfused skin glowing softly. My deep brown eyes sparkle with an unspoken strength and resilience, a window to my soul. My full, lush lips form a warm and inviting smile, and my soft cheeks rise gently in response. My hair, a riot of textured coils, frames my face in a gravitydefying halo. It dances to its own beat, wild and free, just like me. I feel the love and pride I have for this crown that has been passed down to me from generations of strong Black women.\nTable 1: Example of GPT-4-generated persona of a Black woman. Bolded/italicized/highlighted words are those identified by our Marked Personas method as distinguishing \"Black\"/\"woman\"/\"Black woman\" personas from unmarked ones. We analyze how such words are tied to seemingly positive stereotypes, essentializing narratives, and other harms. Nadeem et al., 2021). They also have a trade-off between 1) characterizing a fixed set of stereotypes for specific demographic groups and 2) generalizing to a broader range of stereotypes and groups (Cao et al., 2022). Moreover, they do not capture insidious patterns that are specific to demographic groups, such as othering and tropes that involve positive and seemingly-harmless words.\nTo address these shortcomings, we take an unsupervised, lexicon-free approach to measuring stereotypes in LMs. Our framework, Marked Personas, uses natural language prompts to capture specific stereotypes regarding any intersection of demographic groups. Marked Personas has two parts: Personas and Marked Words. First, we prompt an LLM to generate personas. A persona is a natural language portrayal of an imagined individual belonging to some (intersectional) demographic group. This approach is inspired by Kambhatla et al. (2022), in which the authors surface racial stereotypes by obtaining human-written responses to the same prompts that we use.\nUsing the same prompt enables us to compare rates of stereotypes in LLM-generated personas versus human-written ones and determine whether LLM portrayals are more stereotypical (Section 5). This comparison also reveals shortcomings of lexicon-based approaches, thus motivating our unsupervised Marked Words approach.\nTo identify whether and how LLMs portray marginalized groups in ways that differ from dominant ones, Marked Words is a method to characterize differences across personas and surface stereotypes present in these portrayals. It is grounded in the concept of markedness, which articulates the linguistic and social differences between the unmarked default group and marked groups that differ from the default. For instance, in English, \"man\" is used as the unmarked gender group while all other genders are marked (Waugh, 1982). Given texts for marked and unmarked groups, we identify the words that distinguish personas of marked groups from unmarked ones, which enables us to surface harmful patterns like stereotypes and essentializing narratives.\nRather than necessitating an extensive handcrafted dataset, lexicon, or other data labeling, our framework requires only specifying 1) the (possibly intersectional) demographic group of interest (e.g., Black woman) and 2) the corresponding unmarked default(s) for those axes of identity (e.g., white and man). This method is not limited by any existing corpus and can encompass many dimensions of identity. Thus, it is easily adaptable to studying patterns in LLM generations regarding any demographic group.\nOur method surfaces harmful patterns that are well-documented in the literature but overlooked by state-of-the-art measures of stereotypes in LLMs: in Section 6, we demonstrate how our method identifies previously-uncaptured patterns like those with positive and seemingly-harmless words. This reflects the prevalence of stereotypes that are positive in sentiment yet harmful to particular groups, such as gendered narratives of resilience and independence. We also discuss how replacing stereotypes with anti-stereotypes (such as the word independent, which we find only in generated portrayals of women) continues to reinforce existing norms. We also explore these patterns in downstream applications, such as LLM-generated stories, in Section 7. Toward mitigating these harms, we conclude with recommendations for LLM creators and researchers in Section 8. In summary, our main contributions are:\n1. the Marked Personas framework, which captures patterns and stereotypes across LLM outputs regarding any demographic group in an unsupervised manner, 2. the finding that personas generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 contain more stereotypes than human-written texts using the same prompts, and 3. an analysis of stereotypes, essentializing narratives, tropes, and other harmful patterns present in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 outputs that are identified by Marked Personas but not captured by existing measures of bias.\nThe dataset of generated personas and code to use Marked Personas and reproduce our results is at github.com/myracheng/markedpersonas.", "publication_ref": ["b29", "b12", "b15", "b69", "b68", "b16", "b47", "b96"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Background and Related Work", "text": "Our work is grounded in markedness, a concept originally referring to mentioning some grammatical features more explicitly than others; for example plural nouns in English are marked by ending with -s while singular nouns are unmarked (have no suffix). Markedness was extended to nongrammatical concepts by L\u00e9vi-Strauss (1963) and then to social categories such as gender and race by Waugh (1982), who noted that masculinity tends to be the unmarked default for gender and that in US texts, White people are typically referred to without mention of race, while non-Whites are often racially labeled (De Beauvoir, 1952;Liboiron, 2021;Cheryan and Markus, 2020, inter alia). Hence we use markedness to mean that those in dominant groups tend to be linguistically unmarked (i.e, referred to without extra explanation or modification) and assumed as the default, while non-dominant groups are marked (linguistically and socially) by their belonging to these groups. Markedness is thus inextricable from the power dynamics of white supremacy and patriarchy (Collins, 1990;Hooks, 2000, inter alia): stereotypes and perceptions of essential differences between minorities and the unmarked majority only further entrench these power differentials (Brekhus, 1998).\nIn line with previous work, we define stereotypes as traits that have been documented to be broadly associated with a demographic group in ways that reify existing social hierarchies (Deaux and Kite, 1993;Heilman, 2001;Caliskan et al., 2017;Blodgett et al., 2021;Weidinger et al., 2021). Various methods have been developed to measure social bias and stereotypes in large language models (Dinan et al., 2020;Nangia et al., 2020;Nadeem et al., 2021;Schick et al., 2021;Barikeri et al., 2021;Kirk et al., 2021;Smith et al., 2022;An et al., 2023, inter alia). Cao et al. (2022) compare these methods, finding that they satisfy at most 3 of 5 desiderata. Marked Personas improves upon these by satisfying 4 of the 5 desiderata: it generalizes to new demographic groups, is grounded in social science theory, uses natural-language LLM inputs, and captures specific stereotypes (Appendix A). We do not satisfy exhaustiveness: rather than exhaustively characterizing the full range of stereotypes, we characterizes dataset-specific patterns in portrayals of different demographics. Marked Personas enables us to capture specific stereotypes even as they are culturally dependent and constantly evolving (Madon et al., 2001;Eagly et al., 2020).\nMarked Personas also captures patterns for intersectional groups. Intersectionality refers to the notion that systems of oppression like sexism and racism are interrelated, and thus multifaceted social identities can be loci of compounding bias and unique harms (Collective, 1983;Ghavami and Peplau, 2013;Crenshaw, 2017). We build upon previous work on intersectional biases in word embeddings and LMs (Lepori, 2020;Guo and Caliskan, 2021;Cao et al., 2022), as well as for specific topics: May et al. (2019) examine intersectionality in toxicity tasks, while others have constructed measurements for the \"Angry Black Woman\" stereotype and occupational biases (Tan and Celis, 2019;Kirk et al., 2021).", "publication_ref": ["b52", "b96", "b26", "b22", "b14", "b27", "b39", "b15", "b9", "b29", "b69", "b68", "b86", "b7", "b49", "b88", "b16", "b59", "b30", "b21", "b35", "b24", "b51", "b37", "b16", "b61", "b91", "b49"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Methods", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Personas: Generating Intersectional Portrayals", "text": "To measure stereotypes in the open-ended generation setting, we prompt an LLM in the zero-shot setting using natural language prompts such as \"Imagine you are an Asian woman. Describe yourself.\" We refer to the output as a persona: a natural language portrayal of a specific individual whose identity belongs to a particular demographic group (in this case, an Asian woman). Our term \"persona\" draws upon the linguistics notion of \"persona\" as more malleable and constructed-in-the-moment than \"identity\" (Podesva et al., 2015) and on the HCI use of \"persona\" as a model of a hypothetical individual (Cooper, 1999;Blomkvist, 2002;Jettmar and Nass, 2002;Muller and Carey, 2002), and in NLP (Bamman et al., 2013;Huang et al., 2020;. Each generation portrays a single individual who may have a multifaceted social identity, which enables us to study how LLMs represent individuals who belong to any combination of identity groups. The full set of prompts is listed in Table A9. We vary our prompts by wording and length to robustly measure generated stereotypes. We analyze the outputs across the prompts in aggregate as we did not find statistically significant differences in distributions of top words across prompts.\nHuman-written Personas Our approach is inspired by Kambhatla et al. (2022), in which White and Black people across the United States were given the task to describe themselves both as their self-identified racial identity and an imagined one (prompts are in Table A10). The participants in the study are crowd-workers on the Prolific platform with average age 30. The authors analyze differences in stereotypes across four categories of responses: Self-Identified Black and Self-Identified White (\"Describe yourself\"), and Imagined Black and Imagined White (\"Imagine you are [race] and describe yourself\"). The authors find that among the four categories, Imagined Black portrayals contained the most stereotypes and generalizations. We use the same prompt, which enables comparison between the generated personas and the humanwritten responses in Section 5.", "publication_ref": ["b76", "b23", "b10", "b46", "b6", "b43", "b47"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Marked Words: Lexicon-Free Stereotype Measurement", "text": "Next, we present the Marked Words framework to capture differences across the persona portrayals of demographic groups, especially between marginalized and dominant groups. Marked Words surfaces stereotypes for marked groups by identifying the words that differentiate a particular intersectional group from the unmarked default. This approach is easily generalizable to any intersection of demographic categories.\nThe approach is as follows: first, we define the set of marked groups S that we want to evaluate as well as the corresponding unmarked group(s). Then, given the set of personas P s about a particular group s \u2208 S, we find words that statistically distinguish that group from an appropriate unmarked group (e.g., given the set P Asian woman , we find the words that distinguish it from P White and P man ). We use the Fightin' Words method of Monroe et al. (2008) with the informative Dirichlet prior, first computing the weighted log-odds ratios of the words between P s and corresponding sets of texts that represent each unmarked identity, using the other texts in the dataset as the prior distribution, and using the z-score to measure the statistical significance of these differences after controlling for variance in words' frequencies. Then, we take the intersection of words that are statistically significant (have z-score > 1.96) in distinguishing P s from each unmarked identity. This approach identifies words that differentiate (1) singular groups and (2) intersectional groups from corresponding unmarked groups. For (1) singular groups, such as race/ethnicity e \u2208 E (where E is the set of all race/ethnicities), we identify the words in P e whose log-odds ratios are statistically significant compared to the unmarked race/ethnicity P White . For (2) intersectional groups, such as gender-by-race/ethnic group eg \u2208 E \u00d7 G, we identify the words in P eg whose log-odds ratios are statistically significant compared to both the unmarked gender group P man and the unmarked race/ethnic group P White . This accounts for stereotypes and patterns that uniquely arise for personas at the intersections of social identity.\nWhile any socially powerful group may be the unmarked default, previous work has shown that in web data, whiteness and masculinity are unmarked (Bailey et al., 2022;Wolfe and Caliskan, 2022b), and that models trained on web data reproduce the American racial hierarchy and equate whiteness with American identity (Wolfe et al., 2022;Wolfe and Caliskan, 2022a). Thus, since we focus on English LLMs that reflect the demographics and norms of Internet-based datasets (Bender et al., 2021), we use White as the unmarked default for race/ethnicity, and man as the unmarked default for gender. We note that the meaning and status of social categories is context-dependent (Stoler et al., 1995;Sasson-Levy, 2013). We ground our work in the concept of markedness to enable examining other axes of identity and contexts/languages, as the Marked Personas method is broadly applicable to other settings with different defaults and categories.", "publication_ref": ["b66", "b5", "b100", "b98", "b99", "b8", "b90", "b83"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Robustness Checks: Other Measures", "text": "We use several other methods as robustness checks for the words surfaced by Marked Words.

(2022) to study the features that differentiate portrayals of Black versus White individuals. For this classification, we anonymize the data and then remove punctuation, capitalization, pronouns, and any descriptors that are explicit references to gender, race, or ethnicity using the list of holistic descriptions provided by Smith et al. (2022). We represent each persona p as a bag-of-words, i.e., a sparse vector of the relative frequencies of the words in p. Since every word is a feature in the classifier, this representation enables identifying the words with highest weight in the classification.\nJensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) Another way to identify words that differentiate sets of text is based on the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) (Trujillo et al., 2021).

Full results and discussions of differences among these models are in Appendix D.\nWhile our method is generalizable to any intersection of demographic groups, we focus on the categories used by Ghavami and Peplau (2013) to study stereotypes of intersectional demographics, and we build upon their work by also evaluating nonbinary gender. Thus, we focus on 5 races/ethnicities (Asian, Black, Latine, Middle-Eastern (ME), and White), 3 genders (man, woman, and nonbinary), and 15 gender-byrace/ethnic groups (for each race/ethnicity plus \"man\"/\"woman\"/\"nonbinary person\", e.g., Black man or Latina woman).\nWe generate 2700 personas in total: 90 (15 samples for each of the 6 prompts listed in Table A9) for each of the 15 gender-by-race/ethnic groups and for both models. See Table 2 for example generations. We compare these generated personas to human-written ones in Section 5.\nWe use Marked Words to find the words whose frequencies distinguish marked groups from unmarked ones across these axes in statistically significant ways (Table 3). As robustness checks, we compute top words for marked groups using JSD, as well as one-vs-all SVM classification across race/ethnic, gender, and gender-byrace/ethnic groups. For the SVMs, we split the personas into 80% training data and 20% test data, stratified based on demographic group. We find that descriptions of different demographic groups are easily differentiable from one another, as the SVMs achieve accuracy 0.96 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.92 \u00b1 0.04 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) on GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 personas respectively.

Based on the lexicons, generated personas contain more stereotypes than human-written ones. Between the GPT-4 personas, Black stereotypes are more prevalent in the Black personas, and White stereotypes are more prevalent in the White personas. For example, one GPT-4 \"basketball\" \"loud\" \"attitude\" \"athletic\" \"tall\" other words On the x-axis, lexicon words that do not occur in the generated personas (ghetto, unrefined, criminal, gangster, poor, unintelligent, uneducated, dangerous, vernacular, violent and lazy) are subsumed into \"other words.\" Generated personas contain more Blackstereotypical words, but only the ones that are nonnegative in sentiment.

If such phrases dominate Black personas while being absent in White ones, they further harmful, onedimensional narratives about Black people. Capturing these themes motivates our unsupervised Marked Personas framework. Also, note that in contrast to GPT-4, GPT-3.5 has a surprising result (Figure 1): generated White personas have higher rates of Black stereotype words than the generated Black personas. The positive words found in generated Black personas, such as tall and athletic, are also used in generated White personas (Figure 2). For example, a GPT-3.5 White persona starts with \"A white man is generally tall and athletic with fair skin and light hair.\" As So and Roland (2020) write, this inconsistency serves as a site of inquiry: What portrayals and stereotypes does this lexicon fail to capture? We explore these patterns by presenting and analyzing the results of Marked Personas.", "publication_ref": ["b89"], "figure_ref": ["fig_1", "fig_0", "fig_1"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Analyzing Marked Words: Pernicious Positive Portrayals", "text": "In this section, we provide qualitative analyses of the top words identified by Marked Personas (Table 3) and their implications. Broadly, these top words have positive word-level sentiment but reflect specific, problematic portrayals and stereotypes. We observe patterns of essentialism and othering, and we discuss the ways that the intersectional genderby-race/ethnic personas surface unique words that are not found in the gender-only or race/ethnic-only personas. The words construct an image of each particular gender-by-ethnic group that reproduce stereotypes, such as the \"strong, resilient Black woman\" archetype.\nSentiment and Positive Stereotyping While our method is sentiment-agnostic, the identified top words mostly seem positive in sentiment, perhaps due to OpenAI's bias mitigation efforts (see Appendix C for discussion of generating personas with negative sentiment). Indeed, we evaluate the sentiment of the generated personas using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer in NLTK, which assigns a scores to texts between \u22121 (negative) and +1 (positive), where 0 is neutral (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014). The GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 personas have average scores of 0.83 and 0.93 with standard deviations of 0.27 and 0.15 respectively. The average sentiment of words in Table 3 is 0.05 with standard deviation 0.14, and none of the words are negative in sentiment, i.e., have score < 0. Yet these positive-sentiment words nonetheless have dangerous implications when they are tied to legacies of harm: gender minorities often face workplace discrimination in the form of inappropriate \"compliments,\" while certain ethnic groups have been overlooked by equal opportunities programs (Czopp et al., 2015). Other works show how positive yet homogenous representations of ethnic and religious groups, while seeming to foster multiculturalism and antiracism, rely on the very logics that continue to enable systemic racism (Bonilla-Silva, 2006;Melamed, 2006;Alsultany, 2012). We will illustrate how seemingly positive words, from smooth to passionate, contribute to problematic narratives of marked groups and their intersections.\nAppearance Many of the words relate to appearance. We observe that the words for white groups are limited to more objective descriptors, and those for marked groups are descriptions that implicitly differentiate from the unmarked group: petite, colorful, and curvy are only meaningful with respect to the white norm. While the White personas con-   3: Top words for each group in generated personas. Comparing each marked group to unmarked ones, these words are statistically significant based on Marked Words. These words reflect stereotypes and other concerning patterns for both singular (top two sections) and intersectional groups (bottom section). Words for intersectional nonbinary groups are in Table A2. Highlighted words are significant for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, and black words are significant for GPT-4 only. Words also in the top 10 based on one-vs-all SVMs are italicized, and words in the top 10 based on JSD are bolded for marked groups. (Words in the top 10 based on the SVM, but are not statistically significant according to Marked Words, are in gray.) Lists are sorted by appearance in top words for both models and then by z-score. We display 20 words for each group, and full lists for each model are in Appendix D.\ntain distinct appearance words, such as blue, blond, light, and fair, these qualities have historically been idealized: Kardiner and Ovesey (1951) describe the \"White ideal\" of blonde hair, blue eyes and pale skin, which has been linked to white supremacist ideologies (Hoffman, 1995;Schafer et al., 2014;Gentry, 2022). Meanwhile, the appearance words describing minority groups are objectifying and dehumanizing. For example, personas of Asian women from all models are dominated by the words almondshaped, petite, and smooth. These words connect to representations of Asians, especially Asian women, in Western media as exotic, submissive, and hypersexualized (Chan, 1988;Zheng, 2016;Azhar et al., 2021). Such terms homogenize Asian individuals into a harmful image of docile obedience (Uchida, 1998).\nThe words distinguishing Latina women from unmarked groups include vibrant, curvaceous, rhythm and curves in GPT-4 personas. In GPT-3.5, vibrant also appears, and the top features from the SVM include passionate, brown, culture, spicy, colorful, dance, curves. These words correspond to tropicalism, a trope that includes elements like brown skin, bright colors, and rhythmic music to homogenize and hypersexualize this identity (Molina-Guzm\u00e1n, 2010;Martynuska, 2016). These patterns perpetuate representational harms to these intersectional groups.\nMarkedness, Essentialism and Othering The differences in the features demonstrate the markedness of LLM outputs: the words associated with unmarked, White GPT-3.5 personas include neutral, everyday descriptions, such as good (Table A5), while those associated with other groups tend not to (Table 3). Similarly, friendly and casually are top words for man personas. On the other hand, generated personas of marked groups reproduce problematic archetypes. Middle-Eastern personas disproportionately mention religion (faith, religious, headscarf ). This conflation of Middle-Eastern identity with religious piety-and specifically the conflation of Arab with Muslim-has been criticized by media scholars for dehumanizing and demonizing Middle-Eastern people as brutal religious fanatics (Muscati, 2002;Shaheen, 2003). Also, the words differentiating several marked race/ethnic groups from the default one (White) include culture, traditional, proud and heritage. These patterns align with previous findings that those in marked groups are defined primarily by their relationship to their demographic identity, which continues to set these groups apart in contrast to the default of whiteness (Frankenburg, 1993;Pierre, 2004;Lewis, 2004). Similarly, the words for nonbinary personas, such as gender, identity, norms, and expectations, exclusively focus on the portrayed individual's relationship to their gender identity. 2 The words for Middle-Eastern and Asian personas connect to critiques of Orientalism, a damaging depiction where the East (encompassing Asia and the Middle East) is represented as the \"ultimate Other\" against which Western culture is defined; inaccurate, romanticized representations of these cultures have historically been used as implicit justification for imperialism in these areas (Said, 1978;Ma, 2000;Yoshihara, 2002).\nBy pigeonholing particular demographic groups into specific narratives, the patterns in these generations homogenize these groups rather than characterizing the diversity within them. This reflects essentialism: individuals in these groups are defined solely by a limited, seemingly-fixed essential set of characteristics rather than their full humanity (Rosenblum and Travis, 1996;Woodward, 1997). Essentializing portrayals foster the othering of marked groups, further entrenching their difference from the default groups of society (Brekhus, 1998;Jensen, 2011;Dervin, 2012). Notions of essential differences contribute to negative beliefs about minority groups (Mindell, 2006) and serve as justification for the maintenance of existing power imbalances across social groups (Stoler et al., 1995 ", "publication_ref": ["b44", "b25", "b13", "b63", "b1", "b48", "b41", "b85", "b34", "b18", "b106", "b4", "b94", "b65", "b60", "b67", "b87", "b31", "b75", "b53", "b80", "b58", "b104", "b78", "b102", "b14", "b45", "b28", "b64", "b90"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_0", "tab_9"]}, {"heading": "% of Personas", "text": "Occurrences of \"Resilient\" and \"Resilience\" GPT-3.5 GPT-4\nFigure 3: Percentage of personas that contain resilient and resilience. Occurrences of resilient and resilience across generated personas reveal that these terms are primarily used in descriptions of Black women and other women of color. Groups where these words occur in < 10% of personas across models are subsumed into \"other groups.\" We observe similar trends for other models (Appendix D).\nThe Myth of Resilience Particular archetypes arise for intersectional groups. For instance, words like strength and resilient are significantly associated with non-white personas, especially Black women (Figure 3). These words construct personas of resilience against hardship. Such narratives reflect a broader phenomenon: the language of resilience has gained traction in recent decades as a solution to poverty, inequality, and other pervasive societal issues (Hicks, 2017;Allen, 2022). This language has been criticized for disproportionately harming women of color (McRobbie, 2020;Aniefuna et al., 2020)-yet it is these very genderby-ethnic groups whose descriptions contain the bulk of these words. This seemingly positive narrative has been associated with debilitating effects: the notion of the Strong Black Woman has been linked to psychological distress, poor health outcomes, and suicidal behaviors (Woods-Giscomb\u00e9, 2010;Nelson et al., 2016;Castelin and White, 2022). Rather than challenging the structures that necessitate \"strength\" and \"resilience,\" expecting individuals to have these qualities further normalizes the existence of the environments that fostered them (Rottenberg, 2014;Watson and Hunter, 2016;Liao et al., 2020).\nLimitations of Anti-stereotyping We notice that a small set of identified words seem to be explicitly anti-stereotypical: Only nonbinary groups, who have historically experienced debilitating repercussions for self-expression (Blumer et al., 2013;Hegarty et al., 2018), are portrayed with words like embrace and authentic. For GPT-3.5, top words include independent only for women personas (and especially Middle-Eastern women), and leader, powerful only for Black personas (Tables A5 and A6). We posit that these words might in fact result from bias mitigation mechanisms, as only portrayals of groups that have historically lacked power and independence contain words like powerful and independent, while portrayals of unmarked individuals are devoid of them. Such anti-stereotyping efforts may be interpreted through a Gricean lens (Grice, 1975) as flouting the Maxim of Relation: mentioning a historically lacking property only for the group that lacked it. By doing so, such conversations reinforce the essentializing narratives that define individuals from marginalized groups solely by their demographic.", "publication_ref": ["b40", "b0", "b62", "b3", "b101", "b70", "b17", "b79", "b95", "b55", "b11", "b38", "b36"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_9"]}, {"heading": "Downstream Applications: Stories", "text": "Popular use-cases for LLMs include creative generation and assisting users with creative writing (Parrish et al., 2022;Ouyang et al., 2022;.

We generate 30 stories for each of the 15 gender-by-race/ethnic group using the prompts in Table A14.\nUsing Marked Words on the stories, we find trends of essentializing narratives and stereotypes (Table A15): for unmarked groups, the only significant words beside explicit descriptors are neutral (town and shop). For marked groups, the significant words contain stereotypes, such as martial arts for stories about Asians-although not overtly negative, this is tied to representational harms (Chang and Kleiner, 2003;Reny and Manzano, 2016). The myth of resilience, whose harms we have discussed, is evidenced by words like determined, dreams, and worked hard defining stories about marked groups, especially women of color.

As LLMs increase in their sophistication and widespread use, our findings underscore the importance of the following directions.\nAddressing Positive Stereotypes and Essentializing Narratives Even if a word seems positive in sentiment, it may contribute to a harmful narrative. Thus, it is insufficient to replace negative language with positive language, as the latter is still imbued with potentially harmful societal context and affects, from perniciously positive words to essentializing narratives to flouting Gricean maxims. We have discussed how the essentializing narratives in LLM outputs perpetuate discrimination, dehumanization, and other harms; relatedly, Santurkar et al. (2023) also find that GPT-3.5's representations of demographic groups are largely homogenous. We recommend further study of these phenomena's societal implications as well as the alternative of critical refusal (Garcia et al., 2020): the model should recognize generating personas of demographic groups as impossible without relying on stereotypes and essentializing narratives that ostracize marked groups. Across the prompts and models that we tested, refusal is sometimes performed only by ChatGPT (Appendix D.3).\nAn Intersectional Lens Our analysis reveals that personas of intersectional groups contain distinctive stereotypes.

Or, some versions of GPT are trained using fine-tuning on human-written demonstrations and human-rated samples; on the rating rubric released by OpenAI, the closest criterion to stereotypes is \"Denigrates a protected class\" (Ouyang et al., 2022). Thus, positive stereotypes that are not overtly denigrating may have been overlooked with such criteria.

While our approach can be generalized to other contexts, our lexicon and qualitative analysis draw only upon American stereotypes, and we perform the analysis only on English. Beyond the five race/ethnicity and three gender groups we evaluate, there are many other demographic categories and identity markers that we do not yet explore.\nAnother limitation of our method is that it currently requires defining which identities are (un)marked a priori, rather than finding the default/unmarked class in an unsupervised manner. The prompts are marked with the desired demographic attribute, and every persona is produced with an explicit group label. Given these explicit labels, we then compare and analyze the results for marked vs. unmarked groups.\nA potential risk of our paper is that by studying harms to particular demographic groups, we reify these socially constructed categories.
