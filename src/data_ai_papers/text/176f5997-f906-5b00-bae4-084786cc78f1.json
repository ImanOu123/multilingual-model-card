Given a pair of entities in a text (e.g., sentence or document), the goal of RE is to discover the relationships between the entities expressed in the text. More specifically, we aim to extract triples from the text in the form of e h , r, e t where e h is a head entity, e t is a tail entity and r is a relationship between the entities.\nTo train a model for RE, we need a large volume of fully labeled training data in the form of text-triple pairs. Although human annotation provides high-quality labels to train the relation extraction models, it is difficult to produce a large-scale training data since manual labeling is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, Mintz et al. (2009) proposed distant supervision to automatically produce a large labeled data by using an external knowledge base (KB). For a text with a head entity e h and a tail entity e t , when a triple e h , r, e t exists in the KB for any relation type r, distant supervision produces a label e h , r, e t even though the relationship is not expressed in the text. Thus, it suffers from the wrong labeling problem. For instance, if a triple U K, capital, London is in the KB, distant supervision labels the triple even for the sentence 'London is the largest city of the UK'.\nAlthough each of the two labeling methods has a certain weakness, most of the existing works for RE utilize either human-annotated (HA) data or distantly supervised (DS) data. To take advantage of the high accuracy of human annotation and the cheap cost of distant supervision, we propose to effectively utilize a large DS data as well as a small amount of HA data. Since DS data is likely to have labeling bias, simply combining the two types of data to train a RE model may decrease the prediction accuracy. To take a close look at the labeling bias, let the inflation of a relation type be the ratio of the average frequencies of the relation type per text in DS data and HA data, respectively. We say that a relation type is unbiased if the average frequency of the relation type in DS data is the same as that in HA data (i.e., the inflation of the relation is 1). By examining a document-level RE dataset (DocRED) (Yao et al., 2019) with 96 relation types, we found that the inflations of the relation types are from 0.48 to 85.9. It indicates that distant supervision tends to generate a large number of false labels for some relation types.\nRecently,  introduced a domain adaptation approach to tackle the labeling bias problem for RE. It trains a RE model on DS data and adjusts the bias term of the output layer by using HA data. Although the bias adjustment achieves a meaningful accuracy improvement, it has a limitation. An underlying assumption of the method is that the labeling bias is static for every text since it adjusts the bias term only once after training and uses the same bias during the test time. However, the labeling bias varies depending on contextual information. For example, in DocRED dataset, most of the capital relation labeled by distant supervision are false positive. However, if the phrase 'is the capital city of' appears in the text, the label is likely to be a true label. Thus, we need to take account of contextual information to extract relations more accurately by considering the labeling bias.\nTo effectively utilize DS data and HA data for training RE models, we propose the dual supervision framework that can be applied to most existing RE models to achieve additional accuracy gain. Since the label distributions in HA data and DS data are quite different, we cast the task of training RE models with both data as a multi-task learning problem. Thus, we employ the two separate output modules HA-Net and DS-Net to predict the labels by human annotation and distant supervision, respectively, while previous works utilize a single output module. This allows the different predictions of the labels for human annotation and distant supervision, and thus it prevents the degradation of accuracy by incorrect labels in DS data. If we simply separate the prediction networks to apply the multi-task learning, HA-Net cannot learn from distantly supervised labels. To enable HA-Net to learn from DS data, we propose an additional loss term called disagreement penalty. It models the ratio of the output probabilities from the prediction networks HA-Net and DS-Net by using maximum likelihood estimation with log-normal distributions to generate the calibrated gradient to update HA-Net to effectively reflect distantly supervised labels. Furthermore, our framework exploits two additional networks \u00b5-Net and \u03c3-Net to adaptively estimate the log-normal distribution by considering contextual information. Moreover, we theoretically show that the disagreement penalty enables HA-Net to effectively utilize the labels generated by distant supervision. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the dual supervision framework on two types of tasks: sentencelevel and document-level REs. The experimental results confirm that our dual supervision framework significantly improves the prediction accuracy of existing RE models. In addition, the dual supervision framework substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art method  in both sentence-level and document-level REs with the relative F1 score improvement of up to 32%.", "publication_ref": ["b4", "b5", "b11", "b22", "b0", "b17", "b23"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Preliminaries", "text": "We present the problems of sentence-level and document-level relation extractions and next introduce existing works for relation extraction.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Problem Statement", "text": "Following the works (Yao et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2019), we assume that each text is annotated with entity mentions.

It is general enough to accommodate a variety of existing RE models to improve their accuracy. We can apply our framework to an existing RE model by using the feature encoder of the model and building the four sub-networks which exploit the structure of the original prediction network. Since our framework uses the feature encoder of the existing models, we briefly describe only the output layer here.\nUnlike the previous works, to allow the difference in the predictions for human annotated labels and distantly supervised labels, we exploit multi-task learning by employing two separate prediction networks HA-Net and DS-Net to predict the labels in HA data and DS data, respectively. We also use HA-Net to extract relations from the test data. The separation of the prediction networks prevents the accuracy degradation caused by incorrect labels from distant supervision. If we simply utilize two prediction networks to apply the multi-task learning, HA-Net cannot learn from distantly supervised labels although the prediction networks share the feature encoder. To enable HA-Net to learn from distantly supervised labels, we introduce an additional loss term called disagreement penalty. It models the disagreement between the outputs of HA-Net and DS-Net by using maximum likelihood estimation with log-normal distributions. Furthermore, to adaptively estimate the parameters of the log-normal distribution by considering contextual information, we exploit two parameter networks \u00b5-Net and \u03c3-Net.\nFor a label e h , r, e t , let I HA be an indicator variable that is 1 if the label is obtained by human annotation and 0 otherwise.

We use the prediction network of an existing model for both prediction networks of our framework without sharing the model parameters. The prediction networks HA-Net and DS-Net output the |R|-dimensional vectors p HA = [p(r 1 |e h , e t , HA), ... , p(r |R| |e h , e t , HA)] and p DS = [p(r 1 |e h , e t , DS), ... , p(r |R| |e h , e t , DS)], respectively, where p(r|e h , e t , HA) and p(r|e h , e t , DS) are the probabilities that there exists a label e h , r, e t , in HA data and DS data, respectively.

Moreover, the bias can vary depending on many other features such as the types of head and tail entities as well as the contents of a text. Thus, we propose to use an effective disagreement penalty to model the labeling bias depending on the context where the head and tail entities are located.   (Massey Jr, 1951) is widely used to determine whether an observed data is drawn from a given probability distribution, we used it to find the best-fit distribution of the inflations. Since the range of the inflation is [0, \u221e), we evaluated p-values of the four probability distributions supported on [0, \u221e): Log-normal, Weibull, chi-square and exponential distributions. In addition, we include the normal distribution as a baseline. Table 1 shows the result of K-S test for DocRED data. Note that a probability distribution has a high p-value if the probability distribution fits the data well. Since the log-normal distribution has the highest p-value, it is the best-fit distribution among the five probability distributions. Based on the observation, we model the disagreement penalty between the outputs of the two prediction networks.\nModeling the disagreement penalty. We develop the disagreement penalty based on the maximum likelihood estimation. Let X r be the random variable which denotes the ratio of p DS r to p HA r . Since the inflation is the ratio of the number of labels in DS data and HA data, the ratio p DS r /p HA r represents the conditional inflation of the relation type r conditioned on the text with head and tail entities. Thus, we assume that X r follows a log-normal distribution L(\u00b5 r , \u03c3 2 r ) whose probability density function is\nf (x) = 1 x\u03c3 r \u221a 2\u03c0 exp \u2212 (log x \u2212 \u00b5 r ) 2 2\u03c3 2 r .\n(2)\nThe disagreement penalty L DS-HA h,t is defined as the negative log likelihood of the conditional inflation p DS r /p HA r , which is obtained by substituting p DS r /p HA r into Equation (2) as follows:\n\u2212 log f p DS r /p HA r = 1 2 log p DS r \u2212 log p HA r \u2212 \u00b5 r \u03c3 r 2 + log p DS r \u2212 log p HA r + log \u03c3 r + log 2\u03c0 2 . (3) Since log 2\u03c0 2\nis constant, we utilize the disagreement penalty in Equation ( 3) without the constant term. If we set \u00b5 r and \u03c3 r to fixed values, we cannot effectively assess the conditional inflation since it can vary depending on the context. For example, although the inflation of the relation type capital is high, the conditional inflation should be lower if a particular phrase such as 'is the capital city of' appears in the text. To take account of the contextual information, we employ two additional networks \u00b5-Net and \u03c3-Net to estimate the \u00b5 r and \u03c3 r that are the parameters of log-normal distribution L(\u00b5 r , \u03c3 2 r ).", "publication_ref": ["b16"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_1"]}, {"heading": "Parameter Networks", "text": "The parameter networks \u00b5-Net and \u03c3-Net output the vectors \u00b5 = [\u00b5 1 , ..., \u00b5 |R| ] and \u03c3 = [\u03c3 1 , ..., \u03c3 |R| ], respectively, which are the parameters of the log-normal distributions to represent the conditional inflation for r \u2208 R. Both \u00b5-Net and \u03c3-Net have the same structure as those of the prediction networks except their output activation functions. For a log-normal distribution L(\u00b5, \u03c3), the parameter \u00b5 can be positive or negative, and \u03c3 is always positive. Thus, we use a hyperbolic tangent function and a softplus function (Dugas et al., 2001) as the output activation functions of \u00b5-Net and \u03c3-Net, respectively. For example, if the prediction network of the original RE model consists of a bilinear layer and an output activation function, the parameter vectors \u00b5 \u2208 R |R| and \u03c3 \u2208 R |R| are computed from the head entity vector h \u2208 R d and tail entity vector t \u2208 R d as\n\u00b5 = tanh(h W \u00b5 t + b \u00b5 ), \u03c3 = sof tplus(h W \u03c3 t + b \u03c3 ) + \u03b5\nwhere sof tplus(x) = log (1 + e x ) and \u03b5 is a sanity bound preventing extremely small values of \u03c3 r from dominating the loss function, and W \u00b5 \u2208 R d\u00d7|R|\u00d7d , W \u03c3 \u2208 R d\u00d7|R|\u00d7d , b \u00b5 \u2208 R |R| and b \u03c3 \u2208 R |R| are learnable parameters.

(2019) provide a document-level RE dataset (DocRED) as well as compare the models adapted from the sentence-level RE models (Zeng et al., 2014;Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997;Cai et al., 2016;Sorokin and Gurevych, 2017). Moreover, a fine tuned model (Wang et al., 2019) of BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) for document-level RE achieved a higher F1 score than the baselines on DocRED. The wrong labeling problem in distant supervision has been addressed in many previous works (Zeng et al., 2015;Lin et al., 2016;Ye and Ling, 2019;Beltagy et al., 2018). Among them, Zeng et al. (2015), Lin et al. (2016) and Ye and Ling (2019) build a bag-of-sentences for a pair of entities and extract relational facts from the bag-of-sentences with attention over the sentences. Beltagy et al. (2018) propose a bag-of-sentences-level model which utilizes human annotation. However, they use the human annotated labels only to determine whether there exists a relationship or not since the labels are obtained from a different domain. The goal of these works is different from ours which is to find the relations appearing in a given text (e.g., a document). Thus, the bag-of-sentences-level models have a limitation to be used for some applications such as question answering.\nThe most relevant work to ours is . This paper proposes the bias adjustment methods to utilize a small amount of HA data to improve RE models trained on DS data by considering the different distribution of human annotated labels and distantly supervised labels. However, they do not use HA data to train the models and use the HA data only to obtain a statistic to be used the determine the size of the bias adjustment. Thus, the bias adjustment methods cannot consider contextual information.", "publication_ref": ["b17", "b19", "b9", "b13", "b26", "b27", "b20", "b21", "b23", "b21", "b23", "b26", "b8", "b2", "b20", "b21", "b3", "b27", "b13", "b24", "b1", "b27", "b13", "b24", "b1"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We proposed the dual supervision framework to utilize human annotation and distant supervision based on the analysis of labeling bias in distant supervision. We devised a new structure for the output layer of RE models that consists of 4 sub networks. The new structure is robust to the noisy labeling of distant supervision since the labels obtained by human annotation and distant supervision are predicted by separate prediction networks HA-Net and DS-Net, respectively. In addition, we introduced an additional loss term called disagreement penalty which enables HA-Net to learn from distantly supervised labels. The parameter networks \u00b5-Net and \u03c3-Net adaptively assess the labeling bias by considering contextual information. Moreover, we theoretically analyzed the effect of the disagreement penalty. Our experiments showed that the dual supervision framework significantly outperforms the existing methods.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Appendix A Experimental Details", "text": "Our implementation is available at https://github.com/woohwanjung/dual.

For the other models, we followed the setting provided in (Yao et al., 2019): batch size is 40, learning rate is 10 \u22123 .
