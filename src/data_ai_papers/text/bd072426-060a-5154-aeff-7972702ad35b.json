Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of 10000 or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) x (t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix A, this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning A with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation 60\u00d7 faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors. 1", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "A central problem in sequence modeling is efficiently handling data that contains long-range dependencies (LRDs). Real-world time-series data often requires reasoning over tens of thousands of time steps, while few sequence models address even thousands of time steps. For instance, results from the long-range arena (LRA) benchmark [40] highlight that sequence models today perform poorly on LRD tasks, including one (Path-X) where no model performs better than random guessing.\nSince LRDs are perhaps the foremost challenge for sequence models, all standard model families such as continuous-time models (CTMs), RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers include many specialized variants designed to address them. Modern examples include orthogonal and Lipschitz RNNs [1,13] to combat vanishing gradients, dilated convolutions to increase context size [3,28], and an increasingly vast family of efficient Transformers that reduce the quadratic dependence on sequence length [8,22]. Despite being designed for LRDs, these solutions still perform poorly on challenging benchmarks such as LRA [40] or raw audio classification [18].\nAn alternative approach to LRDs was recently introduced based on the state space model (SSM) (Fig. 1). SSMs are a foundational scientific model used in fields such as control theory, computational neuroscience, and many more, but have not been applicable to deep learning for concrete theoretical reasons. In particular, Gu et al. [18] showed that deep SSMs actually struggle even on simple tasks, but can perform exceptionally (Center) Recent theory on continuous-time memorization derives special A matrices that allow SSMs to capture LRDs mathematically and empirically. (Right) SSMs can be computed either as a recurrence (left) or convolution (right). However, materializing these conceptual views requires utilizing different representations of its parameters (red, blue, green) which are very expensive to compute. S4 introduces a novel parameterization that efficiently swaps between these representations, allowing it to handle a wide range of tasks, be efficient at both training and inference, and excel at long sequences.\nwell when equipped with special state matrices A recently derived to solve a problem of continuous-time memorization [16,45]. Their Linear State Space Layer (LSSL) conceptually unifies the strengths of CTM, RNN and CNN models, and provides a proof of concept that deep SSMs can address LRDs in principle.\nUnfortunately, the LSSL is infeasible to use in practice because of prohibitive computation and memory requirements induced by the state representation. For state dimension N and sequence length L, computing the latent state requires O(N 2 L) operations and O(N L) space -compared to a \u2126(L + N ) lower bound for both. Thus for reasonably sized models (e.g. N = 256 in Gu et al. [18]), the LSSL uses orders of magnitude more memory than comparably-sized RNNs or CNNs. Although theoretically efficient algorithms for the LSSL were proposed, we show that these are numerically unstable. In particular, the special A matrix is highly non-normal in the linear algebraic sense, which prevents the application of conventional algorithmic techniques. Consequently, although the LSSL showed that SSMs have strong performance, they are currently computationally impractical as a general sequence modeling solution.\nIn this work, we introduce the Structured State Space (S4) sequence model based on the SSM that solves the critical computational bottleneck in previous work. Technically, S4 reparameterizes the structured state matrices A appearing in Gu et al. [16], Voelker et al. [45] by decomposing them as the sum of a low-rank and normal term. Additionally, instead of expanding the standard SSM in coefficient space, we compute its truncated generating function in frequency space, which can be simplified into a multipole-like evaluation. Combining these two ideas, we show that the low-rank term can be corrected by the Woodbury identity while the normal term can be diagonalized stably, ultimately reducing to a well-studied and theoretically stable Cauchy kernel [29,30]. This results in\u00d5(N + L) computation and O(N + L) memory usage, which is essentially tight for sequence models. Compared to the LSSL, S4 is up to 30\u00d7 faster with 400\u00d7 less memory usage, while exceeding the LSSL's performance empirically.\nEmpirically, S4 significantly advances the state-of-the-art for LRD. On the LRA benchmark for efficient sequence models, S4 is as fast as all baselines while outperforming them by 20+ points on average. S4 is the first model to solve the difficult LRA Path-X task (length-16384), achieving 88% accuracy compared to 50% random guessing for all prior work. On speech classification with length-16000 sequences, S4 halves the test error (1.7%) of specialized Speech CNNs -by contrast, all RNN and Transformer baselines fail to learn (\u2265 70% error).\nTowards a general-purpose sequence model. Beyond LRD, a broad goal of machine learning is to develop a single model that can be used across a wide range of problems. Models today are typically specialized to solve problems from a particular domain (e.g. images, audio, text, time-series), and enable a narrow range of capabilities (e.g. efficient training, fast generation, handling irregularly sampled data). This specialization is typically expressed via domain-specific preprocessing, inductive biases, and architectures. Sequence models provide a general framework for solving many of these problems with reduced specialization -e.g. Vision Transformers for image classification with less 2D information [12]. However, most models such as Transformers generally still require substantial specialization per task to achieve high performance.\nDeep SSMs in particular have conceptual strengths that suggest they may be promising as a general sequence modeling solution. These strengths include a principled approach to handling LRDs, as well as the ability to move between continuous-time, convolutional, and recurrent model representations, each with distinct capabilities (Fig. 1). Our technical contributions enable SSMs to be applied successfully to a varied set of benchmarks with minimal modification:\n\u2022 Large-scale generative modeling. On CIFAR-10 density estimation, S4 is competitive with the best autoregressive models (2.85 bits per dim). On WikiText-103 language modeling, S4 substantially closes the gap to Transformers (within 0.8 perplexity), setting SoTA for attention-free models.\n\u2022 Fast autoregressive generation. Like RNNs, S4 can use its latent state to perform 60\u00d7 faster pixel/token generation than standard autoregressive models on CIFAR-10 and WikiText-103.\n\u2022 Sampling resolution change. Like specialized CTMs, S4 can adapt to changes in time-series sampling frequency without retraining, e.g. at 0.5\u00d7 frequency on speech classification.\n\u2022 Learning with weaker inductive biases. With no architectural changes, S4 surpasses Speech CNNs on speech classification, outperforms the specialized Informer model on time-series forecasting problems, and matches a 2-D ResNet on sequential CIFAR with over 90% accuracy.\n2 Background: State Spaces ", "publication_ref": ["b39", "b0", "b12", "b2", "b27", "b7", "b21", "b39", "b17", "b17", "b15", "b44", "b17", "b15", "b44", "b28", "b29", "b11"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0", "fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "State Space Models: A Continuous-time Latent State Model", "text": "The state space model is defined by the simple equation (1).

Intuitively, one explanation is that linear first-order ODEs solve to an exponential function, and thus may suffer from gradients scaling exponentially in the sequence length (i.e., the vanishing/exploding gradients problem [32]). To address this problem, the LSSL leveraged the HiPPO theory of continuous-time memorization [16]. HiPPO specifies a class of certain matrices A \u2208 R N \u00d7N that when incorporated into (1), allows the state x(t) to memorize the history of the input u(t). The most important matrix in this class is defined by equation ( 2), which we will call the HiPPO matrix. For example, the LSSL found that simply modifying an SSM from a random matrix A to equation (2) improved its performance on the sequential MNIST benchmark from 60% to 98%.\n(HiPPO Matrix)\nA nk = \u2212 \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 (2n + 1) 1/2 (2k + 1) 1/2 if n > k n + 1 if n = k 0 if n < k .(2)", "publication_ref": ["b31", "b15"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Discrete-time SSM: The Recurrent Representation", "text": "To be applied on a discrete input sequence (u 0 , u 1 , . . . ) instead of continuous function u(t), (1) must be discretized by a step size \u2206 that represents the resolution of the input.

Section 3.1 motivates our approach, which is based on the linear algebraic concepts of conjugation and diagonalization, and discusses why the naive application of this approach does not work.

Therefore these compute the exact same operator u \u2192 y, but with a change of basis by V in the state x.\nLemma 3.1 motivates putting A into a canonical form by conjugation 2 , which is ideally more structured and allows faster computation. For example, if A were diagonal, the resulting computations become much more tractable. In particular, the desired K (equation ( 4)) would be a Vandermonde product which theoretically only needs O((N + L) log 2 (N + L)) arithmetic operations [29].\nUnfortunately, the naive application of diagonalization does not work due to numerical issues. Werive the explicit diagonalization for the HiPPO matrix (2) and show it has entries exponentially large in the state size N , rendering the diagonalization numerically infeasible (e.g. CV in Lemma 3.1 would not be computable). We note that Gu et al. [18] proposed a different (unimplemented) algorithm to compute K faster than the naive algorithm.

However, this class of matrices is restrictive; in particular, it does not contain the HiPPO matrix (2).\nWe make the observation that although the HiPPO matrix is not normal, it can be decomposed as the sum of a normal and low-rank matrix. However, this is still not useful by itself: unlike a diagonal matrix, powering up this sum (in ( 5)) is still slow and not easily optimized.

Theorems 2 and 3 describe the complexities of SSMs where A is in DPLR form. S4 is optimal or near-optimal for both recurrent and convolutional representations.\nTheorem 2 (S4 Recurrence). Given any step size \u2206, computing one step of the recurrence (3) can be done in O(N ) operations where N is the state size.\nTheorem 2 follows from the fact that the inverse of a DPLR matrix is also DPLR (e.g. also by the Woodbury identity). This implies that the discretized matrix A is the product of two DPLR matrices and thus has O(N ) matrix-vector multiplication. Appendix C.2 computes A in closed DPLR form. Appendix C, Definition 3 formally defines Cauchy matrices, which are related to rational interpolation problems. Computing with Cauchy matrices is an extremely well-studied problem in numerical analysis, with both fast arithmetic and numerical algorithms based on the famous Fast Multipole Method (FMM) [29,30,31]. The computational complexities of these algorithms under various settings are described in Appendix C, Proposition 5.\nWe reiterate that Theorem 3 is our core technical contribution, and its algorithm is the very motivation of the NPLR S4 parameterization. This algorithm is formally sketched in Algorithm 1. Concretely, an S4 layer is parameterized as follows. First initialize a SSM with A set to the HiPPO matrix (2). By Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 1, this SSM is unitarily equivalent to some (\u039b \u2212 P Q * , B, C) for some diagonal \u039b and vectors P , Q, B, C \u2208 C N \u00d71 . These comprise S4's 5N trainable parameters.\nThe overall deep neural network (DNN) architecture of S4 is similar to prior work. As defined above, S4 defines a map from R L \u2192 R L , i.e. a 1-D sequence map. Typically, DNNs operate on feature maps of size H instead of 1. S4 handles multiple features by simply defining H independent copies of itself, and then mixing the H features with a position-wise linear layer for a total of O(H 2 ) + O(HN ) parameters per layer. Nonlinear activation functions are also inserted between these layers. Overall, S4 defines a sequence-to-sequence map of shape (batch size, sequence length, hidden dimension), exactly the same as related sequence models such as Transformers, RNNs, and CNNs.\nNote that the core S4 module is a linear transformation, but the addition of non-linear transformations through the depth of the network makes the overall deep SSM non-linear. This is analogous to a vanilla CNN, since convolutional layers are also linear. The broadcasting across H hidden features described in this section is also analogous to depthwise-separable convolutions. Thus, the overall deep S4 model is closely related to a depthwise-separable CNN but with global convolution kernels.\nFinally, we note that follow-up work found that this version of S4 can sometimes suffer from numerical instabilities when the A matrix has eigenvalues on the right half-plane [14]. It introduced a slight change to the NPLR parameterization for S4 from \u039b \u2212 P Q * to \u039b \u2212 P P * that corrects this potential problem.

Our goal in this section is to validate that S4 achieves high performance on difficult tasks that require long-range reasoning. We focus here on two problems: (i) the Long-Range Arena, a well-known benchmark designed to test efficient sequence models on LRDs, and (ii) a speech classification problem as a real-world test of LRDs.\nLong Range Arena (LRA). LRA [40] contains 6 tasks with lengths 1K-16K steps, encompassing modalities and objectives that require similarity, structural, and visuospatial reasoning. Table 4 compares S4 against the 11 Transformer variants from Tay et al. [40] as well as follow-up work. S4 substantially advances the SoTA, outperforming all baselines on all tasks and averaging 80.48% compared to less than 60% for every baseline. Notably, S4 solves the Path-X task, an extremely challenging task that involves reasoning about LRDs over sequences of length 128 \u00d7 128 = 16384. All previous models have failed (i.e. random guessing) due to memory or computation bottlenecks, or simply being unable to learn such long dependencies.\nWe analyze S4's performance on Path-X by visualizing its learned representations, in particular 1-D convolution kernels K which are the focus of our technical results in Section 3. Fig. 2 shows that S4 learns a variety of filters that display spatially consistent structure and demonstrate awareness of the 2-D nature of the data. In particular, the lower layers learn simple kernels that extract features from just a few rows of local context while ignoring the rest of the image. On the other hand, higher layers aggregate information globally across full columns of the image at varying spatial frequencies. Filters in these higher layers span the entire context (16384 pixels), confirming S4's ability to learn LRDs.\nRaw Speech Classification. Speech is a typical real-world time series domain, involving signals sampled from an underlying physical process at high frequency. We perform speech classification using the SC10 subset of the Speech Commands dataset [47] (see Appendix D.5). While most sequence models for speech rely on extensive preprocessing (e.g. to MFCC features), we classify raw speech (length-16000) following Romero et al. [35]. S4 achieves 98.3% accuracy, higher than all baselines that use the 100\u00d7 shorter MFCC features, and validates that a powerful LRD model is able to extract more information from the raw data and outperform hand-crafted pre-processing. Additionally, we include a baseline CNN specifically designed for raw speech, the discriminator from the WaveGAN model [11], which performs worse than S4 while having 90\u00d7 more parameters and incorporating many more architectural heuristics (Appendix D.2).", "publication_ref": ["b39", "b39", "b46", "b34", "b10"], "figure_ref": ["fig_1"], "table_ref": ["tab_4"]}, {"heading": "S4 as a General Sequence Model", "text": "A key goal of sequence modeling research is to develop a single model that can be applied in many domains (e.g. images, audio, text, time-series) with a broad range of capabilities (e.g. efficient training, fast generation, handling irregularly sampled data). As a fundamental scientific model, SSMs are a promising candidate that come with a range of capabilities, and S4's strong results on LRD benchmarks spanning images, text, and speech are evidence of S4's potential as a general sequence model. In this section, we focus on understanding this question in more depth by highlighting key strengths of S4 in settings that usually require specialized    models. The tasks we focus on (generative modeling, image classification, time-series forecasting) are considered as LRD tasks in the literature, and serve as additional validation that S4 handles LRDs efficiently.\nLarge-scale generative modeling. We investigate two well-studied image and text benchmarks to validate the scalability, flexibility, and efficiency of S4. These tasks require much larger models than our previous tasks -up to 250M parameters.\nFirst, CIFAR density estimation is a popular benchmark for autoregressive models, where images are flattened into a sequence of 3072 RGB subpixels that are predicted one by one. Table 7 shows that with no 2D inductive bias, S4 is competitive with the best models designed for this task.\nSecond, WikiText-103 is an established benchmark for language modeling, an important task for large-scale sequence models where tokens are predicted sequentially based on past context. Although RNNs were the model of choice for many years, Transformers are now the dominant model in such applications that contain data that is inherently discrete. We show that alternative models to Transformers can still be competitive in these settings. By simply taking a strong Transformer baseline [2] and replacing the self-attention layers, S4 substantially closes the gap to Transformers (within 0.8 ppl), setting SoTA for attention-free models by over 2 ppl.\nFast autoregressive inference. A prominent limitation of autoregressive models is inference speed (e.g. generation), since they require a pass over the full context for every new sample. Several methods have been specifically crafted to overcome this limitation such as the Linear Transformer, a hybrid Transformer/RNN that switches to a stateful, recurrent view at inference time for speed.\nAs a stateful model, SSMs automatically have this ability (Fig. 1). By switching to its recurrent representation (Section 2.3), S4 requires constant memory and computation per time step -in contrast to standard autoregressive models which scale in the context length. On both CIFAR-10 and WikiText-103, we report the throughput of various models at generation time, with S4 around 60\u00d7 faster than a vanilla Transformer on both tasks (details in Appendix D.3.3).", "publication_ref": ["b1"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": ["tab_7"]}, {"heading": "Sampling resolution change.", "text": "As a continuous-time model, S4 automatically adapts to data sampled at different rates, a challenging setting for time series with a dedicated line of work [10,35,37].

Beyond our results on speech (Section 4.2), we further validate that S4 can be applied with minimal modifications on two domains that typically require specialized domainspecific preprocessing and architectures. First, we compare S4 to the Informer [50], a new Transformer architecture that uses a complex encoder-decoder designed for time-series forecasting problems. A simple application of S4 that treats forecasting as a masked sequence-to-sequence transformation (Fig. 5) outperforms the Informer and other baselines on 40/50 settings across 5 forecasting tasks. Notably, S4 is better on the longest setting in each task, e.g. reducing MSE by 37% when forecasting 30 days of weather data (Table 9).\nFinally, we evaluate S4 on pixel-level sequential image classification tasks (Table 6), popular benchmarks which were originally LRD tests for RNNs [1]. Beyond LRDs, these benchmarks point to a recent effort of the ML community to solve vision problems with reduced domain knowledge, in the spirit of models such as Vision Transformers [12] and MLP-Mixer [41] which involve patch-based models that without 2-D inductive bias. Sequential CIFAR is a particularly challenging dataset where outside of SSMs, all sequence models have a gap of over 25% to a simple 2-D CNN. By contrast, S4 is competitive with a larger ResNet18 (7.9M vs. 11.0M parameters), both with (93.16% vs. 95.62%) or without (91.12% vs. 89.46%) data augmentation. Moreover, it is much more robust to other architectural choices (e.g. 90.46% vs. 79.52% when swapping BatchNorm for LayerNorm).", "publication_ref": ["b9", "b34", "b36", "b49", "b0", "b11", "b40"], "figure_ref": ["fig_10"], "table_ref": ["tab_5", "tab_9", "tab_6"]}, {"heading": "SSM Ablations: the Importance of HiPPO", "text": "A critical motivation of S4 was the use of the HiPPO matrices to initialize an SSM. We consider several simplifications of S4 to ablate the importance of each of these components, including: (i) how important is the HiPPO initialization? (ii) how important is training the SSM on top of HiPPO? (iii) are the benefits of S4 captured by the NPLR parameterization without HiPPO?\nAs a simple testbed, all experiments in this section were performed on the sequential CIFAR-10 task, whicih we found transferred well to other settings. Models were constrained to at most 100K trainable parameters and trained with a simple plateau learning rate scheduler and no regularization.\nUnconstrained SSMs. We first investigate generic SSMs with various initializations. We consider a random Gaussian initialization (with variance scaled down until it did not NaN), and the HiPPO initialization.\nWe also consider a random diagonal Gaussian matrix as a potential structured method; parameterizing A as a diagonal matrix would allow substantial speedups without going through the complexity of S4's NPLR parameterization. We consider both freezing the A matrix and training it. Second, a large generalization gap exists between the initializations. In particular, note that when A is trained, all initializations are able to reach perfect training accuracy. However, their validation accuracies are separated by over 15%.\nNPLR SSMs. The previous experiment validates the importance of HiPPO in SSMs. This was the main motivation of the NPLR algorithm in S4, which utilizes structure of the HiPPO matrix (2) to make SSMs computationally feasible. Fig. 4a shows that random NPLR matrices still do not perform well, which validates that S4's effectiveness primarily comes from the HiPPO initialization, not the NPLR parameterization.\nFinally, Fig. 4b considers the main ablations considered in this section (with trainable SSMs) and adds minor regularization. With 0.1 Dropout, the same trends still hold, and the HiPPO initialization-in other words, the full S4 method-achieves 84.27% test accuracy with just 100K parameters.

Our work is most closely related to a line of work originally motivated by a particular biologically-inspired SSM, which led to mathematical models for addressing LRDs. Voelker et al. [45], Voelker [46] derived a non-trainable SSM motivated from approximating a neuromorphic spiking model, and Chilkuri and Eliasmith [7] showed that it could be sped up at train time with a convolutional view. Gu et al. [16] extended this special case to a general continuous-time function approximation framework with several more special cases of A matrices designed for long-range dependencies. However, instead of using a true SSM, all of these works fixed a choice of A and built RNNs around it. Most recently, Gu et al. [18] used the full (1) explicitly as a deep SSM model, exploring new conceptual views of SSMs, as well as allowing A to be trained.\nAs mentioned in Section 1, their method used a naive instantiation of SSMs that suffered from an additional factor of N in memory and N 2 in computation.\nBeyond this work, our technical contributions (Section 3) on the S4 parameterization and algorithms are applicable to a broader family of SSMs including these investigated in prior works, and our techniques for working with these models may be of independent interest.\nImplementation. The computational core of S4's training algorithm is the Cauchy kernel discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 and Appendix C.3. As described in Appendix C.3 Proposition 5, there are many algorithms for it with differing computational complexities and sophistication. Our current implementation of S4 actually uses the naive O(N L) algorithm which is easily parallelized on GPUs and has more easily accessible libraries allowing it to be implemented; we leverage the pykeops library for memory-efficient kernel operations. However, this library is a much more general library that may not be optimized for the Cauchy kernels used here, and we believe that a dedicated CUDA implementation can be more efficient. Additionally, as discussed in this work, there are asymptotically faster and numerically stable algorithms for the Cauchy kernel (Proposition 5). However, these algorithms are currently not implemented for GPUs due to a lack of previous applications that require them. We believe that more efficient implementations of these self-contained computational kernels are possible, and that S4 (and SSMs at large) may have significant room for further improvements in efficiency.\nLimitations and Future Directions. In this work, we show that S4 can address a wide variety of data effectively. However, it may not necessarily be the most suitable model for all types of data. For example, Table 8 still found a gap compared to Transformers for language modeling. An interesting future direction is exploring combinations of S4 with other sequence models to complement their strengths. We are excited about other directions, including continuing to explore the benefits of S4 on audio data (e.g. pre-training or generation settings), and generalizing HiPPO and S4 to higher-dimensional data for image and video applications.", "publication_ref": ["b44", "b45", "b6", "b15", "b17"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_8"]}, {"heading": "B Numerical Instability of LSSL", "text": "This section proves the claims made in Section 3.1 about prior work.

For all datasets, we used the AdamW optimizer with a constant learning rate schedule with decay on validation plateau. However, the learning rate on HiPPO parameters (in particular \u039b, P , Q, B, C, \u2206) were reduced to a maximum starting LR of 0.001, which improves stability since the HiPPO equation is crucial to performance.\nThe S4 state size was always fixed to N = 64.\nAs S4 is a sequence-to-sequence model with output shape (batch, length, dimension) and LRA tasks are classification, mean pooling along the length dimension was applied after the last layer.\nWe note that most of these results were trained for far longer than what was necessary to achieve SotA results (e.g., the Image task reaches SotA in 1 epoch). Results often keep improving with longer training times.\nUpdated results. The above hyperparameters describe the results reported in the original paper, shown in Table 10, which have since been improved. See Appendix D.5.\nHardware. All models were run on single GPU.

Speech Commands We provide details of sweeps run for baseline methods run by us-numbers for all others method are taken from Gu et al. [18].

We used 8 attention heads, model dimension 128, prenorm, positional encodings, and trained for 150 epochs with a batch size of 100. For Raw, the Transformer model's memory usage made training impossible.\nPerformer [8] For MFCC, we swept the number of model layers {2, 4}, dropout {0, 0.1} and learning rates {0.001, 0.0005}. We used 8 attention heads, model dimension 128, prenorm, positional encodings, and trained for 150 epochs with a batch size of 100. For Raw, we used a model dimension of 128, 4 attention heads, prenorm, and a batch size of 16. We reduced the number of model layers to 4, so the model would fit on the single GPU. We trained for 100 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001 and no dropout.\nExpRNN [24] For MFCC, we swept hidden sizes {256, 512} and learning rates {0.001, 0.002, 0.0005}. Training was run for 200 epochs, with a single layer model using a batch size of 100. For Raw, we swept hidden sizes {32, 64} and learning rates {0.001, 0.0005} (however, ExpRNN failed to learn).\nLipschitzRNN [13] For MFCC, we swept hidden sizes {256, 512} and learning rates {0.001, 0.002, 0.0005}. Training was run for 150 epochs, with a single layer model using a batch size of 100.

The base model had B = 8 with starting hidden dimension 128, while the large model had B = 16 with starting hidden dimension 192.\nWe experimented with both the mixture of logistics from [39] as well as a simpler 256-way categorical loss.

The model consists of 16 blocks of S4 layers alternated with position-wise feedforward layers, with a feature dimension of 1024. Because our S4 layer has around 1/4 the number of parameters as a self-attention layer with the same dimension, we made two modifications to match the parameter count better: (i) we used a GLU activation after the S4 linear layer (Section 3.4) (ii) we used two S4 layers per block. Blocks use Layer Normalization in the pre-norm position.\nThe embedding and softmax layers were the Adaptive Embedding from [2] with standard cutoffs 20000, 40000, 200000.\nEvaluation was performed similarly to the basic setting in [2], Table 5, which uses sliding non-overlapping windows. Other settings are reported in [2] that include more context at training and evaluation time and improves the score. Because such evaluation protocols are orthogonal to the basic model, we do not consider them and report the base score from [2] Table 5.\nInstead of SGD+Momentum with multiple cosine learning rate annealing cycles, our S4 model was trained with the simpler AdamW optimizer with a single cosine learning rate cycle with a maximum of 800000 steps.
