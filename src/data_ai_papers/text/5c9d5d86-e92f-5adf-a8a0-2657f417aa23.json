However, targeting specific groups also carries the risk of reflecting disparate social norms and subtle stereotypes. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which how-to guides from one particular platform, wikiHow, differ in practice depending on the intended audience. We conduct two case studies in which we examine qualitative features of texts written for specific audiences. In a generalization study, we investigate which differences can also be systematically demonstrated using computational methods. The results of our studies show that guides from wikiHow, like other text genres, are subject to subtle biases. We aim to raise awareness of these inequalities as a first step to addressing them in future work.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "How-to guides provide practical instructions that help humans to achieve specific goals. In the past decades, such guides also attracted increasing interest in NLP and AI research (Branavan et al., 2009;Chu et al., 2017;. Resources such as wikiHow, 1 a collaboratively edited online platform for instructional texts, make it possible to scale research efforts to hundreds of thousands of articles. By covering an ever-increasing number of guides, including niche topics and articles for minority groups, there is also an increasing risk of perpetuating stereotypes and jeopardizing general accessibility. In fact, we notice that wikiHow already contains articles written for specific target groups as well as articles that exist in different versions for different audiences. As an example, Table 1 shows two articles with the same title, \"Act Like a Kid Again\", one with the indicator '(Girls)' and one with '(Boys)'.\n1 www.wikihow.com Act Like a Kid Again (Girls) Eat well and exercise, but don't obsess about your body. Be healthy without stressing too much about it. (. . . ) Generally, go for lots of fruits and veggies. And even though kids love sugar, don't eat too much of it! Act Like a Kid Again (Boys) Eat your childhood favorite food. Recollect every snack, chocolates, ice cream, candy bars, cotton candy and everything that you loved as a kid or would make you feel pampered. Eat as per your capacity as too much at once may make you feel uncomfortable. Among other things, we find that such articles dramatically differ in terms of details. For example, the texts highlighted in Table 1 vary in how much they focus on issues potentially related to body images. As such, the articles reflect disparate standards, which ultimately may contribute to discrimination (Prentice and Carranza, 2002). The specific example can also be linked to observations of gender differences in weight concerns from psychology (Dougherty et al., 2022), which might represent a reason for disparate treatment. On the surface, it is not always possible to say exactly why there are certain differences in articles for specific audiences. However, through qualitative and quantitative comparisons on the linguistic level, we can at least determine what types of differences are present and to what extent they can be systematically identified. In this sense, we aim to contribute to questions about biases and fairness in data and, at the same time, connect to related research in psychology and other social sciences.\nThere already exists a large body of research that examines biases and stereotypes in NLP data and, likewise, how-to guides from wikiHow have been used as training material for a variety of language processing tasks ( \u00a72). However, previous studies have not explicitly looked into issues related to bias in the wikiHow data. As a first step towards addressing this gap, we create our own sub-corpora of how-to guides, which let us investigate differences across articles for specific target groups ( \u00a73).\nWe perform two case studies and a generalization study on our collected data: In the first study, we identify a number of articles that exist in multiple variants for different target groups and examine them in terms of distinctive content and linguistic characteristics ( \u00a74). As a second case study, we explicitly examine how far topics covered for specific target groups differ from each other ( \u00a75). Finally, we investigate whether the qualitative findings from our case studies can be validated quantitatively and generalized to our whole corpus using computational modeling ( \u00a76).\nIn summary, we find systematic differences between articles for specific groups in terms of topic, style, and content. We conclude the paper with a discussion of these findings and point out links to existing work in the social sciences ( \u00a77).", "publication_ref": ["b8", "b13", "b29", "b16"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_0", "tab_0"]}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "We summarize existing work on the three strains of research that this paper builds on: wikiHow as a data source ( \u00a72.1), subtle biases in datasets ( \u00a72.2), as well as understanding the characteristics of texts that target specific audiences ( \u00a72.3).", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "wikiHow as a Data Source", "text": "wikiHow is a prominent data source for a variety of tasks, including summarization (Koupaee and Wang, 2018), goal-step inference (Zhang et al., 2020), and question answering (Cai et al., 2022).

The need for clarification stands prominently out as a main purpose of the refinements of wikiHow guides (Bhat et al., 2020).

This work contributes to the research on subtle biases, i.e., textual patterns that implicitly reflect societal power asymmetries. Such biases are embeded in specific linguistic phenomena (e.g., masculine generics; Swim et al., 2004) or in inequalities in how people from different demographic groups are represented (e.g., emphasizing the romantic relationships in the bibliographies of women; Wagner et al., 2015). Moreover, they can be frequent even in domains where blatant stereotypes and openly expressing beliefs about social hierarchies is generally considered inappropriate (Cervone et al., 2021). For example, there is a long line of work analyzing subtle stereotypes in Wikipedia (Callahan and Herring, 2011;Reagle and Rhue, 2011;Konieczny and Klein, 2018;Schmahl et al., 2020, among others), where the lack of diversity represents an issue already at the level of the editors' community (Lam et al., 2011). Beyond notability for representation itself, linguistic aspects in Wikipedia show a remarkable disparity concerning biographies of men and women, both in terms of topics and polarity of abstract terminology (Wagner et al., 2016). Such inequalities do not pertain only to biographies but find systemic correspondence in all domains and across languages (Falenska and \u00c7etinoglu, 2021).\nTo the best of our knowledge, the presence of subtle stereotypes in wikiHow has not yet been investigated. However, the guides from this platform are a valuable entry point for studying bias, as they are produced by a community of contributors and by experts 2 suggesting how to perform activities. In other words, given the different purposes of the platforms, while Wikipedia data is rather descriptive, wikiHow data features instructional texts that potentially differ depending on the audience.", "publication_ref": ["b41", "b43", "b11", "b10", "b30", "b23", "b25", "b44", "b18"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Different Audiences", "text": "The mind of the readers features a priori goals that affect the understanding of written texts (Fum et al., 1986).

In that work, less expert readers were found to be tentatively more influenced by effective titles. Consequently, a system for revising titles accounting for the readers' expertise has been proposed (Senda et al., 2004). As such, that contribution indicates the importance of considering the target audience for efficient communication. Additionally, different audiences can understand to different extents technical terminology (Senda et al., 2006;Elhadad and Sutaria, 2007) and causation (Siddharthan and Katsos, 2010).

In general, each guide consists of multiple revisions of an article, a fixed goal that is named in the title, and (optionally) an indicator that follows the title in parentheses (cf. Table 1). As we are interested in how-to guides for different target groups, we filter the data for indicators that specify a group of people as targets, which we also refer to as the audience. Table 2 lists the 20 most frequent indicators extracted from wikiHowToImprove.\nBased on a manual grouping of these indicators, we find that 15 out of 20 indicators refer to attributes of performative gender and age (the remaining five are underlined in Table 2). Apart from their high frequency, both of these attributes are of interest to studies in the social sciences, in which they are often used as independent variables (Cortina et al., 2013;Cha and Weeden, 2014;Pal\u00e8ncia et al., 2014). Following a traditional binary setup, we distinguish two audiences based on gender, women (W) and men (M), and two audiences based on age, kids (K) and teens (T). 3 For each type of audience, 3 Note that while the selected audiences follow discrete   we create a set of all indicators used and collect all corresponding guides by extracting the latest article versions from wikiHowToImprove. Statistics of our corpus with audience-specific how-to guides are provided in Table 3. We note that there is a much higher number of indicators and articles for W than for M. In comparison, the number of articles and indicators for K and T are similar. With only 2,112 how-to guides in total, the corpus seems relatively small. However, the average length of articles ranges from 352 to 682 words, which adds up to a corpus size of more than one million words.

We start by manually investigating titles of the filtered pairs of guides. For this purpose, we assign each of them to one of three content-related categories. The categories were designed to cover all the titles while being as concrete as possible. An overview of all the categories and their examples is listed in Table 4. We find that W-M instructions cover a relatively wide range of topics, from body-related activities (BODY), over interacting with other people (INTERACT), to self-presentation (PRESENT), which is the most frequent category. In contrast, among titles in K-T, we notice one clear pattern: all topics focus on issues that require different steps depending on the age of the target. Among them, we distinguish and report in ascending order of frequency articles about learning how to do activities for grown-ups or concerning the urge to grow old (GROWN-UP), advice related to the life of young people (ADVICE), and activities about oneself or the relation of oneself to others (ACTIVITY).\nLength. Next, we check whether there are significant differences in terms of how detailed the instructions are for different target groups. We quantify this by simply measuring the length per article in words and sentences. We notice a considerable difference between K and T: the median length of articles for K is only 30 sentences and 346 words, while articles for T contain 98 sentences and 1081 words. In the case of W and M, we do not find such large differences in terms of average word (785 vs. 856) and sentence counts (59 vs. 62). Overall, the numbers reflect the patterns shown in Table 3 for the whole wikiHowAudiences data.\nContent. Finally, we switch our attention to the actual content of the articles. As a simple measure of how similar two guides are, we consider their word overlap in both directions using BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002).\nTable 5 presents the articles with the lowest and highest word overlap in both analyzed groups. Interestingly in the case of W-M, both articles cover concepts related to BODY, namely clearing skin and recognizing an infection. Manual inspection of their content reveals that even in the case of the least overlapping articles, \"Get Clear Skin\", slight differences can be noticed: W article includes more specific information as well as different usage of punctuation. In the case of most overlapping articles, \"Recognize Chlamydia Symptoms\", the main difference comes from the vocabulary related to different body parts from body types. The high word overlap of these two versions is likely related to their introductions, which provide an interchangeable overview to the topic.\nIn the case of K-T, the least and most overlapping articles come from two different categories: ACTIVITY and GROWN-UP. The least overlapping pair, \"Flirt\", is a case of two instructions that treat the same goal with different levels of complexity. For example, the matter of eye contact is described with one step in K and more than ten in T. The most overlapping articles, \"Make Money\", can be an example of a content stalemate -for both target audiences, babysitting is the first suggested activity to achieve the profit goal. However, it is possible to notice differences in how this concept is contextualized for two groups: either in a list of activities or discussed with its implications and advantages. There are the traditional jobs like babysitting, shoveling snow, and doing chores around the house.\nT Make eye contact. Body language is a big part of flirting, and a big part of that is eye contact. Eye contact conveys intimacy (...)\nBabysit for friends and family.

Interestingly, we also see characteristics of gender-inclusive language ('theirs' for M) and direct address of the reader in terms of their group membership ('kid' for K and 'teen' for T). We further find negations (e.g., 'wasn't') as part of strong features for W, which is particularly worrying in light of sociopsychological findings that have shown negations to serve a stereotype-maintaining function across languages (Beukeboom et al., 2010(Beukeboom et al., , 2020.", "publication_ref": ["b6", "b5"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_15"]}, {"heading": "Same title articles.", "text": "As examples of particularly hard cases, we return to the how-to guides from the first case study, which consisted of article versions for different audiences ( \u00a74).

In the construction of sub-corpora for four target groups, we already noticed inequalities on the level of who is being instructed in wikiHow: as a target audience, women are mentioned more than four times more frequently than men, and teens receive about 50% more instructions per article than kids. In two case studies, we investigated and provided examples of target-related differences on the levels of topic, style, and content. The differences observed in our case studies inspired feature sets of shallow classifiers for predicting the target audience of a given guide. Using these classifiers, we showed that it is, in many cases, indeed possible to automatically predict for which audience an article was written. In an analysis of our results, we found that this success is not merely based on different topics covered for each target group but that the articles for each group systematically differ in terms of content and style.\nEach of the aforementioned observations presents a tiny, seemingly insignificant piece of a puzzle. But taken together, these pieces reveal a surprisingly clear picture: there are noticeable differences in what topics are covered for each target group, how many articles and instructions are provided for each audience, and how these articles are written. Even though the audience-specific characteristics used in our studies are by no means exhaustive, our straightforward approach allowed us to identify, qualitatively and quantitatively, debatable differences in how wikiHow guides present particular topics to specific target groups. While there is an inevitable need for differences in vocabulary when speaking about physical features or body parts, it is at best unclear in which ways how-to guides about human interactions or selfpresentation should cast significant differences. Some of the observed differences have already been critically discussed in the context of social science research. For example, it is well-known that labels such as 'cute' are used pejoratively as a form of social control (Talbot, 2019) and that prescriptive components of gender stereotypes in education contribute to discrimination (Kollmayer et al., 2018). However, exposing readers to cultural messages and beliefs about age, gender or other factors cannot be avoided entirely, especially on a collaboratively edited online platform. In fact, it seems to be a challenge for any pluralistic society to find a balance between communicating traditional values and empowering everyone. It is therefore all the more important for a comprehensive understanding to determine when and in what form social norms are conveyed.
