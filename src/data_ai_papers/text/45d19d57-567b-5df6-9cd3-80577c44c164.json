However, learning high quality representations can be challenging. They should ideally model both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy). In this paper, we introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that directly addresses both challenges, can be easily integrated into existing models, and significantly improves the state of the art in every considered case across a range of challenging language understanding problems.\nOur representations differ from traditional word type embeddings in that each token is assigned a representation that is a function of the entire input sentence. We use vectors derived from a bidirectional LSTM that is trained with a coupled lan-guage model (LM) objective on a large text corpus. For this reason, we call them ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) representations. Unlike previous approaches for learning contextualized word vectors (Peters et al., 2017;McCann et al., 2017), ELMo representations are deep, in the sense that they are a function of all of the internal layers of the biLM. More specifically, we learn a linear combination of the vectors stacked above each input word for each end task, which markedly improves performance over just using the top LSTM layer.\nCombining the internal states in this manner allows for very rich word representations. Using intrinsic evaluations, we show that the higher-level LSTM states capture context-dependent aspects of word meaning (e.g., they can be used without modification to perform well on supervised word sense disambiguation tasks) while lowerlevel states model aspects of syntax (e.g., they can be used to do part-of-speech tagging). Simultaneously exposing all of these signals is highly beneficial, allowing the learned models select the types of semi-supervision that are most useful for each end task.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ELMo representations work extremely well in practice. We first show that they can be easily added to existing models for six diverse and challenging language understanding problems, including textual entailment, question answering and sentiment analysis. The addition of ELMo representations alone significantly improves the state of the art in every case, including up to 20% relative error reductions. For tasks where direct comparisons are possible, ELMo outperforms CoVe (McCann et al., 2017), which computes contextualized representations using a neural machine translation encoder. Finally, an analysis of both ELMo and CoVe reveals that deep representations outperform those derived from just the top layer of an LSTM. Our trained models and code are publicly available, and we expect that ELMo will provide similar gains for many other NLP problems. 1", "publication_ref": ["b35", "b40", "b41", "b31", "b31"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Related work", "text": "Due to their ability to capture syntactic and semantic information of words from large scale unlabeled text, pretrained word vectors (Turian et al., 2010;Mikolov et al., 2013;Pennington et al., 2014) are a standard component of most state-ofthe-art NLP architectures, including for question answering , textual entailment (Chen et al., 2017) and semantic role labeling . However, these approaches for learning word vectors only allow a single contextindependent representation for each word.\nPreviously proposed methods overcome some of the shortcomings of traditional word vectors by either enriching them with subword information (e.g., Wieting et al., 2016;Bojanowski et al., 2017) or learning separate vectors for each word sense (e.g., Neelakantan et al., 2014). Our approach also benefits from subword units through the use of character convolutions, and we seamlessly incorporate multi-sense information into downstream tasks without explicitly training to predict predefined sense classes.\nOther recent work has also focused on learning context-dependent representations. context2vec (Melamud et al., 2016) uses a bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to encode the context around a pivot word. Other approaches for learning contextual embeddings include the pivot word itself in the representation and are computed with the encoder of either a supervised neural machine translation (MT) system (CoVe;McCann et al., 2017) or an unsupervised language model (Peters et al., 2017). Both of these approaches benefit from large datasets, although the MT approach is limited by the size of parallel corpora. In this paper, we take full advantage of access to plentiful monolingual data, and train our biLM on a corpus with approximately 30 million sentences (Chelba et al., 2014). We also generalize these approaches to deep contextual representations, which we show work well across a broad range of diverse NLP tasks.\n1 http://allennlp.org/elmo Previous work has also shown that different layers of deep biRNNs encode different types of information. For example, introducing multi-task syntactic supervision (e.g., part-of-speech tags) at the lower levels of a deep LSTM can improve overall performance of higher level tasks such as dependency parsing (Hashimoto et al., 2017) or CCG super tagging (S\u00f8gaard and Goldberg, 2016). In an RNN-based encoder-decoder machine translation system, Belinkov et al. (2017) showed that the representations learned at the first layer in a 2layer LSTM encoder are better at predicting POS tags then second layer. Finally, the top layer of an LSTM for encoding word context (Melamud et al., 2016) has been shown to learn representations of word sense. We show that similar signals are also induced by the modified language model objective of our ELMo representations, and it can be very beneficial to learn models for downstream tasks that mix these different types of semi-supervision. Dai and Le (2015) and Ramachandran et al. (2017) pretrain encoder-decoder pairs using language models and sequence autoencoders and then fine tune with task specific supervision.

The top layer LSTM output, ! h LM k,L , is used to predict the next token t k+1 with a Softmax layer.\nA backward LM is similar to a forward LM, except it runs over the sequence in reverse, predicting the previous token given the future context:\np(t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t N ) = N Y k=1 p(t k | t k+1 , t k+2 , . . . , t N ).\nIt can be implemented in an analogous way to a forward LM, with each backward LSTM layer j in a L layer deep model producing representations h LM k,j of t k given (t k+1 , . . . , t N ).\nA biLM combines both a forward and backward LM.

Most supervised NLP models share a common architecture at the lowest layers, allowing us to add ELMo in a consistent, unified manner. Given a sequence of tokens (t 1 , . . . , t N ), it is standard to form a context-independent token representation x k for each token position using pre-trained word embeddings and optionally character-based representations. Then, the model forms a context-sensitive representation h k , typically using either bidirectional RNNs, CNNs, or feed forward networks.\nTo add ELMo to the supervised model, we first freeze the weights of the biLM and then Finally, we found it beneficial to add a moderate amount of dropout to ELMo (Srivastava et al., 2014) and in some cases to regularize the ELMo weights by adding kwk 2 2 to the loss.

(2017) highlighted the importance of using biLMs over forward-only LMs and large scale training.\nTo balance overall language model perplexity with model size and computational requirements for downstream tasks while maintaining a purely character-based input representation, we halved all embedding and hidden dimensions from the single best model CNN-BIG-LSTM in J\u00f3zefowicz et al. (2016). The final model uses L = 2 biLSTM layers with 4096 units and 512 dimension projections and a residual connection from the first to second layer. The context insensitive type representation uses 2048 character n-gram convolutional filters followed by two highway layers (Srivastava et al., 2015) and a linear projection down to a 512 representation. As a result, the biLM provides three layers of representations for each input token, including those outside the training set due to the purely character input. In contrast, traditional word embedding methods only provide one layer of representation for tokens in a fixed vocabulary.\nAfter training for 10 epochs on the 1B Word Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2014), the average forward and backward perplexities is 39.7, compared to 30.0 for the forward CNN-BIG-LSTM. Generally, we found the forward and backward perplexities to be approximately equal, with the backward value slightly lower.\nOnce pretrained, the biLM can compute representations for any task. In some cases, fine tuning the biLM on domain specific data leads to significant drops in perplexity and an increase in downstream task performance. This can be seen as a type of domain transfer for the biLM. As a result, in most cases we used a fine-tuned biLM in the downstream task.

In the remainder of this section we provide high-level sketches of the individual task results; see the supplemental material for full experimental details.\nQuestion answering The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) contains 100K+ crowd sourced questionanswer pairs where the answer is a span in a given Wikipedia paragraph. Our baseline model (Clark and Gardner, 2017) is an improved version of the Bidirectional Attention Flow model in Seo et al. (BiDAF;. It adds a self-attention layer after the bidirectional attention component, simplifies some of the pooling operations and substitutes the LSTMs for gated recurrent units (GRUs; Cho et al., 2014). After adding ELMo to the baseline model, test set F 1 improved by 4.7% from 81.1% to 85.8%, a 24.9% relative error reduction over the baseline, and improving the overall single model state-of-the-art by 1.4%. A 11 member ensemble pushes F 1 to 87.4, the overall state-of-the-art at time of submission to the leaderboard. 2 The increase of 4.7% with ELMo is also significantly larger then the 1.8% improvement from adding CoVe to a baseline model (McCann et al., 2017 Textual entailment Textual entailment is the task of determining whether a \"hypothesis\" is true, given a \"premise\". The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus (Bowman et al., 2015) provides approximately 550K hypothesis/premise pairs. Our baseline, the ESIM sequence model from Chen et al. (2017), uses a biL-STM to encode the premise and hypothesis, followed by a matrix attention layer, a local inference layer, another biLSTM inference composition layer, and finally a pooling operation before the output layer. Overall, adding ELMo to the ESIM model improves accuracy by an average of 0.7% across five random seeds. A five member ensemble pushes the overall accuracy to 89.3%, exceeding the previous ensemble best of 88.9% (Gong et al., 2018).\nSemantic role labeling A semantic role labeling (SRL) system models the predicate-argument structure of a sentence, and is often described as answering \"Who did what to whom\".  modeled SRL as a BIO tagging problem and used an 8-layer deep biLSTM with forward and backward directions interleaved, following Zhou and Xu (2015).

Our baseline model is the end-to-end span-based neural model of . It uses a biLSTM and attention mechanism to first compute span representations and then applies a softmax mention ranking model to find coreference chains. In our experiments with the OntoNotes coreference annotations from the CoNLL 2012 shared task (Pradhan et al., 2012), adding ELMo improved the average F 1 by 3.2% from 67.2 to 70.4, establishing a new state of the art, again improving over the previous best ensemble result by 1.6% F 1 .\nNamed entity extraction The CoNLL 2003 NER task (Sang and Meulder, 2003) consists of newswire from the Reuters RCV1 corpus tagged with four different entity types (PER, LOC, ORG, MISC). Following recent state-of-the-art systems (Lample et al., 2016;Peters et al., 2017), the baseline model uses pre-trained word embeddings, a character-based CNN representation, two biLSTM layers and a conditional random field (CRF) loss (Lafferty et al., 2001), similar to Collobert et al. (2011). As shown in Table 1, our ELMo enhanced biLSTM-CRF achieves 92.22% F 1 averaged over five runs. The key difference between our system and the previous state of the art from Peters et al. ( 2017) is that we allowed the task model to learn a weighted average of all biLM layers, whereas Peters et al. (2017) only use the top biLM layer.

Previous work on contextual representations used only the last layer, whether it be from a biLM (Peters et al., 2017) or an MT encoder (CoVe;McCann et al., 2017). The choice of the regularization parameter is also important, as large values such as = 1 effectively reduce the weighting function to a simple average over the layers, while smaller values (e.g., = 0.001) allow the layer weights to vary. Table 2 compares these alternatives for SQuAD, SNLI and SRL. Including representations from all layers improves overall performance over just using the last layer, and including contextual representations from the last layer improves performance over the baseline.

Averaging all biLM layers instead of using just the last layer improves F 1 another 0.3% (comparing \"Last Only\" to =1 columns), and allowing the task model to learn individual layer weights improves F 1 another 0.2% ( =1 vs. =0.001).

Using this approach, it is also possible to compare to CoVe, and across each of the individual layers.\nWord sense disambiguation Given a sentence, we can use the biLM representations to predict the sense of a target word using a simple 1nearest neighbor approach, similar to Melamud et al. (2016). To do so, we first use the biLM to compute representations for all words in Sem-Cor 3.0, our training corpus (Miller et al., 1994), and then take the average representation for each sense. At test time, we again use the biLM to compute representations for a given target word and take the nearest neighbor sense from the training set, falling back to the first sense from WordNet for lemmas not observed during training.\nTable 5 compares WSD results using the evaluation framework from Raganato et al. (2017b) across the same suite of four test sets in Raganato et al. (2017a). Overall, the biLM top layer rep-resentations have F 1 of 69.0 and are better at WSD then the first layer. This is competitive with a state-of-the-art WSD-specific supervised model using hand crafted features (Iacobacci et al., 2016) and a task specific biLSTM that is also trained with auxiliary coarse-grained semantic labels and POS tags (Raganato et al., 2017a). The CoVe biLSTM layers follow a similar pattern to those from the biLM (higher overall performance at the second layer compared to the first); however, our biLM outperforms the CoVe biLSTM, which trails the WordNet first sense baseline.\nPOS tagging To examine whether the biLM captures basic syntax, we used the context representations as input to a linear classifier that predicts POS tags with the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993). As the linear classifier adds only a small amount of model capacity, this is direct test of the biLM's representations. Similar to WSD, the biLM representations are competitive with carefully tuned, task specific biLSTMs (Ling et al., 2015;Ma and Hovy, 2016). However, unlike WSD, accuracies using the first biLM layer are higher than the top layer, consistent with results from deep biL-STMs in multi-task training (S\u00f8gaard and Goldberg, 2016;Hashimoto et al., 2017) and MT (Belinkov et al., 2017). CoVe POS tagging accuracies follow the same pattern as those from the biLM, and just like for WSD, the biLM achieves higher accuracies than the CoVe encoder.\nImplications for supervised tasks Taken together, these experiments confirm different layers in the biLM represent different types of information and explain why including all biLM layers is important for the highest performance in downstream tasks.
