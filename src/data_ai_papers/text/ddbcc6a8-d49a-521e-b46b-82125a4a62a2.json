We describe a completely automated and robust technique that detects diseased hearts based on detection and automatic tracking of the endocardium and epicardium of the LV. The local wall regions and the entire heart are then classified as normal or abnormal based on the regional and global LV wall motion. In order to leverage structural information about the heart we applied Bayesian Networks to this problem, and learned the relations among the wall regions off of the data using a structure learning algorithm. We checked the validity of the obtained structure using anatomical knowledge of the heart and medical rules as described by doctors. The resultant Bayesian Network classifier depends only on a small subset of numerical features extracted from dual-contours tracked through time and selected using a filterbased approach.

CHD (along with Congestive Heart Failure) can be detected by measuring and scoring the regional and global motion of the left ventricle (LV) of the heart; CHD typically results in wall-motion abnormalities, i.e., local segments of the LV wall move abnormally (move weakly -known as hypokinesia, not at allknown as akinesia, or out of sync with the rest of the heartknown as dyskinesia), and sometimes motion in multiple regions, or the entire heart, is compromised. The LV can be imaged in a number of ways. The most common method is the echocardiogram -an ultrasound video of different 2-D crosssections of the LV. Echocardiograms are unfortunately notoriously difficult to interpret, and even the best of physicians can misdiagnose heart disease. Hence there is a tremendous need for an automated \"second-reader\" system that can provide objective diagnostic assistance, particularly to the lessexperienced cardiologist.\nIn this paper, we address the task of building a computeraided diagnosis system that can automatically detect wallmotion abnormalities from echocardiograms. Our goal is to develop a real-time system to assist physicians to interpret wall motion scores, and thereby reduce variability and improve diagnostic accuracy of wall motion analysis. Section 2 provides some medical background on cardiac ultrasound and the standard methodology used by cardiologists to score wall-motion abnormalities. In Section 3 we describe our real-life dataset, which consists of echocardiograms from leading healthcare institutions to diagnose wallmotion abnormalities. Sections 4 and 5 provide an overview of our proposed system which we built on top of an algorithm that detects and tracks the inner and outer cardiac walls [Georgescu et al., 2005;Comaniciu, 2003;Comaniciu et al., 2004]. It consists of a classifier that classifies the local region of the heart wall (and the entire heart) as normal or abnormal based on the wall motion. We describe our methodology for feature selection and classification, followed in Section 6 by our experimental results. We reference some related work in Section 7, and conclude with some thoughts about our plans for future research in Section 8.", "publication_ref": ["b1", "b1", "b1"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Medical Background Knowledge", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "What is Coronary Artery Disease?", "text": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) results from the development of plaque within one or several of the arteries that feed the muscle surrounding the left ventricle of the heart. Early signs of CAD include perfusion abnormalities which would indicate the lack of oxygenated blood going to tissue. As CAD progresses, it will manifest itself as wall motion abnormalities, which can be detected by echocardiography. Finally, CAD will lead to angina, or chest pain. This changing manifestation of CAD is described by Picano et al. [Picano et al., 2001;Picano, 1997] as the \"ischemic cascade\". Accurate regional wall motion analysis of the LV is an essential component of interpreting echos to detect this effect, particularly for early disease.\nHeart disease has no gender, geographic or socio-economic boundaries. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a global epi-demic that is the leading cause of death worldwide (17 mil. deaths per year) [World Health Organization, 2004]. Since 1900, CVD has been the No. 1 killer in the USA every year except 1918. It claims more lives each year than the next 4 leading causes of death combined, which are cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, accidents, and diabetes mellitus [American Heart Association, 2006]. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) accounts for more than half the CVD deaths (roughly 7.2 mil. deaths worldwide every year, and 1 of every 5 deaths in the US), and is the single largest killer in the world.

This is the standardization used in this project.\nEcho images are collected from four standard views: apical 4 chamber (A4C, Figure 1 The left ventricle (LV) is divided into 17 myocardial segments, 16 of which are measurable.

All the cases have been labeled at the segment level by a group of trained cardiologists; this is what we refer to as \"ground truth\". Each of the 16 segments were labeled 1 -5 (1 = normal, 2 = hypokinetic, 3 = akinetic, 4 = dyskinetic, 5 = aneurysm), for simplification purposes we converted this 5-class problem to a binary class problem (1 = normal, 2 -5 = abnormal).", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Preparation of the Data", "text": "Our application consists of two main parts: image processing, and classification. In this paper we will focus only on the classification portion, details of the image processing part can be found in the referenced papers. The echos are run through an algorithm which detects and automatically tracks both the interior (endocardial) and exterior (epicardial) borders of the LV [Comaniciu, 2003;Comaniciu et al., 2004]. Motion interferences (e.g. probe motion, patient movement, respiration, etc.) are compensated for by using global motion estimation based on robust statistics outside the LV, this is done so that only the heart's motion is analyzed. Then numerical feature vectors, which are extracted from the dual-contours tracked through time, form the basis for the regional wall motion classification.", "publication_ref": ["b1", "b1"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Image processing", "text": "The first step toward classification of the heart involves contour generation of the LV [Georgescu et al., 2005]. Ultrasound is known to be noisier than other common medical imaging modalities such as MRI or CT, and echocardiograms are even worse due to the fast motion of the heart muscle and respiratory interferences. The framework used by our algorithm is ideal for tracking echo sequences since it exploits heteroscedastic (i.e. location-dependent and anisotropic) measurement uncertainties.\nThe algorithm takes a hand-initialized border and tracks it from one frame to the next through the entire video clip. The inner and outer contours are treated as a single shape for coupled double-contour tracking. \"Intuitively, a double-contour approach can propagate information from the endocardium to guide the localization of the epicardium (or vice versa), thus achieving more robust tracking of the two borders than tracking them independently\" (details in ). The global motion estimation can be seen in Figure 3 as a vertical line near the center of the image. After tracking, numerical features are computed from the dual-contours tracked through time. The features extracted are both global (involving the whole LV) and local (involving individual segments visible in the image), and are based on velocity, thickening, timing, volume changes, etc.", "publication_ref": ["b1"], "figure_ref": ["fig_2"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Extracted Features", "text": "A number of features have been developed to characterize cardiac motion in order to detect cardiac wall motion abnormalities, among them: velocity, radial and circumferential strain, local and global Simpson volume, global and local ejection fraction (EF) ratio, and segmental volume. Some of these features, including velocity, circumferential strain, and local EF ratio, are based on the inner (endocardial) contour.\nDue to the patient examination protocol, only the systole (i.e. contraction phase of the heart) is recorded for some patients. In order for the features to be consistent, the systole is extracted from each patient based on the cavity area change. For each frame, the LV cavity area can be estimated accurately based on the inner (endocardial) contour of that frame. The frame corresponding to the maximal cavity area that is achieved at the end of diastolic phase (expansion phase of the heart) is the frame considered to be the beginning of systole. The frame corresponding to the minimal cavity area (achieved at the end of systolic phase) is the frame assumed to be the end of systole. For the time being, all features are computed based only on the systolic phase. However, the methods used to calculate the features are generally applicable for the diastolic phase as well. The following is a basic description of some of the features:\n\u2022 Velocity features: determines how fast any pair of control points change in the x and y coordinate system per frame. \u2022 Circumferential strain features: also called Fractional Shortening, measures how much the contour between any two control points shrinks in the systolic phase. This is measured along the parameter of the contour. \u2022 Radial strain features: also called Thickening, measures how much the contour shrinks for each control point between any two time frames. This is measured along the radius from a calculated \"center\" of the LV. \u2022 Local and Global Simpson Volume features: determine the volume as computed by the Simpson rule (with 50 disks) for each frame, and for the systolic phase of the heart as a whole (this gives the global EF, which captures the whole heart's contraction abnormalities).\n\u2022 Segmental Volume features: determine the volume per segment per frame, and the segmental EF values (i.e local EFs, which aim to capture the local cardiac contraction abnormalities). In general, the global version of certain features (e.g. radial strain, circumferential strain, etc) can be calculated by taking the mean, or standard deviation, of the 6 segment's respective feature values from any one view. All in all we had 120 local and global features for each of the 3 views (360 total), all of which were continuous. The limitations of present wall motion analysis programs, e.g. color kinesis and blood pool, is that they only evaluate wall motion and not heart wall thickening, which is the hallmark of ischemia. Our program takes both into account.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Segment Classification", "text": "Our data mining process which starts with the raw data (ultrasound videos) and ends with a robust classifier that predicts/ assesses heart wall motion for the 16 segments of the heart, can be summarized as follows:\n1. The image sequences are pre-processed to extract the area of interest (i.e. the LV). Intensity Normalization and an appropriate resizing are applied. 2. Given the initial contour, the border tracking is performed as described in section 4.1, item 2. 3. A set of features is extracted from the tracked contours as described in section 4.2. 4. Using the provided Ground Truth (assessments from the doctors), a network structure is learned that represents the correlations among segments, this process is explained in detail in section 5.2. 5. For each segment, a subset of relevant features for classification is selected (section 5.1), as a result the classifiers we obtain only depend on a small number of numerical features extracted from the dual-contours tracked through time. Having classifiers depending on a small number of features not only improves performance time but also results in better generalization. 6. This subset of numerical features is provided as evidence for the networks' variables of interest (the 16 heart segments) to provide classification for each segment and the whole heart.

It is a well-known fact that a reduction on classifier feature dependence can improve the classifier's generalization capability. However, the problem of selecting an \"optimal\" minimum subset of features from a large pool (in the order of hundreds) of potential original features is known to be NP-hard. In this paper we use a very simple but efficient filter-based approach. In general, Filterbased methods aim to select features based on simple auxiliary criteria, such as feature correlation, to remove redundant features. We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS-test)\nFigure 4: Diagram of process, from raw data to final classifier. [Biesiada J., 2005;Chakravarti and Roy, 1967] to measure the maximum difference between the empirical cumulative distributions of the two classes according to a given feature, in other words, the KS-test measures the difference between the two histograms of the two classes with respect to all the available features. This test is a nonparametric method and it makes no assumptions about the underlying distributions of the two classes being tested .All the available features are ranked by the score given by the KS-test and only the features at the top of the list are selected for classification. Note that a high rank according to the KS-test implies that the corresponding empirical cumulative distributions of the two classes according to these features are considerably different, making these features desirable for discrimination between the two classes.", "publication_ref": ["b0", "b1"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Bayesian Networks", "text": "Bayesian Networks or Belief Networks (BNs) are directed graphical models (e.g., see [Cowell et al., 1999] for an overview): the BN structure is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and the BN parameters are conditional probabilities, represented by a contingency table in case of discrete variables. The directed edges in the graph can often be interpreted in an intuitive way, namely as causal relationships (requiring additional assumptions) [P. Spirtes and Scheines, 2000]. We applied BNs to automatically detecting heart abnormalities to utilize the structural knowledge of the heart segments in hopes of improving the classification accuracy for the whole heart.

Neighboring segments influence each others behavior. And if two segments are fed by the same coronary artery, one is abnormal and the other unknown, then it is better to err on the side of caution and classify the unknown segment as abnormal.\nLearning Bayesian Network structure from data To find a network structure that represents the relations among the heart segments from the data, we used Kevin Murphy's BNT algorithm [Murphy, 2001]. We applied a structure discovery method because creating a structure by hand using only physical knowledge of the heart would have resulted in a cyclic graph. For learning the structure we used the GT from both the training cases and the 2216 non-image cases. It is important to note that the structures that we found using the data, actually mirrored the physical relationships within the heart but without creating cycles, furthermore, the resulting structure coincides with our cardiac knowledge extracted from literature. The obtained structure can be seen in Figure 5. Overlaying the structural relationships learned on the circular diagram of the heart segments (see Figure 6) shows the logical sense of them with respect to the physical heart.", "publication_ref": ["b3"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Testing Learned BN Models", "text": "To test the BNs we learned, we transferred the final networks to a well-known Bayesian networks commercial software, Netica [Norsys: Software corp., 2000] and did parameter training using 220 training cases with images, and 2216 cases without images (i.e. a subset of the same cases used Figure 6: Structural relationships learned by BNT using multi-class labels overlayed on physical heart diagram to do structure learning; note that the 2216 cases without images were only used during training since they incorporated the relationship between segments in their GT). The test set was 125 cases, with images, held out specifically for this purpose. The testing process involved entering all available evidence into the compiled network, running inference, and querying all variables of interest simultaneously. In our case, the evidence given to the network were the 6 best segment specific features found by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (all continuous attributes), and the variables of interest that were queried were the nodes that represented each heart segment (S1, S2, ... , S16; all discrete attributes). After the structure between the segments was learned off of data via the BNT method described above, we manually added the evidence variables using a naive Bayesian methodology (each node representing a segment specific feature was influenced only by the corresponding segment's node in the network, e.g. S2 \u2192 s2 A3C segvol ef).\nAs an alternative to this naive Bayes method, we also tried to learn a general Bayes net (i.e., without any constraints on the network structure), allowing a feature node to be possibly connected to several segment nodes. However, when learning the structure between the imaging-feature nodes and the segment nodes, the number of available training cases with images, namely 220, was very small compared to the number of 96 feature nodes in the Bayes net. This let to large uncertainty concerning the learned structure, and possibly to overfitting. Not surprisingly, we found that, on the test set, the general Bayes net learned from this small amount of training data actually gave results inferior to the ones of the naive Bayes method All continuous valued features were discretized using Recursive Minimal Entropy Partitioning [Dougherty et al., 1995], a method based on minimal entropy heuristic, presented in [Catlett, 1991;Fayyad and Irani, 1993].

It's result can be seen in the ROC curves of four segments in Figure 7. Our feature selection resulted in each segment being dependent on six features (both global and local).
