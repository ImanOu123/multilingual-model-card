While prior work has focused on training speech synthesis models from EMG collected during vocalized speech, we are the first to train from EMG collected during silently articulated speech. We introduce a method of training on silent EMG by transferring audio targets from vocalized to silent signals. Our method greatly improves intelligibility of audio generated from silent EMG compared to a baseline that only trains with vocalized data, decreasing transcription word error rate from 64% to 4% in one data condition and 88% to 68% in another. To spur further development on this task, we share our new dataset of silent and vocalized facial EMG measurements.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "In this paper, we are interested in in enabling speech-like communication without requiring sound to be produced. By using muscular sensor measurements of speech articulator movement, we aim to capture silent speech -utterances that have been articulated without producing sound. In particular, we focus on the task which we call digital voicing, or generating synthetic speech to be transmitted or played back.\nDigitally voicing silent speech has a wide array of potential applications. For example, it could be used to create a device analogous to a Bluetooth headset that allows people to carry on phone conversations without disrupting those around them. Such a device could also be useful in settings where the environment is too loud to capture audible speech or where maintaining silence is important. Alternatively, the technology could be used by some people who are no longer able to produce audible speech, such as individuals whose larynx has been removed due to trauma or disease (Meltzner et al., 2017). In addition to these direct uses of digital voicing for silent speech, it may also be useful as a component technology for creating silent speechto-text systems (Schultz and Wand, 2010), making silent speech accessible to our devices and digital assistants by leveraging existing high-quality audio-based speech-to-text systems.\nTo capture information about articulator movement, we make use of surface electromyography (EMG). Surface EMG uses electrodes placed on top of the skin to measure electrical potentials caused by nearby muscle activity. By placing electrodes around the face and neck, we are able to capture signals from muscles in the speech articulators. Figure 1 shows the EMG electrodes used to capture signals, and Figure 2 shows an example of EMG signals captured. We collect EMG measurements during both vocalized speech (normal speech production that has voicing, frication, and other speech A V -audio from vocalized speech E V -EMG from vocalized speech E S -EMG from silent speech Figure 2: The three components of our data that we will use in our model. The vocalized speech signals A V and E V are collected simultaneously and so are time-aligned, while the silent signal E S is a separate recording of the same utterance without vocalization. During training we use all three signals, and during testing we are given just E S , from which we must generate audio. Colors represent different electrodes in the EMG data. Note that the silent EMG signal E S is qualitatively different from its vocalized counterpart E V . Not pictured, but also included in our data are the utterance texts, in this case: \"It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same.\" (from H.G. Well's The War of the Worlds).\nsounds) and silent speech (speech-like articulations which do not produce sound). We denote these EMG signals E V and E S , respectively. During the vocalized speech we can also record audio A V , but during silent speech there is no meaningful audio to record.\nA substantial body of prior work has explored the use of facial EMG for silent speech-to-text interfaces (Jou et al., 2006;Schultz and Wand, 2010;Kapur et al., 2018;Meltzner et al., 2018). Several initial attempts have also been made to convert EMG signals to speech, similar to the task we approach in this paper (Toth et al., 2009;Janke and Diener, 2017;Diener et al., 2018). However, these works have focused on the artificial task of recovering audio from EMG that was recorded during vocalized speech, rather than the end-goal task of generating from silent speech. In terms of signals in Figure 2, prior work learned a model for producing audio A V from vocalized EMG E V and tested primarily on other vocalized EMG signals.\nWhile one might hope that a model trained in this way could directly transfer to silent EMG E S , Toth et al. (2009) show that such a transfer causes a substantial degradation in quality, which we confirm in Section 4. This direct transfer from vocalized models fails to account for differences between features of the two speaking modes, such as a lack of voicing in the vocal folds and other changes in articulation to suppress sound.\nIn this paper, we extend digital voicing to train on silent EMG E S rather than only vocalized EMG E V . Training with silent EMG is more challenging than with vocalized EMG, because when training on vocalized EMG data we have both EMG inputs and time-aligned speech targets, but for silent EMG any recorded audio will be silent. Our solution is to adopt a target-transfer approach, where audio output targets are transferred from vocalized recordings to silent recordings of the same utterances. We align the EMG features of the instance pairs with dynamic time warping (Rabiner and Juang, 1993), then make refinements to the alignments using canonical correlation analysis (Hotelling, 1936) and audio feature outputs from a partially trained model. The alignments can then be used to associate speech outputs with the silent EMG signals E S , and these speech outputs are used as targets for training a recurrent neural transduction model. We validate our method using both human and automatic metrics, and find that a model trained with our target transfer approach greatly outperforms a model trained on vocalized EMG alone. On a closed-vocabulary domain (date and time expressions \u00a72.1), transcription word error rate (WER) from a human evaluation improves from 64% to just 4%. On a more challenging open vocabulary domain (reading from books \u00a72.2) intelligibility measurements improve by 20% -from 88% to 68% with automatic transcription or 95% to 75% with human transcription.\nWe release our dataset of EMG signals collected during both silent and vocalized speech. The dataset contains nearly 20 hours of facial EMG signals from a single speaker. To our knowledge, the largest public EMG-speech dataset previously available contains just 2 hours of data (Wand et al., 2014), and many papers continue to use private datasets. We hope that this public release will encourage development on the task and allow for fair comparisons between methods.", "publication_ref": ["b8", "b12", "b5", "b12", "b6", "b9", "b13", "b4", "b1", "b13", "b11", "b3", "b14"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Data Collection", "text": "We collect a dataset of EMG signals and timealigned audio from a single speaker during both silent and vocalized speech.

When training solely on vocal-2 https://pypi.org/project/noisereduce/ ized EMG data (E V to A V ), training this model is straightforward. However, our experiments show that training on vocalized EMG alone leads to poor performance when testing on silent EMG (Section 4) because of differences between the two speaking modes.\nA core contribution of our work is a method of training the transducer model on silent EMG signals, which no longer have time-aligned audio to use as training targets. We briefly describe our method here, then refer to section Section 3.2 for more details. Using a set of utterances recorded in both silent and vocalized speaking modes, we find alignments between the two recordings and use them to associate speech features from the vocalized instance (A V ) with the silent EMG E S . The alignment is initially found using dynamic time warping between EMG signals and then is refined using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and predicted audio from a partially trained model.\nFinally, to generate audio from predicted speech features, we use a WaveNet decoder, as described in Section 3.3.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "EMG to Speech Feature Transducer", "text": "When converting EMG input signals to audio outputs, our first step is to use a bidirectional LSTM to convert between featurized versions of the signals, E and A . Both feature representations operate at the same frequency, 100 Hz, so that each EMG input E [i] corresponds to a single time-aligned output A [i]. Our primary features for representing EMG signals are the time domain features from Jou et al. (2006), which are commonly used in the EMG-speech-to-text literature. After splitting the signal from each channel into low and highfrequency components (x low and x high ) using a triangular filter with cutoff 134 Hz, the signal is windowed with a frame length of 27 ms and shift of 10 ms. For each frame, five features are computed as follows:\n1 n i (x low [i]) 2 , 1 n i x low [i], 1 n i (x high [i]) 2 , 1 n i |x high [i]|, ZCR(x high )\nwhere ZCR is the zero-crossing rate. In addition to the time domain features, we also append magnitude values from a 16-point Short-time Fourier transform for each 27 ms frame, which gives us 9 additional features. The two representations result in a total of 112 features to represent the 8 EMG channels. Speech is represented with 26 Melfrequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from 27 ms frames with 10 ms stride. All EMG and audio features are normalized to approximately zero mean and unit variance before processing. To help the model to deal with minor differences in electrode placement across sessions, we represent each session with a 32 dimensional session embedding and append the session embedding to the EMG features across all timesteps of an example before feeding into the LSTM.\nThe LSTM model itself consists of 3 bidirectional LSTM layers with 1024 hidden units, followed by a linear projection to the speech feature dimension. Dropout 0.5 is used between all layers, as well as before the first LSTM and after the last LSTM. The model is trained with a mean squared error loss against time-aligned speech features using the Adam optimizer. The initial learning rate is set to .001, and is decayed by half after every 5 epochs with no improvement in validation loss. We evaluate a loss on the validation set at the end of every epoch, and select the parameters from the epoch with the best validation loss as the final model.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Audio Target Transfer", "text": "To train the EMG to speech feature transducer, we need speech features that are time-aligned with the EMG features to use as target outputs. However, when training with EMG from silent speech, simultaneously-collected audio recordings do not have any audible speech to use as targets. In this section, we describe how parallel utterances, as described in Section 2, can be used to transfer audio feature labels from a vocalized recording to a silent one. More concretely, given a tuple (E S , E V , A V ) of features from silent speech EMG, vocalized speech EMG, and vocalized speech audio, where E V and A V are collected simultaneously, we estimate a set of audio features\u00c3 S that time-align with E S and represent the output that we would like our transduction network to predict. A diagram of the method can be found in Figure 3.\nOur alignment will make use of dynamic time warping (DTW) (Rabiner and Juang, 1993), a dynamic programming algorithm for finding a minimum-cost monotonic alignment between two sequences s 1 and s 2 . DTW builds a table d[i, j] of the minimum cost of alignment between the first i items in s 1 and the first j items in s 2 . The recursive step used to fill this table is \nd[i, j] = \u03b4[i, j] + min (d[i \u2212 1, j], d[i, j \u2212 1], d[i \u2212 1, j \u2212 1]), where \u03b4[i, j] is the local cost of aligning s 1 [i] with s 2 [j].\nAfter the dynamic program, we can follow backpointers through the table to find a path of (i, j) pairs representing an alignment. Although the path is monotonic, a single position i may repeat several times with increasing values of j. We take the first pair from any such sequence to form a mapping a s 1 s 2 [i] \u2192 j from every position i in s 1 to a position j in s 2 .\nFor our audio target transfer, we perform DTW as described above with s 1 = E S and s 2 = E V . Initially, we use euclidean distance between the features of E S and E V for the alignment cost\n(\u03b4 EMG [i, j] = E S [i] \u2212 E V [j]\n), but will describe several refinements to this choice in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 below. DTW results in an alignment a SV [i] \u2192 j that tells us a position j in E V for every position i in E S . We can then create a warped audio feature sequence\u00c3 S that aligns with E S us-ing\u00c3\nS [i] = A V [a SV [i]].\nDuring training of the EMG to audio transduction model, we will use\u00c3 S as our targets for the transduction outputs\u00c2 S when calculating a loss.\nThis procedure of aligning signals to translate between them is reminiscent of some DTW-based methods for the related task of voice conversion (Kobayashi and Toda, 2018;Desai et al., 2009). The difference between these tasks is that our task operates on triples (E S , E V , A V ) and must account for the difference in modality between the input E S and output A V , while voice conversion operates in a single modality with examples of the form (A 1 , A 2 ).\nIn addition to training the transducer from E S to\u00c3 S , we also find that training on the vocalized signals (E V to A V ) improves performance. The vocalized samples are labeled with different session embeddings to allow the model to specialize to each speaking mode. Each training batch contains samples from both modes mixed together. For the open vocabulary setting, the full set of examples to sample from has 3 sources: (E S ,\u00c3 S ) created from parallel utterances, (E V , A V ) from the vocalized recording of the parallel utterances, and (E V , A V ) from the non-parallel vocalized recordings.", "publication_ref": ["b11", "b7", "b0"], "figure_ref": ["fig_1"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "CCA", "text": "While directly aligning EMG features E S and E V can give us a rough alignment between the signals, doing so ignores the differences between the two signals that lead us to want to train on the silent signals in the first place (e.g. inactivation of the vocal folds and changes in manner of articulation to prevent frication). To better capture correspondences between the signals, we use canonical correlation analysis (CCA) (Hotelling, 1936) to find components of the two signals which are more highly correlated. Given a number of paired vectors (v 1 , v 2 ), CCA finds linear projections P 1 and P 2 that maximize correlation between corresponding dimensions of P 1 v 1 and P 2 v 2 .\nTo get the initial pairings required by CCA, we use alignments found by DTW with the raw EMG feature distance \u03b4 EMG . We aggregate aligned E S and E V features over the entire dataset and feed these to a CCA algorithm to get projections P S and P V . CCA allows us to choose the dimensionality of the space we are projecting to, and we use 15 dimensions for all experiments. Using the projections from CCA, we define a new cost for DTW\n\u03b4 CCA [i, j] = P S E S [i] \u2212 P V E V [j]\nOur use of CCA for DTW is similar to Zhou and Torre (2009), which combined the two methods for use in aligning human pose data, but we found their iterative approach did not improve performance compared to a single application of CCA in our setting.", "publication_ref": ["b3", "b15"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Refinement with Predicted Audio", "text": "So far, our alignments between the silent and vocalized recordings have relied solely on distances between EMG features.
