In this paper we present the first probabilistic treatment of a basic question in phonological typology: What makes a natural vowel inventory?

However, some structures seem to occur or co-occur more frequently than others. Linguistic typology attempts to describe the range of natural variation and seeks to organize and quantify linguistic universals, such as patterns of co-occurrence. Perhaps one of the simplest typological questions comes from phonology: which vowels tend to occur and co-occur within the phoneme inventories of different languages? Drawing inspiration from the linguistic literature, we propose models of the probability distribution from which the attested vowel inventories have been drawn.\nIt is a typological universal that every language contains both vowels and consonants (Velupillai, 2012). But which vowels a language contains is guided by softer constraints, in that certain configurations are more widely attested than others. For instance, in a typical phoneme inventory, there tend to be far fewer vowels than consonants. Likewise, all languages contrast vowels based on height, although which contrast is made is language-dependent (Ladefoged and Maddieson, 1996). Moreover, while over 600 unique vowel Figure 1: The transformed vowel space that is constructed within one of our deep generative models (see \u00a77.1). A deep network nonlinearly maps the blue grid (\"formant space\") to the red grid (\"metric space\"), with individual vowels mapped from blue to red position as shown. Vowel pairs such as [@]- [O] that are brought close together are anti-correlated in the point process. Other pairs such as [y]-[1] are driven apart. For purposes of the visualization, we have transformed the red coordinate system to place red vowels near their blue positions-while preserving distances up to a constant factor (a \"Procrustes transformation\").\nphonemes have been attested cross-linguistically (Moran et al., 2014), certain regions of acoustic space are used much more often than others, e.g., the regions conventionally transcribed as [a], [i], and [u]. Human language also seems to prefer inventories where phonologically distinct vowels are spread out in acoustic space (\"dispersion\") so that they can be easily distinguished by a listener. We depict the acoustic space for English in Figure 2.\nIn this work, we regard the proper goal of linguistic typology as the construction of a universal prior distribution from which linguistic systems are drawn. For vowel system typology, we propose three formal probability models based on stochastic point processes. We estimate the parameters of the model on one set of languages and evaluate performance on a held-out set. We explore three questions: (i) How well do the properties of our proposed probability models line up experimentally with linguistic theory? (ii) How well can our models predict held-out vowel systems? (iii) Do our models benefit from a \"deep\" transformation from formant space to metric space?

Since a BPP predicts each vowel independently, it only models focalization. Thus, the model provides an appropriate baseline that will let us measure the importance of the dispersion principle-how far can we get with just focalization? A BPP may still tend to generate well-dispersed sets if it defines \u03c6 to be large only on certain vowels in V and these are well-dispersed (e.g., [i], [u], [a]).

Under this view, drawing some subset of V from the point process is regarded as drawing some indicator function on V. 3 We point out that such a scheme would break down if we extended our work to cover fine-grained phonetic modeling of the vowel inventory. In that setting, we ask not just whether the inventory includes /i/ but exactly which pronunciation of /i/ it contains. In the limit, \u03c6 becomes a function over a continuous vowel space V = R 2 , turning the BPP into an inhomogeneous spatial Poisson process. A continuous \u03c6 function implies that the model places similar probability on similar vowels. Then if most vowel inventories contain some version of /i/, then many of them will contain several closely related variants of /i/ (independently chosen).

Roughly speaking, the potential \u03c8(v i , v j ) should be large if the i th and j th vowel often co-occur. Recall that under the principle of dispersion, the vowels that often co-occur are easily distinguishable. Thus, confusable vowel pairs should tend to have potential \u03c8(v i , v j ) < 1.\nUnlike the BPP, the MPP can capture both focalization and dispersion. In this work, we will consider a fully connected MPP, i.e., there is a potential function for each pair of vowels in V.

More precisely, \u03c6(v i ), \u03c6(v j ) are the lengths of vectors e i , e j while \u03b8 is the angle between them.

No standard procedure was followed across all languages: it was up to individual phoneticists to determine the size of each vowel inventory, the choice of IPA symbols to describe it, and the procedure for measuring the formants. Moreover, it is an idealization to provide a single vector of formants for each vowel type in the language. In real speech, different tokens of the same vowel are pronounced differently, because of coarticulation with the vowel context, allophony, interspeaker variation, and stochastic intraspeaker variation. Even within a token, the formants change during the duration of the vowel. Thus, one might do better to represent a vowel's pronunciation not by a formant vector, but by a conditional probability distribution over its formant trajectories given its context, or by a parameter vector that characterizes such a conditional distribution.

We now describe three possible methods for mapping f (v i ) to an embedding e(v i ). Each of these maps has learnable parameters.\nNeural Embedding. We first consider directly embedding each vowel v i into a vector space R r . We achieve this through a feed-forward neural net 7) gives an architecture with 1 layer of nonlinearity; in general we consider stacking d \u2265 0 layers.

We are interested in the special case of neural embeddings when r = k since then (for any d) the mapping f (v i ) \u2192 e(v i ) is a diffeomorphism: 8 a smooth invertible function of R k . An example of such a diffeomorphism is shown in Figure 1.\nThere is a long history in cognitive psychology of mapping stimuli into some psychological space. The distances in this psychological space may be predictive of generalization (Shepard, 1987) or of perception. Due to the anatomy of the ear, the mapping of vowels from acoustic space to perceptual space is often presumed to be nonlinear (Rosner and Pickering, 1994;Nearey and Kiefte, 2003), and there are many perceptually-oriented phonetic scales, e.g., Bark and Mel, that carry out such nonlinear transformations while preserving the dimensionality k, as we do here. As discussed in \u00a72.2, vowel system typology is similarly believed to be influenced by distances between the vowels in a latent metric space. We are interested in whether a constrained k-dimensional model of these distances can do well in our experiments.\nPrototype-Based Embedding. Unfortunately, our interpretable neural embedding is unfortunately incompatible with the DPP. The DPP assigns probability 0 to any vowel inventory V whose e vectors are linearly dependent. If the vectors are in R k , then this means that p(V ) = 0 whenever |V | > k. In our setting, this would limit vowel inventories to size 2.\nOur solution to this problem is to still construct our interpretable metric space R k , but then map that nonlinearly to R r for some large r. This latter map is constrained. Specifically, we choose \"prototype\" points \u00b5 1 , . . . , \u00b5 r \u2208 R k . These prototype points are parameters of the model: their coordinates are learned and do not necessarily correspond to any actual vowel. We then construct e(v i ) \u2208 R r as a \"response vector\" of similarities of our vowel v i to these prototypes. Crucially, the responses depend on distances measured in the interpretable metric space R k . We use a Gaussian-density response function, where x(v i ) denotes the representation of our vowel v i in the interpretable space:\ne(v i ) = w p(x(v i ); \u00b5 , \u03c3 2 I) (8) = w (2\u03c0\u03c3 2 ) \u2212( k 2 ) exp \u2212||x \u2212 \u00b5 || 2 2\u03c3 2 .\nfor = 1, 2, . . . , r. We additionally impose the constraints that each w \u2265 0 and r =1 w = 1. Notice that the sum r =1 e(v i ) may be viewed as the density at x(v i ) under a Gaussian mixture model. We use this fact to construct a prototypebased MPP as well: we redefine \u03c6(v i ) to equal this positive density, while still defining \u03c8 via equation (6). The idea is that dispersion is measured in the interpretable space R k , and focalization is defined by certain \"good\" regions in that space that are centered at the r prototypes.", "publication_ref": ["b31", "b29", "b25"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Evaluation Metrics", "text": "Fundamentally, we are interested in whether our model has abstracted the core principles of what makes a good vowel system.

In other words, how likely does our model think unobserved, but attested vowel systems are? While this is a natural evaluation paradigm in NLP, it has not-to the best of our knowledge-been applied to a quantitative investigation of linguistic typology.\nAs a second evaluation, we introduce a vowel system cloze task that could also be used to evaluate non-probabilistic models. This task is defined by analogy to the traditional semantic cloze task (Taylor, 1953), where the reader is asked to fill in a missing word in the sentence from the context. In our vowel system cloze task, we present a learner with a subset of the vowels in a held-out vowel system and ask them to predict the remaining vowels.

Second, we predict up to one missing vowel where a vowel may have been deleted. Third, we predict up to two missing vowels, where one or two vowels may be deleted.\n{[i], [u]} given {[I], [U], [E], [ae], [O], [A],", "publication_ref": ["b34"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "We evaluate our models using 10-fold crossvalidation over the 223 languages.

This ranking holds for Table 1: Cross-entropy in nats (lower is better) and cloze prediction accuracy (higher is better). \"BPP\" is a simple BPP with one parameter for each of the 53 vowels in V. This model does artificially well by modeling an \"accidental\" feature of our data: it is able to learn not only which vowels are popular among languages, but also which IPA symbols are popular or conventional among the descriptive phoneticists who created our dataset (see footnote 6), something that would become irrelevant if we upgraded our task to predict actual formant vectors rather than IPA symbols (see footnote 3). Our point processes, by contrast, are appropriately allowed to consider a vowel only through its formant vector. The \"u-\" versions of the models use the uninterpretable neural embedding of the formant vector into R r : by taking r to be large, they are still able to learn special treatment for each vowel in V (which is why uBPP performs identically to BPP, before being beaten by uMPP and uDPP). The \"i-\" versions limit themselves to an interpretable neural embedding into R k , giving a more realistic description that does not perform as well. The \"p-\"versions lift that R k embedding into R r by measuring similarities to r prototypes; they thereby improve on the corresponding i-versions.\nFor each result shown, the depth d of our neural network was tuned on a development set (typically d = 2). r was also tuned when applicable (typically r > 100 dimensions for the u-models and r \u2248 30 prototypes for the p-models).\neach of the 3 embedding schemes. The embedding schemes themselves are compared in the caption. Within each embedding scheme, the BPP performs several points worse on the cloze tasks, confirming that dispersion is needed to model vowel inventories well. Still, the BPP's respectable performance shows that much of the structure can be capture by focalization. As \u00a73 noted, the BPP may generate well-dispersed sets, as the common vowels tend to be dispersed already (see Figure 4). In this capacity, however, the BPP is not explanatory as it cannot actually tell us why these vowels should be frequent.\nWe mention that depth in the neural network is helpful, with deeper embedding networks performing slightly better than depth d = 0.\nFinally, we identified each model's favorite complete vowel system of size n (Table 2). For the BPP, this is simply the n most probable vowels. Decoding the DPP and MPP is NP-hard, but we found the best system by brute force (for small n). The dispersion in these models predicts different systems than the BPP.\n8 Discussion: Probabilistic Typology Typology as Density Estimation? Our goal is to define a universal distribution over all possible vowel inventories. Is this appropriate? We regard this as a natural approach to typology, because it directly describes which kinds of linguistic systems are more or less common. Traditional implicational universals (\"all languages with v i have v j \") are softened, in our approach, into conditional probabilities such as \"p(v j \u2208 V | v i \u2208 V ) \u2248 0.9.\" Here the 0.9 is not merely an empirical ratio, but a smoothed probability derived from the complete estimated distribution. It is meant to make predictions about unseen languages.\nWhether human language learners exploit any properties of this distribution 10 is a separate question that goes beyond typology. Jakobson (1941) did find that children acquired phoneme inventories in an order that reflected principles similar to dispersion (\"maximum contrast\") and focalization.\nAt any rate, we estimate the distribution given some set of attested systems that are assumed to have been drawn IID from it. One might object that this IID assumption ignores evolutionary relationships among the attested systems, causing our estimated distribution to favor systems that are coincidentally frequent among current human languages, rather than being natural in some timeless sense. We reply that our approach is then appropriate when the goal of typology is to estimate the distribution of actual human languages-a distribution that can be utilized in principle (and also in practice, as we show) to predict properties of actual languages from outside the training set.\nA different possible goal of typology is a theory of natural human languages. This goal would require a more complex approach. One should not imagine that natural languages are drawn in a vacuum from some single, stationary distribution. Rather, each language is drawn conditionally on its parent language. Thus, one should estimate a stochastic model of the evolution of linguistic systems through time, and identify \"naturalness\" with BPP MPP DPP changes from n \u2212 1 changes from n \u2212 1 changes from n \u2212 1 n MAP inventory additions deletions MAP inventory additions deletions MAP inventory additions deletions\n1 i i @ @ @ @ 2 i, u u i, u i, u @ i, u i, u @ 3\ni, u, a a i, u, a a i, u, a a 4 i, u, a, o o i, u, a, e e i, u, a, o o 5 i, u, a, o, e e i, u, a, e, @ @ i, u, a, o, @ o Table 2: Highest-probability inventory of each size according to our three models (prototype-based embeddings and d = 3). The MAP configuration is computed by brute-force enumeration for small n.\nthe directions in which this system tends to evolve.\nEnergy Minimization Approaches. The traditional energy-based approach (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972) to vowel simulation minimizes the following objective (written in our notation):\nE(m) = 1\u2264i<j\u2264m 1 ||e(v i ) \u2212 e(v j )|| 2 , (9)\nwhere the vectors e(v i ) \u2208 R r are not spit out of a deep network, as in our case, but rather directly optimized. Liljencrants and Lindblom (1972) propose a coordinate descent algorithm to optimize E(m). While this is not in itself a probabilistic model, they generate diverse vowel systems through random restarts that find different local optima (a kind of deterministic evolutionary mechanism). We note that equation ( 9) assumes that the number of vowels m is given, and only encodes a notion of dispersion. Roark (2001) subsequently extended equation ( 9) to include the notion of focalization.\nVowel Inventory Size. A fatal flaw of the traditional energy minimization paradigm is that it has no clear way to compare vowel inventories of different sizes. The problem is quite crippling since, in general, inventories with fewer vowels will have lower energy. This does not match reality-the empirical distribution over inventory sizes (shown in Figure 5) shows that the mode is actually 5 and small inventories are uncommon: no 1-vowel inventory is attested and only one 2-vowel inventory is known. A probabilistic model over all vowel systems must implicitly model the size of the system. Indeed, our models pit all potential inventories against each other, bestowing the extra burden to match the empirical distribution over size.\nFrequency of Inventories. Another problem is the inability to model frequency. While for inventories of a modest size (3-5 vowels) there are very few unique attested systems, there is a plethora of attested larger vowel systems. The energy minimization paradigm has no principled manner to tell the scientist how likely a novel system may be. Appealing again to the empirical distribution over attested vowel systems, we consider the relative diversity of systems of each size. We graph this in Figure 5. Consider all vowel systems of size 7. There are |V| 7 potential inventories, yet the empirical distribution is remarkably peaked. Our probabilistic models have the advantage in this context as well, as they naturally quantify the likelihood of an individual inventory.\nTypology is a Small-Data Problem. In contrast to many common problems in applied NLP, e.g., part-of-speech tagging, parsing and machine translation, the modeling of linguistic typology is fundamentally a \"small-data\" problem. Out of the 7105 languages on earth, we only have linguistic annotation for 2600 of them (Comrie et al., 2013). Moreover, we only have phonetic and phonological annotation for a much smaller set of languagesbetween 300-500 (Maddieson, 2013). Given the paucity of data, overfitting on only those attested languages is a dangerous possibility-just because a certain inventory has never been attested, it is probably wrong to conclude that it is impossibleor even improbable-on that basis alone. By analogy to language modeling, almost all sentences observed in practice are novel with respect to the training data, but we still must employ a principled manner to discriminate high-probability sentences (which are syntactically and semantically coherent) from low-probability ones. Probabilistic modeling provides a natural paradigm for this sort of investigation-machine learning has developed well-understood smoothing techniques, e.g., regularization with tuning on a held-out dev set, to avoid overfitting in a small-data scenario.\nRelated Work in NLP. Various point processes have been previously applied to potpourri of tasks in NLP. Determinantal point processes have found a home in the literature in tasks that require diversity. E.g., DPPs have achieved state-of-the-art results on multi-document document summarization (Kulesza and Taskar, 2011), news article selection (Affandi et al., 2012) recommender systems (Gartrell et al., 2017), joint clustering of verbal lexical semantic properties (Reichart and Korhonen, 2013), inter alia. Poisson point processes have also been applied to NLP problems: Yee et al. (2015) model the emerging topic on social media using a homogeneous point process and Lukasik et al. (2015) apply a log-Gaussian point process, a variant of the Poisson point process, to rumor detection in Twitter. We are unaware of previous attempts to probabilistically model vowel inventory typology.\nFuture Work. This work lends itself to several technical extensions. One could expand the function f to more completely characterize each vowel's acoustic properties, perceptual properties, or distinctive features (footnote 7). One could generalize our point process models to sample finite subsets from the continuous space of vowels (footnote 3). One could consider augmenting the MPP with a new factor that explicitly controls the size of the vowel inventory. Richer families of point processes might also be worth exploring. For example, perhaps the vowel inventory is generated by some temporal mechanism with latent intermediate steps, such as sequential selection of the vowels or evolutionary drift of the inventory. Another possibility is that vowel systems tend to reuse distinctive features or even follow factorial designs, so that an inventory with creaky front vowels also tends to have creaky back vowels.
