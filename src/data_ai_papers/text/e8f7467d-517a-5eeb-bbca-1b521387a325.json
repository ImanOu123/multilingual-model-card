They are deeply integrated into work practices of machine learning researchers, serving as resources for training and testing machine learning models. Datasets also play a central role in the organization of MLR as a scientific field. Benchmark datasets provide stable points of comparison and coordinate scientists around shared research problems. Improved performance on benchmarks is considered a key signal for collective progress. Such performance is thus an important form of scientific capital, sought after by individual researchers and used to evaluate and rank their contributions.\nDatasets exemplify machine learning tasks, typically through a collection of input and output pairs [1]. When they institutionalize benchmark datasets, task communities implicitly endorse these data as meaningful abstractions of a task or problem domain. The institutionalization of benchmarks influences the behavior of both researchers and end-users [2]. Because advancement on established benchmarks is viewed as an indicator of progress, researchers are encouraged to make design choices that maximize performance on benchmarks, as this increases the legitimacy of their work. Institutionalization signals to industry adopters that models can be expected to perform in the real world as they do on the benchmark datasets. Close alignment of benchmark datasets with \"real world\" tasks is thus critical to accurate measurement of collective scientific progress and to safe, ethical, and effective deployment of models in the wild.\nGiven their central role in the social and scientific organization of MLR, benchmark datasets have also become a central object of critical inquiry in recent years [3]. Dataset audits have revealed concerning biases that have direct implications for algorithmic bias and harms [4,5,6,7]. Problematic categorical schemas have been identified in popular image datasets, including poorly-formulated categories and the inclusion of derogatory and offensive labels [8,9]. Research into the disciplinary norms of dataset development has revealed troubling practices around dataset development and dissemination, like unstandardized documentation and maintenance practices [10,11,12]. There is also growing concern about the limitations of existing datasets and standard metrics for evaluating model behavior in real-world settings and assessing scientific progress in a problem domain [13,14].\nDespite the increase in critical attention to benchmark datasets, surprisingly little attention has been paid to patterns of dataset use and reuse across the field as a whole. In this paper, we dig into these dynamics. We study how dataset usage patterns differ across machine learning subcommunities and across time (from 2015-2020) in the Papers With Code (PWC) corpus. 1 More specifically, we study machine learning subcommunities that have formed around different machine learning tasks (e.g., Sentiment Analysis and Facial Recognition) and examine: (i) the extent to which research within task communities is concentrated or distributed across different benchmark datasets; (ii) patterns of dataset creation and adoption between different task communites; and (iii) the institutional origins of the most dominant datasets.\nWe find increasing concentration on fewer and fewer datasets within most task communities. Consistent with this finding, the majority of papers within most tasks use datasets that were originally created for other tasks, instead of ones explicitly created for their own task-even though most tasks have created more datasets than they have imported. Lastly, we find that these dominant datasets have been introduced by researchers at just a handful of elite institutions.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, we motivate our research questions by underscoring the critical importance of benchmarks in coordinating machine learning research. Second, we describe our analyses on the PWC corpus, a catalog of datasets and their usage jointly curated by the machine learning community (manually) and by Facebook AI Research (algorithmically). We then present our findings and discuss their implications for scientific validity, the ethical usage of MLR, and inequity within the field. We close by offering recommendations for possible reform efforts for the field.\n2 Related Work: Scientific, Social, and Ethical Importance of Datasets Following Schlangen [1], we understand machine learning benchmarks as community resources against which models are evaluated and compared. Benchmarks typically formalize a particular task through a dataset and an associated quantitative metric of evaluation. The practice was originally introduced to MLR after the \"AI Winter\" of the 1980s by government funders, who sought to more accurately assess the value received on grants [15,16]. Today, benchmarking is the dominant paradigm for scientific evaluation in MLR, and the field collectively views upward trends on benchmarks as noisy but meaningful indicators of scientific progress [1,2,17]. Over time, MLR has evolved strong norms to facilitate widespread benchmarking, including the development of open-access datasets, formal competitions and challenges, and accompanying \"black-box\" software that allows researchers to test their algorithms on benchmark datasets with minimal effort.\nThe establishment of benchmark datasets as shared evaluative resources across the MLR community has unique advantages for coordinating scientists around common goals. First, barriers to participation in MLR are reduced, since well-resourced institutions can shoulder the costs of dataset curation and annotation. 2 Second, by reducing otherwise complex comparisons to a single agreed-upon measure, the scientific community can easily align on the value of research contributions and assess whether progress is being made on a particular task [19,20]. Finally, a complete commitment to benchmarking has allowed MLR to relax reliance on slower institutions for evaluating progress like peer-review, qualitative or heuristic evaluation, or theoretical integration. Together, these advantages have contributed to MLR's unprecedented transformation into a \"rapid discovery science\" in the past decade [21].\nWhile there are clear advantages to benchmarking as a methodology for comparing algorithms and measuring progress, there are growing concerns about benchmarking cultures in MLR that tend to valorize state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on established benchmark datasets over other forms of quantitative or qualitative analysis. The necessity of SOTA results on well-established benchmarks for publication has been identified as a barrier to the development of new ideas [22]. There have been growing calls for more rigorous and comprehensive empirical analysis of models beyond standard topline metrics: reporting model size, energy consumption, fairness metrics, and more [23,24,25,26]. The standard benchmarking paradigm also contributes to issues with underspecification in ML pipelines; a given level of performance on a held-out benchmark test set doesn't guarantee that a model has learned the appropriate causal structure of a problem [14]. In short, while community alignment on benchmarks and metrics can enable rapid algorithmic advancement, excessive focus on single metrics at the expense of more comprehensive forms of rigorous evaluation can lead the community astray and risk the development of models that generalize poorly to the real world.\nThe MLR community has begun to reflect on the utility of established benchmarks and their suitability for evaluative purposes. For example, the Fashion-MNIST dataset was introduced because the original MNIST dataset came to be perceived as over-utilized and too easy [27]; the utility of ImageNet -one of the most influential ML benchmarks in existence -as a meaningful measure of progress has been a focus of critical examination in the past few years [28,29]. SOTA-chasing concerns are also compounded by the great capacity ML algorithms have to be \"right for the wrong reason\" [30], enabling SOTA results that rely on \"shortcuts\" rather than learning the causal structure dictated by the task [13]. Bender et al. suggest the NLP community may have been \"led down the garden path\" by over-focusing on \"beating\" benchmark tasks with models that can easily manipulate linguistic form without any real capacity for language understanding [31]. Recent dataset audits have also revealed that established benchmark datasets tend to reflect very narrow -typically white, male, Westernslices of the world [4,5,6,7,9]. Thus, over-concentration of research on a small number of datasets and metrics can distort perceptions of progress within the field and have serious ethical implications for communities impacted by deployed models. Despite these discussions, little empirical work has considered whether over-concentration of research on a small number of datasets is a systemic issue across MLR. This prompts our first research question: RQ1: How concentrated are machine learning task communities on specific datasets, and has this changed over time?\nThere are also growing concerns regarding the gap between benchmark datasets and the problem domains in which they are used to evaluate progress. For example, Scheuerman et al. found that computer vision datasets tend to be developed in a manner that is decontextualized from a particular task or application area [12]. Supposedly \"general purpose\" benchmarks are often valued within the field, though the precise bounds of what makes a dataset suitable for general evaluative purposes remains unclear [17]. These observations prompt our second research question: RQ2: How frequently do machine learning researchers borrow datasets from other tasks instead of using ones created explicitly for that task? Despite widespread recognition that datasets are critical to the advancement of the field, careful dataset development is often undervalued and disincentivized, especially relative to algorithmic contributions [12,32]. Given the high value the MLR community places on SOTA performance on established benchmarks, researchers are also incentivized to reuse recognizable benchmarks to legitimize their contributions. Dataset development is time-and labor-intensive, making large-scale dataset development potentially inaccessible to lower-resourced institutions. These observations prompt our final research question: RQ3: What institutions are responsible for the major ML benchmarks in circulation?\nOur paper makes two distinct contributions to the literature. First, it provides a concise, multidimensional discussion of the pros and cons of benchmarking as an evaluation paradigm in MLR, drawing on earlier work as well as insights from the sociology of science. Second, and more substantially, it provides the first field-level, quantitative analysis of benchmarking practice in MLR.", "publication_ref": ["b0", "b1", "b2", "b3", "b4", "b5", "b6", "b7", "b8", "b9", "b10", "b11", "b12", "b13", "b0", "b0", "b14", "b15", "b0", "b1", "b16", "b1", "b18", "b19", "b20", "b21", "b22", "b23", "b24", "b25", "b13", "b26", "b27", "b28", "b29", "b12", "b30", "b3", "b4", "b5", "b6", "b8", "b11", "b16", "b11", "b31"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Data", "text": "Our primary data source is Papers With Code (PWC), an open source repository for machine learning papers, datasets, and evaluation tables created by researchers at Facebook AI Research. PWC is largely community-contributed -anyone can add a benchmarking result or a task, provided the benchmarking result is publicly available in a pre-print repository, conference proceeding, or journal. Once tasks and datasets are introduced by humans, PWC scrapes arXiv using keyword searches to find other examples of the task or uses of the dataset.\nWe downloaded the complete PWC dataset on 06/16/2021 (licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0). In this study, we focus primarily on the \"Datasets\" archive, as well as papers utilizing those datasets. Each dataset in the archive is associated with metadata such as the modality of the dataset (e.g., texts, images, video, graphs), the date the dataset was introduced, and the paper title that introduced the dataset (if relevant). We found 4,384 datasets on the site and scraped 60,647 papers that PWC associates with those datasets using a PWC internal API (see Figure A2 for a truncated histogram of usage across datasets).\nIn PWC papers, benchmarks and datasets are associated with tasks (e.g., Object Recognition, Machine Translation). Because we are interested in the dynamics of dataset usage (both within and across task communities), our first two analyses are restricted to dataset usages published in papers annotated with tasks. We call the task for which the dataset was originally designed the \"origin task.\" We call the task of the paper using the dataset the \"destination task.\" For example, ImageNet [33] was introduced as a benchmark for Object Recognition and Object Localization (origin tasks), but is now regularly utilized as a benchmark for Image Generation (destination task) among many others.\nPWC includes a taxonomy of tasks and subtasks. The graph is cyclic, making it hard to disentangle dataset transfer between broad tasks and finer-grained tasks. For each dataset transfer, we record the transfer between the origin task and the destination task. We also record the transfer between the origin's parents and the destination's parents. This approach allows us to accurately capture transfer dynamics between larger tasks (e.g., Image Classification and Image Generation), and between finer-grained tasks (e.g,. Image-to-Image Translation and Image Inpainting, which are both children of Image Generation).\nWe took three additional steps to pre-process the data. First, we only consider datasets that are used by others at least once. Second, because we found dataset usages in PWC to be noisy (i.e., a paper would be associated with a dataset if the corresponding dataset name appeared multiple times in the paper), we dropped dataset usages where the dataset-using paper shared no tasks in common with the dataset itself. 3 Second, we found 640 papers that introduced a dataset but were not associated with a task. Two authors manually annotated the top 90 most widely-used dataset papers with origin tasks (see GitHub for justifications and appendix for details). We dropped the remaining 550 dataset papers (accounting for only 10.2% of total usages).", "publication_ref": ["b32", "b2"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Datasets for Analysis 1 and 2 (RQ1, RQ2):", "text": "To minimize double-counting of dataset usages across parent tasks and child subtasks, we chose to focus exclusively on parent tasks in PWC. The outcome measures we use in these analyses (Gini, Adoption Proportion, and Creation Proportion) are biased in small samples, so we used only parent tasks above the median size of 34 papers (see GitHub for the list of tasks). Because these tasks were larger, we also felt that parent tasks tended to be more widely-recognized as coherent task communities. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the data used in each analysis. Analysis 1 explores dataset usage within tasks, so it includes datasets that are introduced in papers as well as those that are not (e.g., introduced on a website or competition). Analysis 2 explores the transfer of datasets between origin and destination tasks.

Gini is a continuous measure of dispersion in frequency distributions. It is frequently used in social science to study inequality [35]. 4 The Gini score varies between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that the papers within a task use all datasets in equal proportions, and 1 indicating that only a single dataset is used across all dataset-using papers. Gini is calculated as the average absolute difference in the usage of all pairs of datasets used in the task, divided by the average usage of datasets. Formally, if x i is the number of usages of dataset i out of all n datasets used in the task, then the Gini coefficient of dataset usage is,\nG = n i=1 n j=1 |xi \u2212 xj| 2 n i=1 n j=1 xj = n i=1 n j=1 |xi \u2212 xj| 2n n j=1 xj = n i=1 n j=1 |xi \u2212 xj| 2n 2x(1)\n5 Because Gini can be biased in small samples [36], we use the the sample-corrected Gini, G s = n n\u22121 G, and excluded tasks (or task-years when disaggregating by time) with fewer than 10 papers. Regression Model 1: In addition to descriptive statistics, we built a regression model to assess the extent to which observed trends in Gini from year-to-year could be attributable to confounding variables like task size, task age, or other task-specific traits at that time. Our outcome is G s in each task year from 2015-2020 (Figure A3 shows PWC coverage is limited for papers published before 2015). Our predictors of interest are:\n1. Year (since we are interested in trends in concentration over time) 2. CV, NLP, Methods 6 (three dummy variables indicating whether the task belongs to the Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, or Methodology categories in PWC).\nTo absorb additional variation, we also included the following control covariates:\n1. Task size in number of dataset-using/introducing papers for that task in that year 2. Task age (because younger tasks may have higher Gini coefficients) 3. Random intercepts for each task (because we have repeated observations over time)\nWe use beta regression to model Gini because the beta distribution is very flexible, between 0 and 1, and commonly used for this purpose [35]. However, we apply the smoothing transformation in [37] to deal with the occasional task-year where the Gini is 0. We use a model with the following interactions:\nBeta(Gs) = \u03b1 + \u03b21Year + \u03b22TaskSize + \u03b23TaskAge \u03b24CV + \u03b25NLP + \u03b26Methods + \u03b27Year * TaskSize + \u03b28CV * Year + \u03b29NLP * Year + \u03b210Methods * Year\nThis model was chosen among a set of nested models with two-and three-way interactions because it had the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC).

This trend is also visible in the overall distributions of Gini coefficients over this period (Figure 1 bottom). By 2020, the median Gini coefficient for a task was 0.60. There are no statistically significant differences between Computer Vision and Methodology tasks compared to the full sample (Figure 1 top, Figure A1), but Model 1 suggests that increases in concentration are attenuated for Natural Language Processing task communities (Figure 1 top orange). We note that this is the only result that varies somewhat with our model specification; while the rate of increasing concentration in NLP tasks is always significantly lower than the rest of the dataset, the sign and slope of this change does vary somewhat across models.\nWe discuss this point in the appendix.

In more than half of Computer Vision communities, authors adopt at least 71.9% of their datasets from a different task. The equivalent statistic in Methodology tasks is 74.1%. Conversely, half of Natural Language Processing communities adopt datasets less than 27.4% of the time.\nIn the bottom row of Figure 2, we see a largely inverted trend. Of all unique datasets used in a task community, 62.5% are created specifically for that task in more than half of tasks. Within Computer Vision and Methods tasks, the median is lower at 53.3% and 52.6%, with similar distributions across tasks. Most strikingly, 76.0% of datasets are created specifically for the task in more than half of NLP communities, with a much tighter variance.\nWe were unable to recover convincing evidence for trends in adoption or creation proportions either way (Regression Models 2A & 2B) because of a lack of data (results not shown).

In fact, over 50% of dataset usages in PWC as of June 2021 can be attributed to just twelve institutions. Moreover, this concentration on elite institutions as measured through Gini has increased to over 0.80 in recent years (Figure 3 right red). This trend is also observed in Gini concentration on datasets in PWC more generally (Figure 3 right black).

Moreover, a significant portion of the datasets being used for benchmarking purposes within these communities were originally developed for a different task (see Figure 2). This result is striking given the fact that communities are creating new datasets -in most cases more than the unique number that have been imported from other tasks -but the newly created datasets are being used at lower rates. When examining PWC without disaggregating by task category, we find that there is increasing inequality in dataset usage globally, and that more than 50% of all dataset usages in our sample of 43,140 corresponded to datasets introduced by twelve elite, primarily Western, institutions.\nNLP tasks differ somewhat from PWC as a whole: the broader trend of increasing concentration on a few datasets is moderated in NLP communities, new datasets are created at higher rates, and outside datasets are used at lower rates. One possible explanation for these findings is that NLP task communities in our dataset tend to be bigger than other task communities (median size of 76 dataset usages compared to 55). While we find very modest evidence of correlations between task size and adoption or creation proportions overall (Kendall's \u03c4 = \u2212.008, p = .89; \u03c4 = .014, p = .81 respectively), these correlations are stronger within NLP tasks (Kendall's \u03c4 = \u2212.10, p = .45; \u03c4 = .09, p = .50 respectively). It is possible that larger NLP communities are more coherent and thus generate and use their own datasets at higher rates than other task communities. Another possibility is that NLP datasets are easier to curate because the data are more accessible, easier to label, or smaller. The resolution of this puzzle is beyond the scope of this paper, but the distinct nature of NLP datasets provides an interesting direction for future work.\nFor our broader findings, there are valid reasons to expect widespread adoption and concentration on key datasets. First, a certain degree of research focus on a particular benchmark is both necessary and healthy to establish the validity and utility of the benchmark (or in some cases, to contest these properties) and to gain community alignment around the benchmark as a meaningful measure of progress. Second, the curation of large-scale datasets is not just costly in terms of resources, but may require unique or privileged data (e.g., anonymized medical records, self-driving car logs) accessible to only a few elite academic and corporate institutions. Nevertheless, the extent of concentration we observe poses questions relating to the scientific rigor and ecological validity of machine learning research and underscores benchmarking as a potential driver for inequality in the field. In the remainder of this section we discuss our findings in relation to these two broad themes and outline recommendations that can be enacted at an individual and institutional level. We close by discussing limitations of this analysis and outlining directions for future work.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_1", "fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Scientific Rigor and Ecological Validity of MLR", "text": "The heavy concentration of research on a small number of datasets for each task community is a fairly unsurprising result given the value placed on SOTA performance in established benchmark datasets -   [38], was developed for the task. (c) The small number of datasets in usage within the high stakes domain of Face Recognition. Two of the datasets, MegaFace [39] and MS-Celeb-1M [40] (in white), have been recently retracted, the latter due to serious ethical violations [41]. a valuation that incentivizes individual researchers to concentrate on maximizing performance gains on well-established benchmarks. However, as discussed in Section 2, over-concentration of research efforts on established benchmark datasets risks distorting measures of progress. Moreover, as the rate of technology transfer has accelerated, benchmarks have been increasingly used by industry practitioners to assess the suitability and robustness of different algorithms for live deployment in production settings. This transition has transformed epistemic concerns about overfitting datasets into ethical ones. For example, critical research on datasets for facial recognition, analysis, and classification has repeatedly highlighted the lack of diversity in standard benchmark datasets used to evaluate progress [4], even as the technologies are applied in law enforcement contexts that adversely affect underrepresented populations [42]. Figure 4c shows the top datasets in usage within the Face Recognition community. Here, we see a significant amount of high stakes research being concentrated on a small number of datasets, many of which contain significant racial and gender biases [4,43]. An in-depth examination of bias within the top benchmarks datasets in use within different task communities is outside the scope of this work. However, the systemic nature of bias concerns in ML datasets compounds the epistemic concerns associated with highly concentrated research.\nOur findings also indicate that datasets regularly transfer between different task communities. On the most extreme end, the majority of the benchmark datasets in circulation for some task communities were created for other tasks. For example, Figure 4 plots the dataset usages of Image Generation papers on PWC broken down by origin task (Figure 4a) and dataset name (Figure 4b). We observe that only one of the datasets heavily used in the Image Generation community was designed specifically for this task. The widespread practice of adopting established datasets to train and evaluate models in new problem domains isn't inherently a problem. However, this practice does raise potential concerns regarding the extent to which datasets are appropriately aligned with a given problem space. Moreover, given the widespread prevalence of systematic biases in the most prominent ML datasets, adopting existing datasets, rather than investing in careful curation of new datasets, risks further entrenching existing biases.\nOur findings on creation and adoption rates are quite nuanced. The extent to which high adoption rates raise significant concerns to ecological validity is yet to be determined. Furthermore, it is worth distinguishing between at least two forms of dataset adoption that seem to be conflated in the PWC data. On the one hand, we observe how datasets that have been developed for one task become adapted in some form for a new task through, for example, the addition of new annotations. On the other hand, we observe some datasets being imported whole cloth from one task community to another. Each of these forms of dataset adoption raises potentially unique concerns regarding the validity of the benchmark in a given context. That said, our results add empirical support to the growing body of scholarship calling for dataset development and use to be rooted in context [3,12], which is particularly important for application-oriented tasks.\nThis paper complements and supports the growing calls to include forms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations beyond top-line benchmark metrics [23,24,25,26]. Given the observed high concentration of research on a small number of benchmark datasets, we believe diversifying forms of evaluation is especially important to avoid overfitting to existing datasets and misrepresenting progress in the field.", "publication_ref": ["b37", "b38", "b39", "b40", "b3", "b41", "b3", "b42", "b2", "b11", "b22", "b23", "b24", "b25"], "figure_ref": ["fig_5", "fig_5", "fig_5", "fig_5"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Social Stratification in MLR", "text": "The extent of concentration we observe underscores that benchmarking is also a vehicle for inequality in science. The prima facie scientific validity granted by SOTA benchmarking is generically confounded with the social credibility researchers obtain by showing they can compete on a widely recognized dataset, even if a more context-specific benchmark might be more technically appropriate. We posit that these dynamics creates a \"Matthew Efffect\" (i.e. \"the rich get richer and the poor get poorer\") where successful benchmarks, and the elite institutions that introduce them, gain outsized stature within the field [44].\nInsofar as benchmarks shape the types of questions that get asked and the algorithms that get produced, current benchmarking practices offer a mechanism through which a small number of elite corporate, government, and academic institutions shape the research agenda and values of the field (Figure 3 left). Empirical support for this claim is beyond the scope of this paper, but there is work within the sociology of science and technology showing that government and corporate institutions tend to support research that serves (at least in part) their own interests, e.g., [45].\nThere is nothing a priori scientifically invalid about powerful institutions being interested in datasets or research agendas that would benefit them. However, issues arise when the values of these institutions are not aligned with those of other ML stakeholders (i.e., academics, civil society). For example, Dotan and Milli argue that deep learning's reliance on large datasets has forced MLR to confront decisions about the extent to which it is willing to violate privacy to acquire/curate data [2]. Corporate and government institutions have objectives that may come into conflict with privacy (e.g., surveillance), and their weighting of these priorities is likely to be different from those held by academics or AI's broader societal stakeholders. Returning to the Facial Recognition example in Figure 4c, four of the eight datasets (33.69% of total usages) were exclusively funded by corporations, the US military, or the Chinese government (MS-Celeb-1M, CASIA-Webface, IJB-A, VggFace2). MS-Celeb-1M was ultimately withdrawn because of controversy surrounding the value of privacy for different stakeholders [41].\nThe recently introduced NeurIPS Dataset and Benchmark Track is a clear example of an intervention that shifts incentive structures within the MLR community by rewarding dataset development and other forms of data work. We believe these sorts of interventions can play a critical role in incentivizing careful dataset development that is meaningfully aligned with problem domains. However, our finding that a small number of well-resourced institutions are responsible for most benchmarks in circulation today has implications for data-oriented interventions in the field. Our research suggests that simply calling for ML researchers to develop more datasets, and shifting incentive structures so that dataset development is valued and rewarded, may not be enough to diversify dataset usage and the perspectives that are ultimately shaping and setting MLR research agendas.

Moreover, the crowdsourced taxonomy of parent-child task relations in PWC may be subjective and/or noisy, especially for small or new tasks. 7 To increase our confidence in task annotations, we focused our analyses on larger, higher-level task communities and considered dataset usages invalid if they did not share a task label with the dataset. Lastly, we find that the concentration trends in Regression 1 are largely robust to model specification and our choice of Gini as an outcome. See the appendix for details on design choices and sensitivity analyses.\nFinally, we emphasize that our findings are highly nuanced. We report trends that our analyses revealed, but refrain from imposing normative judgements on many of these trends. For example, the high rates of adoption raise potential concerns and point to an important future area of examination.

We found that 58.9% of these papers appeared in PWC. However these 58.9% of papers accounted for 89.3% of collective citations received by the 46,774 papers, suggesting that the missing papers are primarily lower impact papers. When we disaggregated this analysis by year, we find that coverage ranges from 38.9% of 2015 papers to 68.8% of 2020 papers, but the proportion of citations covered in each year from 2015 on never drops below 86%.

To our understanding, the task ontology in PWC is purely crowd-sourced. We chose to focus on higher-level tasks in PWC that were parents to others because we wanted to minimize the double counting of dataset transfers, and were concerned that some of the smaller tasks might represent idiosyncratic labels by individuals rather than stable problem communities. We also chose to focus on the top 50% of parent communities with the most dataset usages (133 task communities with more than 34 usages, the median number of usages). This choice allowed us to reduce sample-size-related issues in our regression analyses and further sharpened our focus on the largest, most popular tasks. Below we describe how these choices affect Analyses 1 and 2 (Analysis 3 is task-independent).\nFor Analysis 1, when we focus on all 269 parent tasks instead of the 133 largest, there is still a significant increase in Gini over time for all but the smallest tasks. However, the interaction with NLP becomes statistically insignificant. When we do not disaggregate by time, the median Gini for the whole dataset drops from 0.72 to 0.65 (still quite large), with the smaller task communities tending to have lower Gini coefficients. If we include both children and parent tasks, this creates a different dataset by adding 1,164 additional tasks with a median task size of 7 aggregated across all years, and 3 when disaggregated across years. The significant increase in concentration over time is preserved, as is the significant interaction with NLP. Median Gini drops to 0.48 in this dataset. Nevertheless, we discourage interpretation of these findings because Gini is known to be biased in small samples [36].\nFor Analysis 2, when we focus on all 269 parent tasks instead of the 133 largest, the median creation proportion is stable at 62.5%. The median adoption proportion increases from 57.7% to 69.7%. Again we see similar patterns for the NLP community, where the median creation proportion is higher (75%) than the full dataset and the median adoption proportion is lower at 40%. When we include transfers between all 1,025 tasks, the proportions become increasingly biased as the median task size dips to 7, with a median creation proportion of 33% and a median adoption proportion of 100% (because community sizes are so small).", "publication_ref": ["b35"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Cleaning of spurious annotations", "text": "Our analyses on the cross-task transfer of datasets required that the dataset-introducing paper be labeled with origin tasks and the dataset-using papers be labeled with destination tasks. However, we found that some of the most widely-used datasets in PWC had no task annotations (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImagenNet). To include these datasets in our analyses, two authors went through each dataset-introducing paper and extracted evidence for specific PWC task labels. These annotations and justifications can be found in the GitHub. Starting with the raw data, we scraped 92,874 dataset usages from 46,697 dataset-using PWC papers labeled with tasks. Only 49,589 (53%) of those were to datasets already labeled with tasks in PWC. We first labeled the 45 highest-used datasets with their original tasks, skipping datasets that did not seem designed for MLR or where origin tasks were unidentifiable from language used in the paper or website. By manually labeling the 90 largest datasets with tasks, we recovered 33,739 usages, leaving just 10.2% of total dataset usages unlabeled with tasks across 550 datasets. It was too time-intensive for us to label these last 550 datasets. However, our results do not change when we include only 45 manually annotated datasets versus 90.\nWe can also relax the requirement that both the dataset and the focal dataset-using paper be labeled with an overlapping task in Analysis 3. For this analysis, this relaxation allows us to consider 78,289 usages (primarily algorithmically-labeled) of 2,174 datasets in 46,842 papers. Including these potentially noisy usages does not affect our findings: Gini still increases from 0.31 to 0.86 from 2011-2020 across datasets and from 0.38 to 0.80 across institutions.

Pielou evenness normalizes the observed Shannon entropy H(y) of dataset usages in each task-year by the maximum possible entropy in each task-year (i.e., the scenario where all datasets are used equally):\nJ(y) = H(y) H max (y) = \u2212 D i=1 1 D ln 1 D = ln D (2)\nwhere D is the number of datasets used at least once in the task-year.\nLike Gini, Pielou evenness is between 0 and 1, but interpretation runs in the opposite direction to Gini: higher numbers indicate high evenness (close to maximum entropy/maximum evenness), and low numbers indicate high concentration.\nAt 0.69, the median Pielou evenness across parent tasks is fairly high.
