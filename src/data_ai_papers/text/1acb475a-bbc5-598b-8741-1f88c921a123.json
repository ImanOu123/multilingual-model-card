With recent development of large-scale datasets (Choi et al., 2018;Saeidi et al., 2018;Reddy et al., 2019;Campos et al., 2020), rapid progress has been made in better modeling of conversational QA systems.\nCurrent conversational QA datasets are collected by crowdsourcing human-human conversations, where the questioner asks questions about a specific topic, and the answerer provides answers based on an evidence passage and the conversational history. When evaluating conversational QA systems, a set of held-out conversations are used for asking models questions in turn. Since the evaluation builds on pre-collected conversations, the gold history of the conversation is always provided, regardless of models' actual predictions (Figure 1(b)). Although current systems achieve near-human F1 scores on this static evaluation, it is questionable whether this can faithfully reflect models' true performance in real-world applications. To what extent do humanmachine conversations deviate from human-human conversations? What will happen if models have no access to ground-truth answers in a conversation?\nTo answer these questions and better understand the performance of conversational QA systems, we carry out the first large-scale human evaluation with four state-of-the-art models on the QuAC dataset (Choi et al., 2018) by having human evaluators converse with the models and judge the correctness of their answers. We collected 1,446 human-machine conversations in total, with 15,059 question-answer pairs. Through careful analysis, we notice a significant distribution shift from human-human conversations and identify a clear inconsistency of model performance between current evaluation protocol and human judgements.\nThis finding motivates us to improve automatic evaluation such that it is better aligned with human evaluation. Mandya et al. (2020); Siblini et al. (2021) identify a similar issue in gold-history evaluation and propose to use models' own predictions for automatic evaluation. However, predictedhistory evaluation poses another challenge: since all the questions have been collected beforehand, using predicted history will invalidate some of the questions because of changes in the conversational history (see Figure 1(c) for an example).\nFollowing this intuition, we propose a question Topic: Spandau Ballet (English pop band)\nWhat was the band's first success album at the international level?\nThey achieved platinum status.", "publication_ref": ["b4", "b29", "b28", "b2", "b4", "b19", "b34"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0", "fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "1985.", "text": "What year did this happen?\nWhat was the band's first success album at the international level?\nThey achieved platinum status.\n\"Only When You Leave\".\nWhat songs were in it?\nGold answer: \"Parade\" from 1984.\nWhat was the band's first success album at the international level?\nThey achieved platinum status.\n??? rewriting mechanism, which automatically detects and rewrites invalid questions with predicted history (Figure 4). We use a coreference resolution model (Lee et al., 2018) to detect inconsistency of conference in question text conditioned on predicted history and gold history, and then rewrite those questions by substituting with correct mentions, so that the questions are resolvable in the predicted context. Compared to predicted-history evaluation, we find that incorporating this rewriting mechanism aligns better with human evaluation.\nFinally, we also investigate the impact of different modeling strategies based on human evaluation. We find that both accurately detecting unanswerable questions and explicitly modeling question dependencies in conversations are crucial for model performance. Equipped with all the insights, we discuss directions for conversational QA modeling. We release our human evaluation dataset and hope that our findings can shed light on future development of better conversational QA systems.", "publication_ref": ["b15"], "figure_ref": ["fig_2"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Preliminary", "text": "2.1 Evaluation of conversational QA Evaluation of conversational QA in real-world consists of three components: an evidence passage P , a (human) questioner H that has no access to P , 2 and a model M that has access to P . The questioner asks questions about P and the model answers them based on P and the conversational history thus far (see an example in Figure 1(a)). Formally, for the i-th turn, the human asks a ques-2 Existing conversational QA datasets make different assumptions: For example, QuAC (Choi et al., 2018) assumes no access but CoQA assumes the questioner to have access. tion based on the previous conversation,\nQ i \u223c H(Q 1 , A 1 , ..., Q i\u22121 , A i\u22121 ),(1)\nand then the model answers it based on both the history and the passage,\nA i \u223c M(P, Q 1 , A 1 , ..., Q i\u22121 , A i\u22121 , Q i ), (2\n)\nwhere Q i and A i represent the question and the answer at the i-th turn. If the question is unanswerable from P , we simply denote A i as CANNOT ANSWER. The model M is then evaluated by the correctness of answers.\nEvaluating conversational QA systems requires human in the loop and is hence expensive. Instead, current benchmarks use automatic evaluation with gold history (Auto-Gold) and collect a set of humanhuman conversations for automatic evaluation. For each passage, one annotator asks questions without seeing the passage, while the other annotator provides the answers. Denote the collected questions and answers as Q * i and A * i . In gold-history evaluation, the model is inquired with pre-collected questions Q * i and the gold answers as history:\nA i \u223c M(P, Q * 1 , A * 1 , ..., Q * i\u22121 , A * i\u22121 , Q * i ), (3\n)\nand we evaluate the model by comparing A i to A * i (measured by word-level F1). This process does not require human effort but cannot truly reflect the distribution of human-machine conversations, because unlike human questioners who may ask different questions based on different model predictions, this static process ignores model predictions and always asks the pre-collected question.\nIn this work, we choose the QuAC dataset (Choi et al., 2018) as our primary evaluation because it is closer to real-world information-seeking conversations, where the questioner cannot see the evidence passage during the dataset collection. It prevents the questioner asking questions that simply overlaps with the passage and encourages unanswerable questions.

For each model and each passage, we collect three conversations from three different annotators.\nWe collect each conversation in two steps:\n(1) The annotator has no access to the passage and asks questions. The model extracts the answer span from the passage or returns CANNOT ANSWER in a human-machine conversation interface. 5 We provide the title, the section title, the background of the passage, and the first question from QuAC as a prompt to annotators. Annotators are required to ask at least 8 and at most 12 questions. We encourage context-dependent questions, but also allow open questions like \"What else is interesting?\" if asking a follow-up question is difficult. (2) After the conversation ends, the annotator is shown the passage and asked to check whether the model predictions are correct or not.\nWe noticed that the annotators are biased when evaluating the correctness of answers. For questions to which the model answered CANNOT ANSWER, annotators tend to mark the answer as incorrect without checking if the question is answerable.

The reason is that, in automatic evaluations, the gold answers cannot capture all possible correct answers to open-ended questions or questions with multiple answers; however, the human annotators can evaluate the correctness of answers easily. Nevertheless, we can compare relative rankings between different models.\nFigure 2 shows different trends between human evaluation and gold-history evaluation (Auto-Gold).

We make the assumption that if the coreference model resolves mentions in Q * i differently between using gold history (Q * 1 , A * 1 , ..., A * i\u22121 , Q * i ) and predicted history (Q * 1 , A 1 , ..., A i\u22121 , Q * i ), then Q * i is identified as having an unresolved coreference issue.\nThe inputs to the coreference model for Q * i are the following: where BG is the background, S * i and S i denote the inputs for gold and predicted history.

We find that Auto-Rewrite can detect invalid questions with a precision of 72% and a recall of 72% (more detailed analysis in Appendix B). An example of correctly detected and rewritten question is presented in Figure 4.\nQuestion replacement using CANARD. Another strategy is to replace the invalid questions with context-independent questions. The CANARD 7 We are only interested in the entities mentioned in the current question Q * i and we filter out named entities (e.g., the National Football League) because they can be understood without coreference resolution.\ndataset (Elgohary et al., 2019) provides such a resource, which contains human-rewritten contextindependent version of QuAC's questions. Recent works (Anantha et al., 2021;Elgohary et al., 2019) have proposed training sequence-to-sequence models on such dataset to rewrite questions; however, since the performance of the question-rewriting models is upper bounded by the human-rewritten version, we simply use CANARD for question replacement.

Statistics of unanswerable questions. Percentage of unanswerable questions is an important aspect in conversations. Automatic evaluations using static datasets have a fixed number of unanswerable questions, while in human evaluation, the percentage of unanswerable questions asked by human annotators varies with different models. The statistics of unanswerable questions is shown in Table 3.\nPairwise agreement. For a more fine-grained evaluation, we perform a passage-level comparison for every pair of models. More specifically, for every single passage we use one automatic metric to decide whether model A outperforms model B (or vice versa) and examine the percentage of passages that the automatic metric agrees with human evaluation. For example, if the pairwise agreement of BERT/ExCorD between human evaluation and Auto-Gold is 52%, it means that Auto-Gold and human evaluation agree on 52% passages in terms of which model is better. Higher agreement means the automatic evaluation is closer to human evaluation.

We draw this conclusion from the following points.\n\u2022 Human evaluation shows a much higher model performance than all automatic evaluations, as shown in Table 2. Two reasons may cause this large discrepancy: (a) Many conversational QA questions have multiple possible answers, and it is hard for the static dataset in automatic evaluations to capture all the answers. It is not an issue in human evaluation because all answers are judged by human evaluators. (b) There are more unanswerable questions and open questions in human evaluation (reason discussed in the next paragraph), which are easier-for example, models are almost always correct when answering questions like \"What else is interesting?\".\n\u2022 Human evaluation has a much higher unanswerable question rate, as shown in Table 3. The reason is that in human-human data collection, the answers are usually correct and the questioners can ask followup questions upon the highquality conversation; in human-machine interactions, since the models can make mistakes, the conversation flow is less fluent and it is harder to have followup questions. Thus, questioners chatting with models tend to ask more open or unanswerable questions.\n\u2022 All automatic evaluation methods have a pairwise agreement lower than 70% with human evaluation, as shown in Figure 2. This suggests that all automatic evaluations cannot faithfully reflect the model performance of human evaluation.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_1"], "table_ref": ["tab_5"]}, {"heading": "Auto-Rewrite is closer to human evaluation", "text": "First, we can clearly see that among all automatic evaluations, Auto-Gold deviates the most from the human evaluation. From Table 2, only Auto-Gold shows different rankings from human evaluation, while Auto-Pred, Auto-Rewrite, and Auto-Replace show consistent rankings to human judgments.\nIn Figure 2, we see that Auto-Gold has the lowest agreement with human evaluation; among others, Auto-Rewrite better agrees with human evaluation for most model pairs. Surprisingly, Auto-Rewrite is even better than Auto-Replace-which uses human-written context independent questions-in most cases. After checking the Auto-Replace conversations, we found that human-written context independent questions are usually much longer than QuAC questions and introduce extra information into the context, which leads to out-of-domain challenges for conversational QA models (example in Appendix C). It shows that our rewriting strategy can better reflect real-world performance of conversational QA systems. However, Auto-Rewrite is not perfect-we see that when comparing G/E or G/H, Auto-Pred is better than Auto-Rewrite; in all model pairs, the agreement between human evaluation and Auto-Rewrite is still lower than 70%. This calls for further effort in designing better automatic evaluation in the future.\n7 Towards Better Conversational QA With insights drawn from human evaluation and comparison with automatic evaluations, we discuss the impact of different modeling strategies, as well as future directions towards building better conversational question answering systems.\nModeling question dependencies on conversational context. When we focus on answerable questions (Table 2), we notice that GraphFlow, HAM and ExCorD perform much better than BERT. We compare the modeling differences of the four systems in Figure 6, and identify that all the three better systems explicitly model the question dependencies on the conversation history and the passage: both GraphFlow and HAM highlight repeated mentions in questions and conversation history by special embeddings (turn marker and PosHAE) and use attention mechanism to select the most relevant part from the context; ExCorD adopts a question rewriting module that generates context-independent questions given the history and passage. All those designs help models better understand the question in a conversational context. Figure 7 gives an example where GraphFlow, HAM and ExCorD resolved the question from long conversation history while BERT failed.\nUnanswerable question detection. Table 4 demonstrates models' performance in detecting unanswerable questions. We notice that Graph-Flow predicts much fewer unanswerable questions than the other three models, and has a high precision and a low recall in unanswerable detection. This is because GraphFlow uses a separate network for predicting unanswerable questions, which is harder to calibrate, while the other models jointly predict unanswerable questions and answer spans. This behavior has two effects: (a) GraphFlow's overall performance is dragged down by its poor unanswerable detection result (Table 2). (b) In human evaluation, annotators ask fewer unanswerable questions with GraphFlow (Table 3)-when the model outputs more, regardless of correctness, the human questioner has a higher chance to ask passage-related followup questions. Both suggest that how well the model detects unanswerable questions significantly affects its performance and the flow in human-machine conversations.\nOptimizing towards the new testing protocols. Most existing works on conversational QA modeling focus on optimizing towards Auto-Gold evaluation. Since Auto-Gold has a large gap from the real-world evaluation, more efforts are needed in optimizing towards the human evaluation, or Auto-Rewrite, which better reflects human evaluation. One potential direction is to improve models' robustness given noisy conversation history, which simulates the inaccurate history in real world that consists of models' own predictions. In fact, prior works (Mandya et al., 2020;Siblini et al., 2021) that used predicted history in training showed that it benefits the models in predicted-history evaluation.   (Adlakha et al., 2021;Anantha et al., 2021;Qu et al., 2020) Different from single-turn QA datasets (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), conversational QA requires the model to understand the question in the context of conversational history. There have been many methods proposed to improve conversational QA performance (Ohsugi et al., 2019;Chen et al., 2020;Qu et al., 2019b;Kim et al., 2021) and significant improvements have been made on conversational QA benchmarks. Besides text-based conversational QA tasks, there also exist conversational QA benchmarks that require external knowledge or other modalities (Saeidi et al., 2018;Saha et al., 2018;Guo et al., 2018;Das et al., 2017).", "publication_ref": ["b19", "b34", "b0", "b1", "b24", "b27", "b22", "b24", "b26", "b14", "b29", "b30", "b11", "b5"], "figure_ref": ["fig_1", "fig_4", "fig_5"], "table_ref": ["tab_5"]}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Only recently has it been noticed that the current method of evaluating conversational QA models is flawed.

Different from prior works, in this paper, we conduct a large scale human evaluation to provide evidence for why goldhistory evaluation is sub-optimal. In addition, we point out that even predicted-history evaluation has issues with invalid questions, for which we propose rewriting questions to further mitigate the gap.\nAutomatic evaluation of dialogue systems.

After manually checking 100 conversations of ExCorD from the QuAC development set, we find that Auto-Rewrite can detect invalid questions with a precision of 72% and a recall of 72%.\nWe notice that the coreference model sometimes detects the pronoun of the main character in the passage as insolvable, although it almost shows up in every question. This issue causes the low precision but is not a serious problem in our case -whether rewriting the pronoun of the main character does not affect models' prediction much, because the model always sees the passage and knows who the main character is.\nRewriting. Among all correctly detected invalid questions, we further check the quality of rewriting, and in 68% of the times Auto-Rewrite gives a correct context-independent questions. The most common error is being ungrammatical. For example, using the gold history of \"... Dee Dee claimed that Spector once pulled a gun on him\", the original question \"Did they arrest him for doing this?\" was rewritten to \"Did they arrest Phillip Harvey Spector for doing pulled?\" While this creates a distribution shift on question formats, it is still better than putting an invalid question in the flow.\nC Issue with Context Independent Questions Figure 9 shows an example where extra information in context-independent questions confuses the model and leads to incorrect prediction.
