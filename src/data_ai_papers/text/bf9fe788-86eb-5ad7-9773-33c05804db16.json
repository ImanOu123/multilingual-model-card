Document-level analysis of text structure is an important instance of such work. Previous research has sought to characterize texts in terms of domain-independent rhetorical elements, such as schema items (McKeown, 1985) or rhetorical relations (Mann and Thompson, 1988;Marcu, 1997). The focus of our work, however, is on an equally fundamental but domaindependent dimension of the structure of text: content.\nOur use of the term \"content\" corresponds roughly to the notions of topic and topic change. We desire models that can specify, for example, that articles about earthquakes typically contain information about quake strength, location, and casualties, and that descriptions of casualties usually precede those of rescue efforts. But rather than manually determine the topics for a given domain, we take a distributional view, learning them directly from un-annotated texts via analysis of word distribution patterns. This idea dates back at least to Harris (1982), who claimed that \"various types of [word] recurrence patterns seem to characterize various types of discourse\". Advantages of a distributional perspective include both drastic reduction in human effort and recognition of \"topics\" that might not occur to a human expert and yet, when explicitly modeled, aid in applications.\nOf course, the success of the distributional approach depends on the existence of recurrent patterns. In arbitrary document collections, such patterns might be too variable to be easily detected by statistical means. However, research has shown that texts from the same domain tend to exhibit high similarity (Wray, 2002). Cognitive psychologists have long posited that this similarity is not accidental, arguing that formulaic text structure facilitates readers' comprehension and recall (Bartlett, 1932). 1 In this paper, we investigate the utility of domainspecific content models for representing topics and topic shifts.\nContent models are Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) wherein states correspond to types of information characteristic to the domain of interest (e.g., earthquake magnitude or previous earthquake occurrences), and state transitions capture possible information-presentation orderings within that domain.\nWe first describe an efficient, knowledge-lean method for learning both a set of topics and the relations between topics directly from un-annotated documents. Our technique incorporates a novel adaptation of the standard HMM induction algorithm that is tailored to the task of modeling content.\nThen, we apply techniques based on content models to two complex text-processing tasks. First, we consider information ordering, that is, choosing a sequence in which to present a pre-selected set of items; this is an essential step in concept-to-text generation, multi-document summarization, and other text-synthesis problems. In our experiments, content models outperform Lapata's (2003) state-of-the-art ordering method by a wide margin -for one domain and performance metric, the gap was 78 percentage points. Second, we consider extractive summa-rization: the compression of a document by choosing a subsequence of its sentences. For this task, we develop a new content-model-based learning algorithm for sentence selection. The resulting summaries yield 88% match with human-written output, which compares favorably to the 69% achieved by the standard \"leading sentences\" baseline.\nThe success of content models in these two complementary tasks demonstrates their flexibility and effectiveness, and indicates that they are sufficiently expressive to represent important text properties. These observations, taken together with the fact that content models are conceptually intuitive and efficiently learnable from raw document collections, suggest that the formalism can prove useful in an even broader range of applications than we have considered here; exploring the options is an appealing line of future research.", "publication_ref": ["b18", "b16", "b17", "b9", "b27", "b0", "b15"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Knowledge-rich methods Models employing manual crafting of (typically complex) representations of content have generally captured one of three types of knowledge (Rambow, 1990;Kittredge et al., 1991): domain knowledge [e.g., that earthquakes have magnitudes], domainindependent communication knowledge [e.g., that describing an event usually entails specifying its location]; and domain communication knowledge [e.g., that Reuters earthquake reports often conclude by listing previous quakes 2 ]. Formalisms exemplifying each of these knowledge types are DeJong's (1982) scripts, McKeown's (1985) schemas, and Rambow's (1990) domain-specific schemas, respectively.\nIn contrast, because our models are based on a distributional view of content, they will freely incorporate information from all three categories as long as such information is manifested as a recurrent pattern. Also, in comparison to the formalisms mentioned above, content models constitute a relatively impoverished representation; but this actually contributes to the ease with which they can be learned, and our empirical results show that they are quite effective despite their simplicity.\nIn recent work, Duboue and McKeown (2003) propose a method for learning a content planner from a collection of texts together with a domain-specific knowledge base, but our method applies to domains in which no such knowledge base has been supplied. Knowledge-lean approaches Distributional models of content have appeared with some frequency in research on text segmentation and topic-based language modeling (Hearst, 1994;Beeferman et al., 1997;Chen et al., 1998;Florian and Yarowsky, 1999;Gildea and Hofmann, 1999;Iyer and Ostendorf, 1996;Wu and Khudanpur, 2002). In fact, the methods we employ for learning content models are quite closely related to techniques proposed in that literature (see Section 3 for more details).\nHowever, language-modeling research -whose goal is to predict text probabilities -tends to treat topic as a useful auxiliary variable rather than a central concern; for example, topic-based distributional information is generally interpolated with standard, non-topic-based -gram models to improve probability estimates. Our work, in contrast, treats content as a primary entity. In particular, our induction algorithms are designed with the explicit goal of modeling document content, which is why they differ from the standard Baum-Welch (or EM) algorithm for learning Hidden Markov Models even though content models are instances of HMMs.", "publication_ref": ["b22", "b13", "b4", "b18", "b22", "b5", "b10", "b2", "b3", "b7", "b8", "b11", "b28"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Model Construction", "text": "We employ an iterative re-estimation procedure that alternates between (1) creating clusters of text spans with similar word distributions to serve as representatives of within-document topics, and (2) computing models of word distributions and topic changes from the clusters so derived. 3", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Formalism preliminaries", "text": "We treat texts as sequences of pre-defined text spans, each presumed to convey information about a single topic. Specifying text-span length thus defines the granularity of the induced topics. For concreteness, in what follows we will refer to \"sentences\" rather than \"text spans\" since that is what we used in our experiments, but paragraphs or clauses could potentially have been employed instead.\nOur working assumption is that all texts from a given domain are generated by a single content model. A content model is an HMM in which each state \u00a1 corresponds to a distinct topic and generates sentences relevant to that topic according to a state-specific language model \u00a2 \u00a4 \u00a3 note that standard -gram language models can therefore be considered to be degenerate (single-state) content models. State transition probabilities give the probability of changing from a given topic to another, thereby capturing constraints on topic shifts. We can use the forward algorithm to efficiently compute the generation probability assigned to a document by a content model and the Viterbi algorithm to quickly find the most likely contentmodel state sequence to have generated a given document; see Rabiner (1989) for details.\nIn our implementation, we use bigram language models, so that the probability of an -word sentence", "publication_ref": ["b20"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "\u00a5 \u00a7 \u00a6\u00a8 \u00a9", "text": "being generated by a state\n\u00a1 is \u00a2 \u00a4 \u00a3 \" ! # \u00a5 % $ ' & ( 0 ) \u00a6 1 ,2 , 3 \" 4 , and 3 6 5\nare chosen.

First, we create clusters via complete-link clustering, measuring sentence similarity by the cosine metric using word bigrams as features (Figure 1 shows example output). 4 Then, given our knowledge that documents may sometimes discuss new and/or irrelevant content as well, we create an \"etcetera\" cluster by merging together all clusters containing fewer than sentences, on the assumption that such clusters consist of \"outlier\" sentences.

Our state-transition probability estimates arise from considering how sentences from the same article are distributed across the clusters. More specifically, for two clusters Viterbi re-estimation Our initial clustering ignores sentence order; however, contextual clues may indicate that sentences with high lexical similarity are actually on different \"topics\". For instance, Reuters articles about earthquakes frequently finish by mentioning previous quakes. This means that while the sentence \"The temblor injured dozens\" at the beginning of a report is probably highly salient and should be included in a summary of it, the same sentence at the end of the piece probably refers to a different event, and so should be omitted.\nA natural way to incorporate ordering information is iterative re-estimation of the model parameters, since the content model itself provides such information through its transition structure. We take an EM-like Viterbi approach (Iyer and Ostendorf, 1996): we re-cluster the sentences by placing each one in the (new) cluster \u00a1 , \" e , that corresponds to the state \u00a1 \u00a1 most likely to have generated it according to the Viterbi decoding of the training data. We then use this new clustering as the input to the procedure for estimating HMM parameters described above.

We demonstrate this point by utilizing content models to select appropriate sentence orderings: we simply use a content model trained on documents from the domain of interest, selecting the ordering among all the presented candidates that the content model assigns the highest probability to.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Extractive Summarization", "text": "Content models can also be used for single-document summarization. Because ordering is not an issue in this application 5 , this task tests the ability of content models to adequately represent domain topics independently of whether they do well at ordering these topics.\nThe usual strategy employed by domain-specific summarizers is for humans to determine a priori what types of information from the originating documents should be included (e.g., in stories about earthquakes, the number of victims) (Radev and McKeown, 1998;White et al., 2001). Some systems avoid the need for manual analysis by learning content-selection rules from a collection of articles paired with human-authored summaries, but their learning algorithms typically focus on withinsentence features or very coarse structural features (such as position within a paragraph) (Kupiec et al., 1999). Our content-model-based summarization algorithm combines the advantages of both approaches; on the one hand, it learns all required information from un-annotated document-summary pairs; on the other hand, it operates on a more abstract and global level, making use of the topical structure of the entire document.\nOur algorithm is trained as follows. Given a content model acquired from the full articles using the method described in Section 3, we need to learn which topics (represented by the content model's states) should appear in our summaries. Our first step is to employ the Viterbi algorithm to tag all of the summary sentences and all of the sentences from the original articles with a Viterbi topic label, or V-topic -the name of the state most likely to have generated them. Next, for each state \u00a1 such that at least three full training-set articles contained V-topic \u00a1 , we compute the probability that the state generates sentences that should appear in a summary. This probability is estimated by simply (1) counting the number of document-summary pairs in the parallel training data such that both the originating document and the summary contain sentences assigned V-topic \u00a1 , and then (2) normalizing this count by the number of full articles containing sentences with V-topic \u00a1 . 5 Typically, sentences in a single-document summary follow the order of appearance in the original document. To produce a length-summary of a new article, the algorithm first uses the content model and Viterbi decoding to assign each of the article's sentences a V-topic. Next, the algorithm selects those states, chosen from among those that appear as the V-topic of one of the article's sentences, that have the highest probability of generating a summary sentence, as estimated above. Sentences from the input article corresponding to these states are placed in the output summary. 6", "publication_ref": ["b21", "b26", "b14"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Evaluation Experiments", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Data", "text": "For evaluation purposes, we created corpora from five domains: earthquakes, clashes between armies and rebel groups, drug-related criminal offenses, financial reports, and summaries of aviation accidents. 7 Specifically, the first four collections consist of AP articles from the North American News Corpus gathered via a TDT-style document clustering system. The fifth consists of narratives from the National Transportation Safety Board's database previously employed by Jones and Thompson (2003) for event-identification experiments.

However, one stumbling block to performing this kind of evaluation is that we do not have data on ordering quality: the set of sentences from an \u00a4 -sentence document can be sequenced in \u00a4 \u00a6 \u00a5 different ways, which even for a single text of moderate length is too many to ask humans to evaluate. Fortunately, we do know that at least the original sentence order (OSO) in the source document must be acceptable, and so we should prefer algorithms that assign it high probability relative to the bulk of all the other possible permutations. This observation motivates our first evaluation metric: the rank received by the OSO when all permutations of a given document's sentences are sorted by the probabilities that the model under consideration assigns to them. The best possible rank is 0, and the worst is\n\u00a4 \u00a6 \u00a5 @ 9\n. An additional difficulty we encountered in setting up our evaluation is that while we wanted to compare our algorithms against Lapata's (2003) state-of-the-art system, her method doesn't consider all permutations (see below), and so the rank metric cannot be computed for it. To compensate, we report the OSO prediction rate, which measures the percentage of test cases in which the model under consideration gives highest probability to the OSO from among all possible permutations; we expect that a good model should predict the OSO a fair fraction of the time. Furthermore, to provide some assessment of the quality of the predicted orderings themselves, we follow Lapata (2003) in employing Kendall's \u00a7 , which is a measure of how much an ordering differs from the OSOthe underlying assumption is that most reasonable sentence orderings should be fairly similar to it. Specifically, for a permutation\u00a8of the sentences in an\n\u00a4 -sentence document, \u00a7! \u00a9$ i s computed as \u00a7! $\u00a6 9 A @ ! $ where ! \u00a9$\nis the number of swaps of adjacent sentences necessary to re-arrange\u00a8into the OSO.

We compared our results against those of a bigram language model (the baseline) and an improved version of the state-of-the-art probabilistic ordering method of Lapata ( 2003), both trained on the same data we used. Lapata's method first learns a set of pairwise sentenceordering preferences based on features such as noun-verb dependencies. Given a new set of sentences, the latest version of her method applies a Viterbi-style approximation algorithm to choose a permutation satisfying many preferences (Lapata,personal communication). 9 Table 2 gives the results of our ordering-test comparison experiments. Content models outperform the alternatives almost universally, and often by a very wide margin. We conjecture that this difference in performance stems from the ability of content models to capture global document structure. In contrast, the other two algorithms are local, taking into account only the relationships between adjacent word pairs and adjacent sentence pairs, respectively. It is interesting to observe that our method achieves better results despite not having access to the linguistic information incorporated by Lapata's method. To be fair, though, her techniques were designed for a larger corpus than ours, which may aggravate data sparseness problems for such a feature-rich method.\nTable 3 gives further details on the rank results for our content models, showing how the rank scores were distributed; for instance, we see that on the Earthquakes domain, the OSO was one of the top five permutations in 95% of the test documents. Even in Drugs and Accidents -the domains that proved relatively challenging to our method -in more than 55% of the cases the OSO's rank did not exceed ten. Given that the maximal possible rank in these domains exceeds three million, we believe that our model has done a good job in the ordering task.\nWe also computed learning curves for the different domains; these are shown in Figure 2. Not surprisingly, performance improves with the size of the training set for all domains. The figure also shows that the relative difficulty (from the content-model point of view) of the different domains remains mostly constant across varying trainingset sizes. Interestingly, the two easiest domains, Finance and Earthquakes, can be thought of as being more formulaic or at least more redundant, in that they have the highest token/type ratios (see Table 1) -that is, in these domains, words are repeated much more frequently on average.

To address question (2), we consider a summarization system that learns extraction rules directly from a parallel corpus of full texts and their summaries (Kupiec et al., 1999). In this system, summarization is framed as a sentence-level binary classification problem: each sentence is labeled by the publiclyavailable BoosTexter system (Schapire and Singer, 2000) as being either \"in\" or \"out\" of the summary. The features considered for each sentence are its unigrams and its location within the text, namely beginning third, middle third and end third. 10 Hence, relationships between sentences are not explicitly modeled, making this system a good basis for comparison.\nWe evaluated our summarization system on the Earthquakes domain, since for some of the texts in this domain there is a condensed version written by AP journalists. These summaries are mostly extractive 11 ; consequently, they can be easily aligned with sentences in the original articles. From sixty document-summary pairs, half were randomly selected to be used for training and the other half for testing. (While thirty documents may not seem like a large number, it is comparable to the size of the training corpora used in the competitive summarizationsystem evaluations mentioned above.) The average number of sentences in the full texts and summaries was 15 and 6, respectively, for a total of 450 sentences in each of the test and (full documents of the) training sets.\nAt runtime, we provided the systems with a full document and the desired output length, namely, the length in sentences of the corresponding shortened version. The resulting summaries were judged as a whole by the fraction of their component sentences that appeared in the human-written summary of the input text.\nThe results in Table 4 confirm our hypothesis about the benefits of content models for text summarizationour model outperforms both the sentence-level, locallyfocused classifier and the \"lead\" baseline. Furthermore, as the learning curves shown in Figure 3 indicate, our method achieves good performance on a small subset of parallel training data: in fact, the accuracy of our method on one third of the training data is higher than that of the    sentence-level classifier on the full training set.
