{"title": "", "authors": "A Jon; Robert Hickman; Christopher L Miller", "pub_date": "", "abstract": "Furthermore, because the representatives used the same telephone number, address, and business identity for the CD-finder service as they used for their securities business, no meaningful distinction was drawn between the CD-finder service and the securities business the representatives did through KCD. From the customers' perspective, the CDs and securities were offered and sold by the same person from the same office as part ofthe same business. Finally, the Firm was aware of; or at least turned a blind eye to, the nature and function of the advertising. It conducted an initial review ofthe Florida office advertising, and acknowledged at the time ofthat review that the CD advertising could result in securities lransactions. The Finn also knew that the purpose ofthe Arizona CD-finder service was to generate''goodwill\" and potential customers for the representatives' other businesses, including their securities business through KCD. The Second Cause ofAction. The Second Cause ofAction charges that the Firm violated NASD Rule 3010, concerning supervisory responsibilities, and FINRA Rule 2010, by failing to supervise appropriately the activities ofKCD's registered representatives at a Dallas, Texas office, and permitting the representatives to offer and sell unregistered securities that were not exempt from registration. The securities were for an investment fund that was to use the proceeds of the offering to invest in dislressed real estate. The securities were purportedly entitled to an exemption from regislration under Rule 506 ofRegulation D ofthe Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). That exemption is available only if there is no general solicitation of the public. Whether the securities were entitled to the exemption became an issue because oftwo news articles published in local Dallas newspapers discussing the offering and the investment fund's prospects. One ofthe articles was also posted on the website of the Dallas office for at least six months, while the representatives continued to offer and sell the unregistered securities. The Firm argues that the news articles were not a general solicitation, and that, in any event, the Firm sufficiently corrected any problem by instructing its registered representatives not to sell the securities to anyone who had learned ofthe offering because ofone ofthe news articles. The Firm asserts that it limited sales to pre-existing customers. The Hearing Panel rejects both ofthe Firm's arguments. The news articles, which were widely distributed, constituted a general solicitation. Indeed, at least one person sought to purchase the security as a result of seeing the news article, confirming that the article was viewed by the general public as a solicitation for buyers. In fact, KCD was on notice that the securities attorney who had worked on the offering was concerned that there had been a breach ofthe rules relating to registration and exemption. Selling only to pre-existing customers was not a cure for the violation. Once the unregistered securities were the subject of a general solicitation, they were not entitled to an 3 exemption from registration. Without an exemption, the unregistered securities could not be offered or sold. Accordingly, the Hearing Panel finds that the Firm committed the violations alleged in the Complaint and imposes sanctions, as discussed below. II.The hearing took place for three days on December 16-18, 2014.3  The Parties filed posthearing briefs on January 30, 2015.4This proceeding combines examinations initially conducted by different FINRA offices. FINRA's Florida District Office conducted a s?cause\" examination ofKCD registered representative EW, in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida after receiving a regulatory tip that he was running advertisements for CDs at above-market rates. The tip suggested that the advertisements could be used to prey on seniors. The stafTconducted an unannounced on-site visit. EW explained his CD-finder service to the staff. The staff then referred sample advertisements to the Advertising Regulation Department. After studying the samples, the Advertising Regulation Department had concerns that the advertisements were misleading. 5 FINRA's Chicago District Office was at the same time conducting a \"cycle\" examination of KCD, and it had identified similar problems with other advertisements. The Florida inquiry into EW's advertising was then referred to the Chicago District Office so that it could be consolidated with the cycle examination.6 ?

Thus, testimony of a FINRA examiner is cited \"Hearing Tr. (Foye) 59.\" The following people testified at the hearing: Peter Foye (\"Foye\"), a FINRA principal examiner; David Wegner (\"Wegner\"), a FINRA examination manager; Kimberly Flanders (\"Flanders\"), a FINRA principal investigator in the Advertising Regulation Department; Eugene Teh ('Teh\"), a FINRA principal examiner; Jeff Allen Katz (\"Katz\"), the owner of the Sun Cities Financial Group, who was registered with KCD at the time of the events at issue; Linda Bradle (\"Bradle\"), a former Chief Compliance Officer with KCD; Isaac D. Gregory (\"Gregory'), who was responsible for supervising FINRA registered salespeople at the Dallas office affiliated with KCD; and Lori Lee Rastall(\"Rastall\"), KCD's current Chief Compliance Officer and FINOP. 4 The briefs were entitled as follows: The Department OfEnforcement's Post-Hearing Brief(\"Enf. PH Br.\"); and KCD Financial, Inc.'s Post-Hearing Brief(\"KCD PH Br.\").", "sections": [{"heading": "", "text": "The cycle examination focused on KCD's Sun City, Arizona office in part because of a customer complaint. The customer complained that she had responded to a CD advertisement, but when she went to the Sun City office she felt pressured to buy something different. She ultimately purchased a fixed annuity.7 While on-site at the Sun City, Arizona office, a FINRA examiner saw an advertisement in the Firm's branch office files that caught her attention because it had the word '?guarantee\" on it.\nIt also advertised an interest rate that was in the 3% to 4% range, which seemed high.8 FINRA staff then researched the current market rate for CDs and found that the market rate was closer to 1% than to 3%.9 FINRA staffconsidered the advertisements to be member communications covered by NASD Rule 2210 (even though the advertisements do not mention securities or KCD) because the purpose, at least in part, was to offer securities through KCD. The advertisements were the first step in marketing securities through KCLI. The First Cause ofAction covers both the -10 Florida and the Arizona advertisements.\nThe cycle examination ofKCD uncovered a separate problem that is the subject ofthe Second Cause ofAction. That problem had to do with the Firm's due diligence in connection with the private placement of securities by the Firm's Dallas, Texas office. The private placement offering was for an investment fund sponsored by an affiliate of the KCD Dallas investment rate more than twice the market rate. The advertisements failed to explain that the registered representative planned to make up the difference between the market rate and the rate advertised.\nThe fact that, after a customer insisted on buying a CD as advertised, EW may have revealed that he would be paying some ofthe interest on the CD out ofhis own pocket does not 34 alter the false and misleading nature of the advertisement. Nor did the small print disclosure concerning a \"promotional incentive\" cure the problem. The small print was too insignificant within the context of the advertisement as a whole, and the words were too cryptic, to counteract the overall impression conveyed by the advertisement. 35 The Hearing Panel further finds that the advertisements were false and misleading because they did not reveal their true purpose. Tile so-called CD-finder service was no more than a marketing tool for the other businesses operated under the Principal First name, including the securities business EW conducted as a KCD branch office. As EW operated it, the so-called CD-finder service had no value whatsoever as an independent business. It was neither intended nor structured to generate a penny of revenue.\nThe Hearing Panel rejects the Firm's assertion that the advertisements had nothing to do with it. Although the Firm claimed to FINRA staffthat it was unaware ofEW's CD-finder service,36 that claim is contradicted by the fact that it conducted an initial review of the advertising in substantially the same false and misleading form as the later advertisements that 34 Hearing Tr. (Foye) 89-90. The disclosure that EW was making up the difference between the advertised rate and the true rate of an existing CD actually added to the misleading nature of the advertising. A customer might think that the disclosure showed that EW was honest, because he was attempting to live up to the promise in the advertisement, as opposed to focusing on the fact that the advertisement promised something EW could not deliver. Furthermore, learning that EW would be paying some ofthe promised return on the CD out ofhis own pocket could play a role in persuading customers to buy other financial products from him, including securities, out of a misplaced sense of trust or reciprocity. a distinction between \"current management\" and \"former management,\" saying that \"current management\" was unaware of EW's advertising but that --former management\" had reviewed a marketing piece in 2007 that was \"substantively similar\" to advertisements provided to FINRA in 2009. The Firm further explained that not only did it review the advertising but it discussed the nature of the activity with EW at some unspecified point in time. The Firm wrote to FINRA staff that \"former managemenf' had concluded that the CD-finder senrice was an outside business activity that needed no further review, and \"current management\" had relied on \"former management's\" conclusion when it decided it did not need to approve or disapprove ofthe advertising. At some unspecified point, the Firm also knew that EW did not se11 existing CDs but, rather, in at least some instances, packaged CDs together with a promotional incentive to achieve the advertised interest rate. RX-23, at 2-3.\nWhether under former or current management, the Firm was still the Firm. Its knowledge and responsibility continued even if management changed. to be contacted to learn about the CDs. In his testimony, Katz referred to the advertisements as a CD-locator service. 40 The Sun Cities Financial CD advertisements contained small print disclosures relating to the hybrid nature of the offered product-part annual rate, part bonus. Witnesses discussed a typical advertisement as an example. It disclosed in small print that the advertised interest rate 41 was composed of a 1.06% annual percentage yield and a 1.96% interest bonus. But, as one witness testified, the print was so small that it was nearly impossible to read.42 The Hearing Panel finds that the physical contrast between the small print disclosing the bonus and the large type advertising the false, above-market rate made the small print insufficient to correct the misimpression created by the advertisement-the misimpression that there was an existing high-yield CD when there was no such CD. Moreover, even ifthe small print could be read, the Hearing Panel finds that the disclosure was too cryptic to inform the reader that there was, in reality, no CD at the rate advertised. The small print did not inform the reader who was offering the bonus, why it was offered, or how it would work.\nThe CD-locator service run by Sun Cities Financial worked much the same way as the CD-finder service run in Florida. LP testified in his OTR that he would arrange an in-person meeting at his office when a prospective customer telephoned in response to a CD advertisement. He would ask about his or her financial situation, needs, and objectives. Then he would move 43 into discussing products. Katz confirmed in his testimony at the hearing that no one could open a CD over the telephone. Rather, interested persons had to come into the office and fill out paperwork.44 At the Sun City office, the other products that might be discussed included securities. 45 The CD advertisements contained no disclosures relating to securities or KCD, but they did refer the viewer to the Sun Cities Financial Group website. The website had securities broker-dealer 46 disclosures on it. The Hearing Panel finds the reference to the Sun Cities Financial website an insufficient disclosure of the connection between the advertising and possible securities transactions through KCD. At the same time, this reference to the website establishes the connection between the CD advertisements and the KCD representatives' securities business. 40 Hearing Tr. (Katz) 302-03,385; JX-6. Katz testified that the Sun City office did not itself sell CDs, but rather \"located\" CDs for clients, which the clients could then purchase or \"open,\" dealing directly with a bank Hearing Tr.

(Wegner) 190;  The purpose ofthe Sun Cities Financial CD advertisements was to get customers to come to a Sun Cities Financial office, enabling its representatives to establish and develop a relationship with the customers. Sun Cities Financial did not charge customers for the so-called CD-locator service, and its representatives did not earn any money when a customer decided to purchase a CD identified for the customer by Sun Cities Financial. The only way any Sun Cities Financial representative made money is ifthe representative could sell products other than CDs, 47 including securities. In his testimony, Katz described the service as a way of generating leads for other products, not by itself as a means to generate income. 48 In March 2009, Katz provided to KCD, and KCD provided to FINRA staff in response to prior regulatory inquiries, a descIiption of Sun Cities Financial's CD-locator service. KCD described the CD advertising in its response to FINRA staff as marketing for other financial 49 products. KCD also expressly linked the CD marketing to potential securities transactions. Its then CCO, Linda Bradle, wrote to FINRA staff that after a client was satisfied with the CD service, \"Mr. Katz may subsequently sell securities.... ,,50\nAt the hearing, Katz testified that he provided the CD-finder service to seniors who were unable to locate the CDs on the internet for themselves. He told the former CCO ofKCD, It is significant that Katz did not mention any securities business advertising. That means that LP, the other registered representative at the Sun City office, who was one ofthe top producers at KCD, developed his substantial securities business from the customer base generated by the non-securities advertising, the CD and fixed annuity advertising. During the relevant period, LP was KCD's fourth highest producer or commission-earning registered representative, and the Sun City branch was a high producing branch ofKCD.57 It is also significant that Katz told the former CCO, Bradle, that he operated the CDlocator service to generate goodwill. This should have signaled to the CCO the connection between the CD advertising and Katz's other businesses, including the Sun City office's securities business. Furthermore, Katz testified that every twelve months he updated the outside business activity form for KCD, and when he did so, ifhe was offering bonus CD's at the time he informed KCD that he was doing that. He claimed that he made KCD aware of everything he 58 was doing at the time. If so, then KCD was informed that Katz was using the advertisements for the so-called CD-locator service to draw in potential customers for his other businesses, including his securities business through KCD.\nIndeed, a May 5,2009 letter from Bradle to Katz, copied to the then-president ofKCD,\nshows that KCD understood the connection between the CD-advertising and potential securities sales. The letter was written in connection with KCD's determination to lift a cease-and-desist instruction that the Firm had imposed in response to regulatory inquiries prior to the examinations that led to this proceeding. The Firm'S cease-and-desist order had prohibited Katz from engaging in activities related to his CD-locator service. Bradle's letter lifting the ceaseand-desist order refers to the potential that a customer might decide to use the proceeds from a maturing CD in a securities transaction. In the letter, Bradle wrote, \"[W]e believe there will [be] clients wishing to use CD proceeds to fund a security transaction.... She reiterated at the ,,59 conclusion that the letter was intended to \"support your activities as it relates to the use of CD proceeds in the event there is a securities lransaction involved. ,,60\nIn his hearing testimony, however, Katz attempted to minimize the connection between the CD advertising and the securities business at the Sun City office. He testified that it was rare that a customer who responded to a CD or annuity advertisement would have any interest in a security. He claimed that he did not initiate a discussion of a securities purchase with such customers because they were interested in safety of their investment. 61 Katz's testimony in this regard was not credible because it was inconsistent with a summary of2011 securities purchases that was prepared under his supervision to give to FINRA. That summary showed that at least 25 customers who purchased securities from the Sun City Financial representatives in 201 1 had also bought CDs at some point (not necessarily in 2011, but before). Some ofthe securities customers had purchased multiple CDs over the course of 62 years. Four customers who bought securities in 2011 also bought a CD the same day. Katz's testimony also was inconsistent with the fact that LP was one ofKCD's highest producers in terms of commission earnings on securities lransactions.\nKatz's testimony also was not credible because it became apparent at the hearing that he had previously concealed the truth in response to regulatory inquiries. FINRA had asked KCD, pursuant to Rule 8210, whether Sun Cities Financial had ever advertised a CD with a higher yield than the CD was actually paying. With knowledge that his response would be conveyed to the regulators, Katz told KCD the answer was no. But the answer was actually yes. He had placed advertisements for CDs at a rate that was a combination of the highest rate possible plus a bonus that he would pay.\n63 Katz attempted to explain away his failure to provide the whole truth in response to FINRA's prior investigative inquiries. He said that he did not understand the question posed by FINRA staffto encompass the advertisements that combined the highest rate CD with an additional bonus. 64 The Hearing Panel finds his testimony on this point was evasive and not credible.\nKatz also attempted to minimize the amount of securities business done in the Sun City office, testifying that its securities business was ''very miniscule compared to our insurance business and CD business.\nThat testimony is not consistent with other evidence. LP was one ,,65 ofKCD's top producers, which meant that the securities business at the Sun City office was more than?miniscule.\" Furthermore, KCD's own summary exhibit showed that during the period from 2009 through 2012, the Sun City office had 199 securities transactions. During that same period, the Sun City office had 1867 annuity sales and 617 CD transactions. However, the 62 Hearing Tr. (Wegner) 118-24; JX-8. See also Hearing Tr.  Hearing Tr. (Katz) 359-64; CX-4; RX-6. Katz described a di?erent kind of \"bonus CD\" to KCD. He told KCD's CCO that sometimes CD market rates changed between the time ofrunning an advertisement and the time that a customer came into the office to obtain the CD at the advertised rate. In such a situation, he would make up the difference with a\"bonus.\" Hearing Tr. (Bradle) 406-07.\nCD transactions generated no revenue. The revenue-generating transactions (annuities plus securities) in the office totaled 2066. Thus, securities transactions comprised approximately 9.6% ofthe total number ofrevenue generating transactions at the Sun City office. 66 In sum, the Hearing Panel finds that the CD-locator service operated by Sun Cities Financial had no independent business purpose. It was a marketing tool to lure people into the ofTice, where they might buy other financial products, including, in the case of the Sun City office, securities offered through KCD. The Hearing Panel further finds that the operation of the CD-locator service was integrated with all the businesses operated at the Sun City office, including the securities business, and that KCD understood that the CD-locator service was connected to potential securities transactions, ifnot at the time a customer responded to a CD advertisement then later, when a CD originally purchased in response to the advertising matured.\nTo the extent that the CD advertisements led to securities transactions, KCD also made money and thereby benefited.67\nC. The Sale Of Unregistered Securities\n(1) KCD's Sales Of Private Placement Offerings In Dallas KCD was the broker-dealer through which a Dallas, Texas real estate investment enterprise called Realty Capital Partners (''RCP\") offered and sold interests in real estate development projects. RCP put together real estate investments and employed a sales team of registered representatives to sell interests in those investments. The investments were done as unregistered offerings pursuant to SEC Rule 506 of Regulation D. In late 2010, pursuant to ajoint venture with another entity, RCP employees went to work for the joint venture, which was called Westmount Realty Finance (\"WRF\"). The KCD broker-dealer business was done under the same name as the joint venture, WRF. Isaac Gregory, senior vice president of capital markets at WRF, was responsible for overseeing the registered salespeople affiliated with KCD, first at RCP and then at WRF. He testified that while he was 68 with RCP he was involved in 30 to 40 unregistered offerings representing about $150 million in private equity. 69 Gregory testified that the salespeople were a \"captive\" salesforce who did no business other than for RCP (and then WRF). He said that KCD had no experience with such a \"captive\" 66 RX-52.

Then RCP (later WRF) would handle the preparation ofthe sales documents and put together a package to submit to KCD. KCD would then review the material and sign off on a soliciting dealer agreement. That would be the broker-dealer approval required before launching the 71 offering. As investors subscribed to the offering, Gregory would review the documents and send them to KCD for approval and verification that the investors were accredited investors eligible to participate. 72 Gregory testified that he was familiar with SEC Rule 506, Regulation D, and the form required to be filed when using a Rule 506 exemption from registration. He said that a solicitation to the general public could not be made and that only accredited investors (and/or a maximum of 35 unaccredited investors) could be permitted as investors. 73\n(2) WRF Fund Private Placement After the joint venture was set up and the salesforce transferred to WRF, Westmount Realty put together a private placement for an investment fund known as the WRF Dislressed Residential Fund 2011, LLC (\"WRF Fund\"). The Private Placement Memorandum (PPM\") for the offering disclosed that the WRF Fund would be managed by Westmount Realty Finance LLC (\"Westmount Finance\"), through an affiliate. Westmount Finance was the sponsor for the WRF Fund.74 KCD's CCO at the time, JeffLarson, approved the deal by Signing the soliciting dealer agreement on March 15, 2011, andwithin two to threebusiness days the salesforce began 75 contacting their existing customer base about it. They sold interests quickly thereafter. 76 The soliciting dealer agreement and the PPM for the WRF Fund private placement specified that up to $10 million ofsecurities would be sold.77 KCD, as the selling broker-dealer 70 Hearing Tr.

KCD was also entitled to a share of the Carried Interest distributions payable to the manager of the offering. 78\n(3) The News Articles Raising General Solicitation Issue\nIn late April 2011, the securities attorney who had worked on the PPM for the WRF Fund offering called Gregory with concerns about a newspaper article the attorney had seen in the Dallas Business Journal. The attorney was concerned about the effect ofthe article on the representation in the PPM that the securities were sold pursuant to the Regulation D exemption from registration. 79 The article was one oftwo articles that appeared in local Dallas newspapers. Each article discussed the launch ofthe WRF Fund and quoted Westmount Realty's Chief Investment Officer as saying that'? [W]e continue to see a steady stream ofbuying opportunities.\nThe articles ,,80 used information supplied in a press release Westmount Realty had issued.81\nBased on the securities attorney's reaction to the news article, Gregory believed that the article was a breach of the rules against general solicitation for a private placement. Gregory then called Larson, the KCD CCO, and told him there had been a breach ofthe rules. 82 The Hearing Panel finds it highly significant that KCD was informed that the securities attorney who had worked on the PPM for the WRF Fund offering thought there had been a breach of the rules. The attorney was knowledgeable and familiar with the particular offering.\nHis concerns were not idle speculation.\nThe Hearing Panel also finds it significant that there was no testimony to indicate that Gregory or anyone at KCD called the securities attorney or any other attorney to ask for advice on how to deal with the problem. By avoiding speaking to legal counsel, they avoided being told to stop offering and selling the securities.\nInstead, without benefit of legal counsel, Gregory and Larson developed their own plan and implemented it. They informed the salesforce that the WRF Fund could only be sold to investors who had invested with them before, and not to anyone who had learned ofthe offering through one ofthe news articles. Salespeople were to ask a caller who had not previously 78 JX-27, at 1. 79 Hearing Tr. (499)(500)(501)(502)(503) JX-12; JX-13; Hearing Tr. geh) 249-52; Hearing Tr. (Gregory) 491-508.\n?' Hearing Tr.

If the caller said through the news article, then the salesperson was to decline to allow the caller to invest.\n83 Later, Gregory learned that one ofthe news articles also had been posted on the website for the WRF affiliates, including the KCD broker-dealer business. He called technology staff' and asked them to take it down. He knew that the securities attorney had been especially concerned that the article should not appear on the website. 84 Still later, Gregory learned that, despite his instruction, the article had remained posted on the WRF website until itwas discovered by FINRA staffin October 2011, approximately six months after he instructed that it be taken down. At least one person called a registered 85 representative at WRF expressing an interest in the offering as a result of seeing one of the news 86 articles. Gregory notified KCD of this incident. 87 (4) F?NRA Staff Discovery Of Unregistered Securities Sales In the cycle examination commenced in October 2011, FINRA staff examined the efficacy ofKCD's due diligence in connection with its top three selling private placement offerings. The staff investigated the information publicly available that might not be in the PPMs and compared that information to KCD's files.\nThe WRF Fund offering was one ofthe three top selling private placements the staff examined. The staff discovered the news articles relating to the WRF Fund offering. The article was still posted on the WRF website. KCD's then-CCO, Lori Rastall, instructed Gregory to take the article down from the website. He believed that she had concluded it was a general solicitation, and she testified at her OTR that she thought it was a general solicitation. 88 However, she did not instruct that KCD representatives stop offering and selling the securities. Nor did she do any other follow-up.89 This was the first time that she had dealt with any private placement offerings or exemptions from registration under Regulation D as a CCO. 90 The Hearing Panel finds that neither Gregory nor Rastall did anything meaningful to remove the news article from the WRF website, even though both were aware that the posting on the website was a general solicitation that made it improper for KCD's registered representatives to continue offering the unregistered securities. The problematic news article remained posted on the WRF website for months.\nIV.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "A.

The Panel concludes that, in the circumstances ofthis case, the CD advertisements did constitute the Firm's communications with the public.\nFirs4 the essential purpose of the CD-finder service and advertisements was not to promote CDs but to promote the registered representatives' other businesses, including the sale of securities through KCD.95 The CD-finder service was not actually a sustainable, independent outside business activity. Rather, it was a marketing tool that the representatives in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida and Sun City, Arizona used to promote their actual income-producing businesses-including sales of securities through KCD. Moreover, there was no evidence that the Florida and Arizona offices advertised their securities business, so their securities business depended upon the customer base developed from the CD advertising.\nSecond, from the perspective of the customers who inquired about the CDs, the CD-finder service was intertwined with the securities business through KCD: the CD advertisements were run under the same business name as the securities business; when customers responded to the CD advertisements, they called the same telephone number used for the securities business; and customers met the registered representatives at the same offices from which the representatives conducted their securities business.\nThird, many ofthe people who purchased CDs also actually purchased securities. To the extent that they did, KCD benefited tom the CD advertising. At least with respect to the Arizona office, the benefit must have been substantial, since it was one ofthe Firm's highestproducing offices.\nFourth, KCD was aware of the connection between the CD advertising and potential securities transactions and discussed it in correspondence with Katz and with FINRA staff.\n93 Id. at *13. 94 Hearing Tr.

The news articles constituted a general solicitation, and at least one person understood it as a solicitation and made an inquiry as a result ofseeing one ofthe articles.\nFurthermore, KCD was informed that the securities attorney who worked on the offering documents thought that the news articles had created a breach of the applicable requirements. That was more than a red flag; it was a red stop sign. But KCD ignored the stop sign, and continued to offer and sell securities in the WRF Fund offering. KCD's cure for the violation ofthe registration requirements also had no reasonable basis. There is no safe harbor in the statute or Regulation D for sales of unregistered non-exempt securities to pre-existing customers after a general solicitation has been made. KCD had no authority for its continued offer and sale of the unregistered securities in the face of the clear requirement that it stop.\nThe violation of the registration requirements is serious. \"The registration requirements are the heart of' the Securities Act. Their purpose is to \"protect investors by promoting full 104 disclosure of information thought necessary to informed investment decisions. ,,105 Section 5 imposes strict liability on those who offer or sell unregistered securities.\nScienter (intent to 106 deceive) is not a requirement. 107 NASD Rule 3010, as it was in effect at the time ofthe misconduct, required KCD to establish, maintain, and implement a system of supervision that was reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations.

The representatives purposefully 116 created the false and misleading advertisements and used them to support their securities business. Although the Finn knew the connection between the advertising and the representatives' securities business through KCD,117 and although the Firm benefited from the advertising to the extent that the representatives conducted securities transactions for customers who initially inquired about CDs,118 the Firm treated the advertising as though it had no responsibility for it. It abdicated its responsibility for oversight, and it did so in connection with two different offices in different parts of the country. As a result, the false and misleading advertisements were permitted to circulate repeatedly, each week, for more than three years, from January 2009 to April 2012.119 The Firm has never accepted its responsibility for this misconduct but has suggested, instead, that FINRA staff previously approved the way it handled the CD-finder service as an outside business activity.\nIn these circumstances, the violation 120 cannot be characterized as inadvertent or isolated or aberrant. 121 These are all aggravating circumstances.\nThere are no mitigating circumstances. The Hearing Panel has noted, however, that the lack of continuity in management contributed to its misunderstanding of its obligations. While this is not mitigating, that lack of continuity and accompanying turmoil bear on the likelihood of future misconduct under current management. The Hearing Panel does not presume that going forward under current management the Firm will likely engage in similar misconduct.\nThe Hearing Panel censures the Firm and imposes a total fine of $40,000 for the advertising violation.

One ofthem is ofparamount importance here: whether the respondent disregarded '?red flags\" suggesting the presence of an unregistered distribution. 123 In this case, KCD disregarded a red flag that could not be ignored. The call from the securities attorney who worked on the WRF Fund offering expressing concern about the news article notified KCD ofthe general solicitation and of the loss ofthe exemption from registration.\nKCD's response-to continue offering and selling the securities--was not an 124 appropriate response. The Firm's attempt to cure the violation by selling only to pre-existing customers did not cure the violation. KCD's misconduct was an egregious violation.\nAdditional Principal Considerations applicable in connection with all cases confirm that stringent sanctions are warranted. The misconduct was the result of an intentional act. Gregory and the then-CCO, Larson developed a plan for continuing to offer and sell the unregistered securities even though they knew that the rules regarding the basis for claimed exemption had been breached.125 The Firm failed to develop and implement controls related to the misconduct and did not even make certain that the news article posted on the WRF website was removed. 126 The misconduct resulted in monetary gain to the Firm. 127 Even though the violation was egregious, the Hearing Panel does not impose a suspension. The Panel believes that the remedial purposes of disciplinary sanctions can be served by censuring the Firm and imposing a substantial fine of $75,000. The Hearing Panel chooses a figure that slightly exceeds the top end ofthe Sanction Guideline range even though KCD's violation was egregious and could warrant an even greater sanction.

As a result. the Firm lailed to have adequate systems and procedures in place ?o supervise cenain aspects of its business, including ?lie sales ol'particular complex products. and the review of trades and delivery of trade confirmations.\nFor example, LPL Failed to reasonably supervise ils sales ofconiplex non-traditional exchan?e traded funds ( 'ETFs ). The Firm failed to monitor the length of' time these securities were held in customer accounts. permitted llie breach ol ?l?e Firm's allocation limits, I'ailed to deliver prospecluses to customers buying tliese securities, and permitted sales by certain representalivcs who had not taken the mandatory Firm-developed training on the risks oflhese products.

The Firm used a surveillance sys?cm. which, due to technical Ilaws, failed to generale alerts for certain high-risk activity including low priced equity transactions. actively traded accounts, asset movements and potential employee front-running. The Firm used a separate, but Ihulty, automated system to review its trade blotter, but this system failed to display trading activity past due ?or supervisory review.

LPL failed to reasonably supervise sales of these complex securities in several respects.\nFor example. from April 2010 through April 20 1 5, the Firm 1-ailed to review the length of time its customers held certain of these securities. Certain of LPL's customers held these securities for more than a year, despite the risks associated witll such lengthy holding periods. The Firm s written supervisory procedures required its representatives to monitor non-traditional ETFs held in customer accounts on a daily basis.

However, during ll,is time period. the Firm did not have a supervisory system in place ?o monitor holding periods 1'or non-traditional ETFs in customer accounts.\nAdditionally.

The Firm did not follow these procedures.\nFinally. LPL failed lo ensure tl,at certain rcgistcred representatives were adequately trained to sell non-traditional ETFs. LPL s procedures required its representatives to complete an ETF training course before purchasing or holding non-tmdi?ional ETFs in customer accounts.

The ORT trade blotter, however, only displayed len trades per screen and did nol allow for user Iiltering by price or other parameters.

However, due to coding errors in the Surveillance Syslern, beginning on March 28,2014 that were undetec?ed for approximately six weeks, the two AML scenarios were not operating properly. such that no alerts were generated based on these scenarios.\nThereafter, the Firm was unable lo Correct the coding promptly.

Moreover. a programming ilaw in Portiolio Review Tool permitted registered representatives to delete immediately the consolidated reports tl?ey created wilh tliai system 1'rom LPL's computers. along with the data the representatives used io create the reports. Consequently. LPL is not able 10 detennine which of its registered representatives generated consolidated reports using Firm-provided systems or whether customers received inaccurate or misleading consolidated reports.\nLPL also is not able to identity its registered representatives who generated consolidated reports using systems from third-party providers. Since at least 2009, LPL has permitted its registered representatives to purcliasc licenses directly from vendors I'or access to systems that create consolidated reports, Because lhe Firm's registered representatives contract directly with thirdparty vendors, LPL is not ablc to identify with certainty all ofthe systems that its representatives use to create consolidated reports or the number ofconsolidated reports ll?ose representativcs generated. Moreover, LPL does not know whether some ol' those third-party providers allow the Firm s registered representatives ?o manually enter asset values in consolidated reports, or whether thc third-party providers store confidential customer information on their systems.\nSimilarly, the Firm is not able ?0 identify all of its registered representatives whom it believes generated consolidated reports using soliware such as Excel. Word, and similar producls.\nSince at least 2010, the Firm has reviewed its policies and procedures governing the use and supervision ofconsolidated reports and considered revising its supervisory procedures ?o limit its registered representatives' use of third-party systems for consolidated reports and to prohibit their creation of consolidated reports using software such as Excel and Word. The Firm, however, did not begin to modify ils supervisory procedures until November 2014.\nBy iailing 10 reasonably supervise the use orconsolidated reports by its registered representatives. LPL violated NASD Rules 3010(a) and (b) and FINRA Rule 2010. By failing to retain some ofthe consolidated reports. LPL also violated Section 17 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 1 7a-4 thereunder; NASD Rules 3 1 I O and 30 1 0(d)(3); and FINRA Rules 451 1 and 2010.\n.2.\nLPL Fciilc?l ?c) Rcc,s(),icibly Si?pcn,ise Rc,dic, S?i?,ws Brc,?,?lccist By T\\\\'t) Represe,???iti\\'es a,??l t?, Reviei\\' Other Adr?,-tisi,tg ktate, icils\nIn june 2011, LPL executed an AWC consenting to findings that it failed to supervise two representatives in a Calil'ornia branch office. For five years. irom March 2005 through March 2010, the two representatives aired approximately 520 live, call-in radio sl,ows on 'Radio iran, an AM radio station in Cali?bmia. Tlie representatives broadcast their program in Farsi. Over dial live-year period, LPL failed to request or review any translated copies ofthe representatives broadcasts. FINRA censured LPL and fined it $25,000. At that time, the Firm informed FINRA that il had changed ils inlernal processes in response to its -administrativc oversight ' in ihiling to supervise the representatives broadcasts.\nDespite the findings in tlie AWC and its undertaking to remedy its deficient supervision ol' ?liesi brokers' radio broadcasts, the Firm failed to adequately supervise the radio shows l'or an additional two years. From July 201 1 tl,rough July 2012, thc two rcpresenlatives continued to ho St lheir radio show about four times eacl? ?non?l? on Radio Iran. During their broadc?,sts. the two representatives promoted products through unwarranted and misleading claims, and made numerous assertions tliat violated FINRA s advertising rules. LPL reviewed transcripts of tour of the 44 sliows tl?al the representatives broadcast but not until approximately seven to ten months after each oflhc shows aired. LPL s review ofthe transcripts was therefore ineflcctive. For example, LPL's review of transcripts from shows that were broadcast in December 201 I and I3 February 2()12 highlighted -deficiencies ... which must be addressed immediately.\" but the Firm did not provide those comments to the representatives until many months later, by which time they had broadcast at least 20 more shows.\nAdditionally. the Firm failed ?o supervise advertising malerials used by other representatives. For example, during the period July 201 1 through June 2012, LPL approved at least 17 advertisements for use by its representatives tliat violated FlNRA's advertising rules. Some oi those advertisements, moreover, included misleading claims or omitted material information about the risks olthe investments discussed in the advertisements. In one instance. LPL approved an advertisement for a seminar presentation to retired individuals, but the advertisement incorporated Outdated market data and misleadingly characterized certain investments as having ?no risk?' LPL also filed 16 public communications with FINRA more than 10 days after the Firm's representatives first used tliem.\nBy failing lo reasonably supervise lhe two representatives radio programs, LPL violated NASD Rule 3010(a) and FINRA Rule 2010. Additionally. by railing to reasonably supervise advertising materials used by other representatives, LPL violated NASD Rules 2210(d)( 1)(A), 2210(d)( I )(B), 2210(c)(2). 3010(a). and FINR.A Rule 2010.\n3. LPL Fililkd ic, Rlriew Wrilie,? C msmmcleilce ili ci Til,iely Mil,ilier LPL failed ?o reasonably supervise certain ol its representatives' business-related correspondence. During tlie period April 2010 through July 201 1, ?lie Firm's OSJ located in San Diego, California, failed timely to review correspondence from the branch offices and representatives that il supervised, contrary to LPL's procedures. The San Diego OSj was responsible for supervising a signi ficant number oithe Firm's registered representatives. The OSJ did not review most of that correspondence until FINRA announced that it would conduct an on-site examination ol the office. Of tile 391 pieces ol correspondence that ?l?e OSJ reviewed during thai period. 213 pieces were approved by a regis?ered principal and datcd on tlie business day before FINRA began anon-site examination at the OSJ. Anoll,er 67 pieces ot' correspondence bore a registered principal s initiais, but were not dated.\nBy failing timely to review business-related written correspondence, LPL violated NASD Rule 3010(a) and (b) and FINRA Rule 2010.\n4.

LPL failed Io track and monitor non-solicitation letters for low priced securities. The Firms procedures required that its registered representativcs obtain, and maintain in tlie branch office. a letter of non-solicitation signed by the client for eacl, unsolicited trade involving a low priced security. LPL. however, failed to implement adequate supervisory controls to ensure that these procedures were followed. Nonsolicitation letters were not maintained electronically, thus the Firm's designated principals and home office supervisory principals could not readily determine ifthe required letters had been obtained by the registered representatives whom they supervised.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "I4", "text": "By fhiling ?o implement and maintain an adequate system to review non-solicitation letters, LPL violated NASD Rules 3010(b) and 21 IO and FlNRA Rule 2010.\nF. LPL Failed to Comply witl, Certain Registration Requirements The Firm failed to verify prior employment of certain ol its registered representatives when they registered with the Firm. For example. irom July 20l l ll,rough June 2012, approximately 3.300 registered representatives became associated with LPL. During that period, LPL failed to verify the prior employment of approximately I.782 of those representatives when ?l?ey registered willi lhe Finn, in violation ol' FINRA and MSRB rules. Additionally, from approrimately April 2013 until October 20 I 3, LPL failed lo enforce its procedures. which required the Firm to rc-verify tlie registration status and financial information of -candidates\" whose registration through LPL was still pending 90 days after they submitted their applications.\nAdditionally. from July 201 1 through at least December 2012. LPL failed to make timely filings of Form U4 amendments and Forms U5. For example. in at least 34 instances during the oneyear period between July 2011 and June 2012. LPL failed timely to amend its representatives Forms U4. In 33 of those instances, LPL filed amendments 10 its representatives' Forms U4 between 31 and 179 days after the Firm learned oleven?s triggering its obligation to file the amendments. In IO of those instances, LPL failed to amend its represenlatives Forms U4 until FINRA Staff notified the Firm that it had not made the required filings. From October 2012 through December 2012, LPL similarly failed to file 54 amendments?o its representatives Forms U4 in timely fashion.\nAdditionally, during the one-year period between July 201 1 and June 2012, LPL failed timely to file or amend 18 Forms U5 alter it terminated those representatives' registrations with the Firm, and therefore failed timely to disclose customer complaints against the representatives or the results ol LPL's internal reviews.\nBy lailing to establish and enforce supcrvisory procedures reasonably designed to verify certain registered representatives' prior employment, LPL violated NASD Rule 3010(a) and ?b), F?NRA Rule 2010, and MSRB Rules G-7 and G-27. By failing timely to lile Form U4 amendments and Forms U5. LPL violated FINRA Rules 1 122 and 2010, and Article V, Sections 2 and 3 ofthe FINRA By-laws.\nG. LPL Failed ?o Comply with Rule 204 of Regulation SHO Rule 204 of Regulation SHO requires a firm that has a fail-to-deliver position at a registered clearing agency in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security to close out its fail-10-deliver position by borrowing or purchasing securities of like kind or quality. LPL did not comply with this requirement. From November 30,20 l l to April 9.2()12, the Firm. on 17 occasions, had a fhil ?0 deliver position at a registered clearing agency in an equity security resulting from a long sale trade. LPL. however, did not close-out ?hc position by purchasing or borrowing securities ol like kind and quantity within the time t'rame and manner required by Rule 204(a)( I ) of Regulation SHO.\nAdditionally, the Firm failed to establish and maintain wriuen supervisory procedures reasonably designed to achicve compliance with Rule 204 of Regulation SHO. In particular, the Firm-s procedures did not provide for ( l) identification of persons responsible for supervision: (2) supervisory steps to be taken by tile persons idenulicd: (3) when such supen'isory steps were to be undertaken: and (4) how such supervisory steps were to be documented.\nBased on the foregoing.

In certain circumstances, the customer would face a substantial risk ofloss ofprincipal upon tennination ofthe STRATS due to the amount of the swap termination fee.

Beck failed to apply sales charge discounts to eligible purchases ofunit investment trusts (''UITs\") and failed to establish a supervisory system and written supervisory procedures (\"WSPs\") reasonably designed to ensure lhat customers received sales charge discounts on all eligible UIT purchases. Second, i i. Beck failed to establish a Teasonable supervisory system and WSPs regarding the use of consolidated reports. In addition, certain UIT sponsors offer investors a variety of ways to reduce the sales charge fees charged on a purchase. For example, UIT sponsors often ofTcr salcs charge discounls on UlT purchases that arc funded using redemption or termination proceeds from another UlT during the initial offering period.\nOn March 31,2004, FlNRA issued Notice lo Members 04-26, Un# h?u,?m,en, Trli.W Sa/es, reminding broker-dealers that they should develop and implement procedures to ensure customers receive appropriate sales charge discounts for UITs. The Notice further stated that UIT transactions must take place \"on the most advantageous terms available to the customer\" and that it is the firm's responsibilily to \"cnsurc that they and their employees understand, inform customers about, and apply correctly any applicable price breaks available to customers in connection with UITs.\" During lhe same period, 11. Beck failed to establish, maintain and enforce a supervisory system and WSPs reasonably designed to cnsure customers received sales charge discounts on all eligible UIT purchases. The Firm relicd primarily on its registered rcpresentalives to ensure tha? customers received available UIT sales charge discounts, but failed to appropriately inform and train representatives and their supervisors ?o identify and apply such sales charge discounts. Based on the foregoing, H, Beck violatcd NASD Conduct Rules 3010(a) and (b) and 21 10 and FINRA Rule 2010.\n2. H. Bcck Failed to Reasonably Supervise R??istcrcd Rcr?rcscntativcs' Use of Con,olidalcd Rcnorts A consolidated report is a document provided ?o customers ?hat combines information regarding most or all ofa customer's financial holdings, regardless of where those assets are held, Consolidated reports supplement, but do not replace, customer account statements required pursuant to NASD Conduct Rule 2340.\nin April 2010, FINRA issued Regulatory Notice 10-19, which reminded member firms thal consolidated reports represent communications with the public and must therefore be clear, accurate and not misleading. The Notice directed that firms lhat allow rcpresenlatives to creatc consolidated reports must supervise the activity. For instance, where the consolidated reports include assets held away from the firm, the firm must ensure ?hat rcgis?cred represcntalives ?ake rcasonablc steps to ensure that such assets arc valued accurately.\nFrom July 26,201 1 through May 13,2012, approximately 47 H. Beck registered representatives disseminated consolidated reports to customers. During lh?t same period, H. Bcck had no supcrvisory procedures specifically addressing lhe use and supervision of consolidated reports; therefore, H. Beck did not adequately address matters ofconcem specific to consolidated reports, such as the verification of valua?ion information providcd or ensuring that registered representatives retain supporting documentation for such valuations. Based on the foregoing, H. Beck vio?ated NASD Conduct Rules 3010(a) and (b) and 2110 and FTNRA Rule 2010.\nAlso, a rcvicw of consolidated rcports issued by H. Bcck representatives from July 26,2011 through May 13,2012 disclosed instances in which represenlatives sent consolidated reports to customers ?hat were inaccumle, primarily becausc the representatives manually inpu?ted valuations ofccrtain illiquid investments. Based on the foregoing, H, Beck violated NASD  11. Beck's WSPs required lhat non-registered employees utilize an cmail address for business-relatcd communications that is rcgistcrcd with the Firm's outside vendor so thai the emails could be archived.

From December 2000 through November 2007, he was separately employed by two other FINRA member firms in registered and non-registered capacities. Goswami became registered with BNP Paribas Securities Corp. (\"BNP\" or the \"Firm\") in May 2008 and worked in the Firm's Fund Solutions Group, which provided a range of services to hedge funds and other alternative investment managers. He remained at BNP until October 16, 2012, when he was terminated for engaging in an undisclosed outside business activity. Goswami held Series 7 and 63 licenses.\nAlthough Goswami is not currently employed in the securities industry, he remains subject to F?NRA's jurisdiction pursuant to FINRA By-Law Article V, Section 4 until at least November 12, 2014.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "RELEVANT DISCIPLINARY HISTORY", "text": "Goswami does not have any relevant disciplinary history.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "OVERVIEW", "text": "During the period May 2011 through October 2012, while registered with the Firm, Goswami engaged in a business activity outside the scope of his relationship with the Firm. Goswami failed to provide prior written notice to the Firm before engaging in this business activity, in violation of FINRA Rules 3270 and 2010.\nGoswami also violated NASD Rules 2210 and 2211 and FINRA Rule 2010 by sending emails and sales material to potential institutional investors, which contained false, misleading and unwarranted statements concerning the outside business activity and his and the Firm's involvement in that business.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "FACTS AND VIOLATIVE CONDUCT", "text": "1.

Specifically, Goswami acted as an advisor to DIG, arranged introductions for DIG with service providers (e.g. law and accounting firms) and institutional investors, reviewed and provided comments on DIG's marketing materials and distributed those marketing materials to the potential institutional investors. Goswami held himself out to some third parties as one of the founders of DIG and represented that he was heavily involved in its launch. Goswami did not receive any c6mpensation from DIG and there is no evidence that any of the potential institutional investors invested in DIG. DIG offered to pay Goswami for the introductions to investors and service providers. Goswami's involvement with and assistance to DIG was outside the scope of his responsibilities at the Firm. Goswami did not provide the Firm with prior written notice before engaging in an undisclosed outside business activity with DIG. Further, Goswami did not disclose his involvement with DIG on his 201 1 annual compliance certification.\nBy engaging in an undisclosed outside business activity with DIG without providing prior written notice to the Firm, Goswami violated FINRA Rules 3270 and 2010. Goswami sent emails regarding DIG from his Firm email account to at least six institutional investors. Some of these emails contained a signature block that referenced the Firm. Goswami did not disclose in the emails the relationship or lack ofrelationship of the Firm with DIG, which created the misleading impression that DIG was associated with the Firm. In these emails, Goswami also exaggerated his role in DIG and referred to DIG's Private Placement Memorandum, when, in fact, that document did not exist.\nGoswami also distributed DIG sales material to potential institutional investors that contained statements concerning the investment strategy and returns of a prior fund managed by one of DIG's founders, which created the impression that DIG would be successful and achieve similar returns. These statements were exaggerated and unwarranted as there could be no assurance that a DIG investment would be successful or deliver similar investment returns.\nBy sending emails and sales materials that contained false, misleading and unwarranted statements, Goswami violated NASD Rules 2210(d)(1)(A) and NASD Rule 2211(d)(1) and FINRA Rule 2010.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "B.", "text": "I also consent to the imposition ofthe following sanctions:\nL A 60-day suspension from association with any FINRA member in any capacity and a $7,500 fine.\nThe fine shall be due and payable either immediately upon reassociation with a member firm following the 60-day suspension noted above, or prior to any application or request for relieffrom any statutory disqualification resulting from this or any other event or proceeding, whichever is earlier.\nI specifically and voluntarily waive any right to claim that I am unable to pay, now or at any time hereafter, the monetary sanction imposed in this matter.\nBy failing to return investor funds and, instead, releasing the funds to the issuer of OEM 0101 and by continuing to offer and sell units in OEM 01 01 when the Minimum had not been raised and the termination date had passed, Key West rendered the PPM's representations to be false and misleading and thereby willfully violated Exchange Act Section 10(b), Rule l Ob-9 thereunder, and FINRA Rule 2010.\n2.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "The Escrow Violation", "text": "Exchange Act Rule 15c2-4 provides that funds raised in a contingency offering be promptly transmitted to a bank, independent of the issuer, that has agreed to hold those funds in escrow and to either forward them to the issuer or return them to investors upon the satisfaction or failure ofthe contingency.

(\"Arque\") has been a registered broker-dealer since July 2002, and is also currently registered as an investment adviser. GWG Holdings, Inc. purchases life insurance policies on the secondary market at a discount to the face value ofthe policies. Once GWG purchases apolicy, itpays the policy premiums until the insured dies. GWG then collects the face value ofthe insurance benefit. GWG hopes to eam returns by collecting more upon the maturity ofthe policies than it has paid to purchase, finance and service the policies. The company has a limited operating history and has not yet obtained profits through its strategy. GWG has purchased almost all of the policies it owns with funds borrowed from financial institutions or investors.\nIn 2012, GWG began selling what it called Renewable Secured Debentures. The minimum investment in the Debentures is $25,000. Additional investments can be made in $1,000 increments. The Debentures have varying maturity terms and interest rates, from six-month Debentures ofTering an annual interest rate 4.75% to seven-year Debentures offering 9.50%.\nThe prospectus forthe Debentures states that the life insurance policies held by GWG are not collatcral for obligations under the Debentures. Instead, those policies have been separately pledged as collateral for a line ofcredit used by GWG to purchase life insurance policies. As statedintheprospectus, the Debentures maybe considered speculative investments and involve ahigh degree ofrisk, including the risk ofloss ofthe entire investment. The prospectus states that the company's success is dependent upon, among otherthings, its continued ability toraise funds to pay itsobligations, including interest payments undertheDebentures.\nAn investment in the Debentures is also illiquid. Investors do not have to access their principal prior to maturity unless the request is due to death, banlmiptcy or total disability.\nIf GWG decides to prepay the Debentures other than under those circumstances, a prepayment fee of 6% may be charged. There is also no trading market for the Debentures.\nFor these reasons, as the prospectus states, an investment in the Debentures is not suitable for investors who need liquidity prior to the Debenture's maturity date.\nArque Distributed Misleading GWG Sales Material\nBetween March 2012 and November 2012, Arque distributed a GWG Debenture sales brochure to certain investors (\"GWG Brochure\"). The GWG Brochure, which was created by GWG and included in its sales kit, along with the prospectus, stated that 'Renewable Secured Debentures are secured by the corporate assets of GWG, which consist primarily of investments in life insurance policies purchased in the secondary market.\" The GWG Brochure further stated that the Debentures '?are secured by all the corporate assets of GWG. GWG's assets consist primarily ofthe life insurance policies purchased in the secondary market and are summarized in the table below.\" The table stated that GWG held over $489 million of life insurance policies.\nHowever, the $489 million value was the face value ofthe policies and not their current value, a signi?cantly lower number. Moreover, as stated in the prospectus for the Debentures, the life insurance poHcies were not collateral for the Debentures and instead had been pledged as collateral for a separate line ofcredit used by GWG to purchase life insurance policies and finance its operations. Any \"secured\" interest the Debentures have in the assets of GWG is thus subordinate to other significant interests of creditors.\nAlthough the correct information was contained in the prospectus that was also delivered to the investors, it had not been accurately reflected in the GWG Brochure in March 2012. In November 2012, the inconsistencies between the GWG Brochure and the prospectus were discovered and the GWG Brochure was promptly changed.\nBetween March 2012 and November 2012, Arque sold atotal ofapproximately $3.53 million of Debentures to approximately 40 investors while providing investors the GWG sales kit containing the misleading brochure. Moreover, as the managing broker-dealer for the offering ofthe Debentures, Arque had an obligation to, but did not, review the brochure and take reasonable steps to ensure that there was a reasonable basis for the statements made in the brochure.\nBy distributing sales literature which contained misleading statements, omitted material facts, and failed to provide a sound basis for evaluating the securities that were being offered, as described above, Arque violatedNASD Rule 2210(d)0)(A).
