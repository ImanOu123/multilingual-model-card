In particular, theory of mind plays an important role in maintaining common ground during human collaboration and communication. To enable theory of mind modeling in situated interactions, we introduce a fine-grained dataset of collaborative tasks performed by pairs of human subjects in the 3D virtual blocks world of Minecraft. It provides information that captures partners' beliefs of the world and of each other as an interaction unfolds, bringing abundant opportunities to study human collaborative behaviors in situated language communication. As a first step towards our goal of developing embodied AI agents able to infer belief states of collaborative partners in situ, we build and present results on computational models for several theory of mind tasks. * Equal Contribution. \u2020 Work performed while the author was an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Michigan.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Creating embodied, situated agents able to move in, communicate naturally about, and collaborate on human terms in the physical world has been a persisting goal in artificial intelligence (Winograd, 1972). During communication in such a setting, agents not only need to ground entities in language to that of the physical world; efficient and accurate human-agent collaboration further requires agents to reason about the progress of the task at hand and to plan and execute a series of collaborative steps, whilst maintaining common ground (Clark, 1996) with collaboration partners, in order to achieve a certain goal.\nDespite recent advances, we are still far away from fully enabling these desired agent behaviors.\nOne key challenge is in an agent's ability to establish and maintain common ground in tandem with human partners, especially in a setting where beliefs about the world and of each other may change on the fly (Popat and Palmer, 2005;Powers et al., 2005). It is important to understand how changes in a dynamic, physical world affect agents' beliefs of each other-i.e., theory of mind (Premack and Woodruff, 1978)-and how such beliefs influence teamwork and communication in collaborative tasks. As a first step to address this question, this paper explores theory of mind modeling (Chandrasekaran et al., 2017;Rabinowitz et al., 2018;Jara-Ettinger, 2019) in situated language communication (Iwahashi et al., 2009;McGuire et al., 2002) for collaborative tasks within the 3D virtual blocks world of Minecraft. Through a novel experimental setup, we collect a situated dialogue dataset that demonstrates how collaborative partners with a set of asymmetric knowledge and skills are able to collaborate to achieve joint goals, and how, in particular, their beliefs of each other evolve and converge over time. Based on this dataset, we further build several baseline computational models to explicitly predict key elements of a collaboration partner's mental state from the viewpoint of an agent as a task unfolds. Our empirical results demonstrate that while language is certainly important in this inference, the shared physical environment and the perceived activities play a greater role in shaping a partner's understanding of each other in order to come to a common ground.\nThe contributions of this work are threefold. First, we introduce MINDCRAFT, a task in which pairs of users collaboratively work to create novel materials by combining blocks in the 3D virtual world of Minecraft, with the ultimate objective of creating a final, goal material. Unlike prior work in situated collaborative tasks (Liu et al., 2013;Bisk et al., 2018;Suhr et al., 2019), a key focus of our work is to facilitate theory of mind modeling-the ability to attribute mental states, both of one's own and that of others-an important but not yet wellstudied topic in situated collaborative interactions. Within designed collaborative tasks, we have users record their beliefs about the state of the game, and of each other, at periodic intervals. Our data captures an evolution of the states of mind of our participants that are true representations of their beliefs-not simply proxies for the true sequence of events in a collaborative session. This explicit modeling of theory of mind sheds light on how partners strive to align their mental models in order to achieve common ground during collaboration.\nSecond, departing from previous Leader-Follower setups (where one partner explicitly leads and gives instructions to the other, the follower, who tries to execute said instructions) (Suhr et al., 2019), we focus on a setting where partners each have asymmetric knowledge (Bortolaso et al., 2019) and skill-sets towards completing a joint goal. In order to effectively complete the given tasks, partners need to negotiate their own plans of action by taking into account what they currently know and don't know about their partner, and of their common understanding of the task at hand. Our novel, more relaxed setup provides support for greater diversity in modes of collaboration that are more representative of that in the real world.\nThird, we introduce a set of baseline computational models to infer fellow player mental states in situ, as a collaborative agent would, and highlight some further challenges present in moving towards building fully realistic agents able to reason about human mental states in situated environments.\nOur platform, data, and models are made available \u2021 and will facilitate future work on physical agents that can effectively collaborate with humans through situated dialogue.", "publication_ref": ["b31", "b7", "b19", "b20", "b21", "b5", "b23", "b12", "b11", "b17", "b16", "b1", "b25", "b25", "b2"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Our work builds upon existing efforts within collaborative dialogue in understanding the nuances of human collaboration and in towards building computational agents that can engage in language communication and collaborative tasks with humans in a physical environment.\nSituated and task-oriented natural language interactions (Iwahashi et al., 2009;Zarrie\u00df et al., 2016) have been studied in a variety of environments, including in custom 2D worlds (Liu et al., 2012;Aizawa, 2020, 2019), in the physical world with human-robot interactions (McGuire et al., 2002;Chai et al., 2014Chai et al., , 2018, and in various 3D virtual worlds (Bisk et al., 2018;Suhr et al., 2019). Most closely, our environment builds upon recent work by Narayan-Chen et al. (2019) and Jayannavar et al. (2020), whereby computational models of user dialogue prediction and user next-action prediction are investigated in the setting of a collaborative dialogue task within the 3D virtual blocks world of Minecraft. However, to our knowledge, none of these previous works explicitly model theory of mind for dialogue agents.\nTheory of mind as a subject, especially in computation (Laird et al., 2017), has gained increased attention in areas including agent-agent reinforcement learning (Rabinowitz et al., 2018), dialogue systems (Qiu et al., 2021), human-computer interaction , agent-agent collaborative dialogue (Roman et al., 2020), and explainable AI (Akula et al., 2021). Worthy of note is the type of mental state recording we employ: specifically, we ask players to record their own mental states during interaction. Unlike prior work that has largely utilized external annotators for post-hoc mental state attribution , we expand on Eicher et al. (2017) and  by specifically bringing user self-reported mental states from that of only the linguistic domain to multimodal situated dialogue.

We are particularly interested in how these agents collaborate and negotiate with each other to come to a shared plan in order to achieve a joint goal. To this end, we explicitly model agents' knowledge and skills in MIND-CRAFT tasks.\nKnowledge. Each player is given a knowledge graph-the recipe-as shown in Figure 1. Recipes given to players specify a joint goal and a partial set of macro-actions needed to take place toward completing the goal. For example, Player A, from the initial recipe, knows how to create Yellow Wool, but they do not know how it would contribute to making the goal material, Emerald Block. On the other hand, Player B, while they do not initially know how to create Yellow Wool, is given the knowledge that doing so would lead to creating Cobblestone, then used to make the goal material.\nSkill-Sets. In order to stack blocks together, agents must be able to physically move blocks around in the virtual environment. This is achieved by hitting blocks with specific tools; randomly generated constraints exist in each game that specify which tools are able to interact with which blocks. Given randomly to agents at the start of each game, these tools effectively set constraints on which agents possess the necessary skills to interact with certain block types.\nCombined, this asymmetry in both knowledge (recipes) and skill-sets (tools) motivates communication, as each individual agent does not (1) know how to create the goal material (2) nor do they have the skill-set to do so on their own. Furthermore, as both agents are situated within the environment, both have only partial observability of the game state, limited by their first-person field of view ingame.

As shown in Figure 1, each player is asked three types of questions:\n\u2022 Completed Task Status. This asks if a specific material has been created, by themselves or by the other player, since the start of the game, probing into the player's beliefs about the current state of the game as influenced by either themselves or their collaboration partner. For example, as shown in Figure 1, Player B is prompted with the question \"Has the other player made Blue Wool until now?\" \u2022 Player Knowledge. This asks if the player knows how to create a specific material, or if they believe that their partner possesses the knowledge to create it. This probes into a player's current knowledge of their own and of their partner's current knowledge, as in-fluenced by the initial knowledge they were provided and that which has been gained, via communication with their partner, since the start of the game. In this example, Player B is given the question \"Do you know how to make Yellow Wool?\" \u2022 Player Current Task. This asks players what they believe they themselves are making, or believe their partner to be making, at current time. For example, Player A is given the question \"What do you think the other player is making right now?\" Question Pairing. The three questions received by players are paired by type; i.e. if one player is asked a question of their own beliefs, the other player is asked the same question on what they believe their partner's beliefs to be. In the example given, when Player B is prompted with the question \"Has the other player made Blue Wool until now?\", at the same time, Player A is prompted with the question \"Have you created Blue Wool?\" The game is paused when players record their answers to the set of questions and resumed when both players have completed their answers.

Pairs of players participated in the experiments through a remote video conference, where they were instructed to access a custom Minecraft server using a game client, as well as a web page interface that we provided, used to display recipe information and to collect player beliefs with periodic popups, once every 75 seconds. Pop-ups ask three questions at once-one of each type-the content of each being paired to the corresponding question asked to the other player. During games, players are only able to communicate with each other using in-game chat, and each pair of players played at most 5 games.\nFrom these games, we log their timestamped dialogue utterances via in-game chat, their questions and answers to the periodic popups for belief recordings, an internal game log that stores the entire game state, and three sets of video record-ings, representing each player's first-person point of view and a third-person point of view at a high vantage point with a clear view of the entire game.\nIn our dataset, there is an average of 20.5 dialogue exchanges per game, for a total of 2091 exchanges. Games last between 1 minute and 22 seconds to 27 minutes and 26 seconds, with the average game lasting 7 minutes and 23 seconds. A total of 12 hours, 18 minutes, and 33 seconds of in-game interaction was recorded. On average, 4 popup question pairs appear each game.

This pilot consists of 32 games to measure key statistics in areas of communication, interaction length, and mutual mental state agreement, with 8 games per configuration. Games were played in sets of four between pairs of players in a round-robin fashion across configurations, mitigating for external factors among pairs such as player game and mutual familiarity.\nAs shown in Table 1, within our expectation, a disparity in both skill-sets and knowledge causes players to disagree and communicate the most to a statistically significant degree, and a disparity in either produces significantly more dialogue utterances than when both are shared. Players in fully disparate games have the lowest agreement in mutual knowledge and task completion. Despite this, in fully disparate games, a higher level of agreement is present for beliefs of the current tasks being performed by either player (e.g., compared to the shared skills configuration), which we attribute to players needing to ask for help more, thus communicating more and being more aware of each other, in such situations.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Evolution of Belief States", "text": "To understand how the interaction discourse shapes partners' beliefs of the tasks and of each other, we take a closer look at three types of beliefs (as reflected by our three types of questions) and examine how they evolve as collaboration and communication unfold. Segmenting individual games into 10% sections across each game's duration, we examine player agreement and disagreement as games progress. Figure 2 shows the aggregated results from all games for our three types of beliefs.\nOn average, player agreement on completed task status remains high and relatively constant throughout a game's progression, averaging around 80 percent, as shown in Figure 2a. However, as each game progresses, there is a noticeable increase in the agreement among two players in terms of what they believe about the other player's knowledge (Figure 2b). Similarly, beliefs about what the other player's current task is also increase notably in agreement as each game progresses, averaging around 12 percent at the start, gradually reaching over 60 percent by the end of the game (Figure 2c).\nThese results demonstrate that the longer the two players collaborate with each other in a game, the more aligned they become in their beliefs about each other. Furthermore, player understanding of completed tasks can be acquired by direct observations from the environment itself, and it's easier to reach an agreement (i.e., joint understanding or common ground) here than an understanding of a partner's mental states.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Dialogue Behavior", "text": "To better understand how agreement or disagreement in players' mutual beliefs affect dialogue behavior, we conduct a further analysis by examining dialogue utterances in a fixed time window of 75 seconds before and after a question is asked for each question type, separating instances of agreement and disagreement. Figure 3 shows the average number of dialogue exchanges across all games in this stratification.\nFor beliefs about the status of a completed task (Figure 3a), we observe no difference in dialogue exchanges before the question is posed between instances of agreement and disagreement in beliefs;  1: Statistics on games with varying skill and knowledge configurations; minimums (min), averages (avg), maximums (max), and standard deviations (std) for the number of dialogue exchanges and durations of each game configuration are shown, as are player agreements for all three question types. interestingly, however, immediately following a given question, a significant difference becomes apparent in the number of dialogue exchanges. When there is agreement between players about the state of tasks, we observe that they, on average, tend to communicate more to continue on the course to further elaborate on their plan.\nOn the other hand, for beliefs of partner knowledge, we do not observe a change in behavior before or after a question is asked (Figure 3b), and, for beliefs that involve a partner's current task (Figure 3c), interesting of note is that the average number of dialogue exchanges leading to disagreement was significantly less than that which led to agreement. This highlights a potential reason why disagreement occurred: less communication. We observe that communication is especially important for players to infer what tasks their partner is currently working on, as it's difficult to know the current goal of a partner by only observing their partial actions without communicating about it, due to their own incomplete plan.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Computational Models for Inferring Belief States", "text": "Based on our dataset, a variety of computational problems can be formulated, developed, and evaluated.

As a first step, we implement a straightforward model that, from a player's perspective, predicts the state of the task as well as the mental states of a partner at any given time based on historical observations of a rich discourse of dialogue and perceived actions in the shared environment.\nFigure 4 shows the overall architecture of our model. Our dataset is comprised of two time-seriesbased modalities: (1) a video stream coming from either player's first-person POV, and (2) dialogue exchanges. We implement a forward sequence-tosequence model, such that inferences at any given time are only able to process inputs that have occurred before it.\nPlan Processing. Recall that each player is provided a partial view of the complete plan. Here, each plan is stored as a list of tuples, representing each material present in the plan, associated with the materials needed to make it and the tool needed to interact with it. Represented naturally as a graph, the list of nodes is given as input to a GRU (Chung et al., 2014) for encoding.

As shown in Figure 5a, we find that the best performing configuration is the Transformer-based model that uses only the video modality. This result seems to suggest that Seeing is believing; in situated communication, as partners are co-present in a shared environment, they can observe each other's activities and the resulting world state after participant actions to reason about completed tasks-collaborators don't need to use language to communicate about what has already been accomplished. Furthermore, as a large time period may exist between sub-tasks that have been completed and their associated belief question prompts, the Transformer-based model with video inputs only is able to significantly outperform LSTM-based models which may be unable to capture such a time dependency.\nInferring Player Beliefs of Partner Knowledge.\nHere, we predict player beliefs of the knowledge possessed by their partners to achieve designated sub-goals, specifically in response to questions such as \"Does the other player know how to make an Emerald Block?\".

We also see an example of slight backtracking happening, where Player 2 realizes that they are further along in the plan than they initially thought.\nIn Figure 7b, we see an example of a fairly straightforward exchange of dialogue. Player 1 notices that they are not aware of the recipe for Soul Sand, which is needed to create the goal material, Emerald Block. They then inquire with their partner about it, who then states that they are unaware, instead, of how to make Black Wool, which is necessary for creating Soul Sand. Once the information is exchanged, the intermediate material is created promptly and both players then proceed to create their goal material.\nConsider the dialogue exchange in Figure 7c. The two players are one step away from creating their goal material, Orange Wool. Player 1 points out that they require a block of Cyan Wool. Player 1 is pointing this out to Player 2 even though they cannot be sure Player 2 shares the knowledge as, in order to interact with the necessary materials, an Iron Shovel, which Player 1 does not possess, is required. From Player 2's perspective, while they are also aware that a block of Cyan Wool is required, they do not know how to make one as the arrows in their plan view are missing. As such, they inquire with their collaboration partner about the recipe. Player 1 then updates Player 2 on how to make Cyan Wool and also points out that one of the materials necessary was already created. This sample extract of their overall interaction is an example of grounding to the visual modality of their dialogue: our dataset provides much longer sequences of such interactions that  are also causally dependant on one another. It is important to note here that the players are not assumed leader or follower roles; in this situation, the two participants coordinated entirely on their own and reached a consensus on who provides information and who is to execute the tasks. These roles switch throughout the game as their disparities in skills and knowledge change. These select dialogue exchanges showcase a small part of the diversity in possible interactions that happen in our experimental setup, whereby players are able to negotiate, decide, and execute their plans of action in a collaborative setting with relaxed constraints on player roles.
