Specifically, these agents must infer personas of their listeners to produce statements that cater to their interests. They must also learn to maintain consistent speaker personas for themselves throughout the narrative, so that their counterparts feel involved in a realistic conversation or story. However, personas are diverse and complex: they entail large quantities of rich interconnected world knowledge that is challenging to robustly represent in general narrative systems (e.g., a singer is good at singing, and may have attended conservatoire). In this work, we construct a new large-scale persona commonsense knowledge graph, PEACOK, containing \u223c100K human-validated persona facts. Our knowledge graph schematizes five dimensions of persona knowledge identified in previous studies of human interactive behaviours, and distils facts in this schema from both existing commonsense knowledge graphs and largescale pretrained language models. Our analysis indicates that PEACOK contains rich and precise world persona inferences that help downstream systems generate more consistent and engaging narratives. 1   ", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Interlocutors or storytellers in narrative scenarios often exhibit varying behaviours, which are affected by their own diverse personas, but also the personas of the counterparts they are interacting with. For example, an adventurous architect may be interested in talking about outdoor explorations with his friends who have similar hobbies, but may prefer to discuss architectural design ideas with his This goal of modeling diverse persona attributes is at the heart of research in the areas of personagrounded dialogue (Zhang et al., 2018;Zhong et al., 2020;Xu et al., 2022), story generation (Chandu et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2022) and narrative understanding (Brahman et al., 2021). However, the complex nature of real-world personas, which involve rich world knowledge, and the countless ways in which they might interact, is challenging to reliably learn purely from data. For instance, as shown in Figure 1, a singer preparing an album may have studied music at university at one point, which would allow them to share their experience with a student majoring in composition, who may study music as a daily routine.\nPrior work takes first steps at improving the persona knowledge representations available in narrative systems. Mazare et al., 2018 extract self-comments from Reddit websites to expand the scale of background persona profiles that can be used in downstream narrative settings. However, their collected profiles are fragmented and ignore the interconnections between personas that govern interactions. Meanwhile, Majumder et al., 2020 use knowledge generators (Bosselut et al., 2019) to expand the persona profiles with commonsense inferences, but these commonsense expansions are limited to general social commonsense (Hwang et al., 2021), and do not form a systematic personacentric knowledge frame. Consequently, the lack of world-level persona commonsense knowledge resource hinders progress in learning the systematic persona representations necessary to sustain consistent and engaging narratives.\nIn this work, we propose a Persona-grounded Commonsense Knowledge graph (KG), PEACOK, which represents world-level persona knowledge at scale. Building off the persona concept initially proposed in human-computer interaction (Cooper, 1999;Mulder and Yaar, 2006;Cooper et al., 2007) and on behaviour analysis literature for human leisure conversations (Dunbar et al., 1997), we define a persona frame that formalizes five common aspects of persona knowledge: characteristics, routines and habits, goals and plans, experiences, and relationships. Using this knowledge frame, we construct a large-scale graph of persona commonsense knowledge by extracting and generating persona knowledge from both existing hand-crafted commonsense KGs and large-scale pretrained language models (LMs). We validate the knowledge graph via a joint human-AI majority voting scheme that integrates large pretrained LMs into the loop of crowdsourcing, and efficiently mediates the disagreements between human annotators.\nOur resulting KG, PEACOK contains \u223c100K high-quality commonsense inferences (i.e., facts) about personas whose connectivity in the KG reveals countless opportunities to discover common ground between personas. A neural extrapolation from the KG (Hwang et al., 2021) also shows that PEACOK's annotated personas enable the development of effective persona inference generators. Finally, the extended knowledge provided by PEA-COK enables a downstream persona-grounded dialogue system to generate more consistent and engaging responses in conversations, particularly when more interconnections between the interlocutor personas are found in PEACOK.", "publication_ref": ["b46", "b48", "b45", "b4", "b47", "b2", "b27", "b1", "b7", "b28", "b8", "b11"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Commonsense Knowledge Graphs Commonsense KGs such as ConceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004;Speer et al., 2017), ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019a), ANION (Jiang et al., 2021) and ATOMIC 20 20 (Hwang et al., 2021) are widely used in NLP applications that involve integrating implicit world knowledge, e.g., question answering (Talmor et al., 2019;Sap et al., 2019b;Chang et al., 2020;Shwartz et al., 2020) and text generation (Lin et al., 2020). However, despite the importance of persona knowledge in modeling human behavior -a crucial component for building reliable narrative systems (Zhang et al., 2018;Chandu et al., 2019) -no commonsense KG explicitly focuses on representing human persona knowledge. We present PEA-COK to open the field of developing commonsense knowledge graphs around personas. Persona-Grounded Narratives Integrating personas to improve consistency and engagement of narratives is an important goal in dialogue (Song et al., 2020; and storytelling (Chandu et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2022) systems. One representative work that greatly contributed to the development of faithful persona emulation, PERSONA-CHAT (Zhang et al., 2018), constructs a crowdsourced dialogue dataset by asking participants to perform conversations based on their assigned persona profiles -five statements of selfintroduction. More recent work improves persona modeling in narrative systems by generating persona profiles from online resources (Mazare et al., 2018), training persona detectors (Gu et al., 2021) and predictors (Zhou et al., 2021), and distilling persona knowledge from commonsense inference engines (Majumder et al., 2020). However, while these works align characters in narratives with persona profiles, they only implicitly model the areas of interaction between personas. In contrast, PEACOK explicitly represents interconnections between persona profiles, enabling persona interaction modeling in narrative systems.", "publication_ref": ["b24", "b42", "b35", "b18", "b44", "b36", "b5", "b39", "b21", "b46", "b4", "b41", "b4", "b47", "b46", "b27", "b13", "b49", "b26"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "PEACOK Knowledge Frame", "text": "To construct a systematic representation of persona knowledge, we distill five common aspects of personas from classical persona definitions.\nIn the field of human-computer interaction, a persona is a fictitious example of a user group that is conceptualized to improve interactive design in areas such as marketing, communications, and service product development (Soegaard and Dam, 2012). From the perspective of goal-directed design (Cooper, 1999;Cooper et al., 2007), personas encapsulate user needs and goals when interacting with a product, along with their intrinsic character traits and past experiences (Randolph, 2004) that contextualize the interaction. Using these attributes of goals, traits, and experiences as the foundation of personas, we also leverage prior studies in human conversational behaviour that explore which topics of conversation are often broached in relaxed human social interactions. After conducting observational studies, Dunbar et al. (1997) categorized the topics of human conversations into bins: personal relationships (i.e., experiences or emotions rising from social interactions), personal experiences (i.e., factual events or circumstances experienced by a person), future activities (i.e., arrangements of meetings or events), leisure activities (e.g., hobbies), interests (e.g., culture, politics, religion), and work (e.g., daily routines).\nTo select our persona dimensions, we discard certain controversial categories from the above studies (i.e., culture, politics, and religion), as well as temporary dimensions of persona (i.e., emotion, which is well covered by prior work; Gupta et al., 2017;Chatterjee et al., 2019;. Our final persona frame consists of five relations for each persona, each with multiple attributes attached to it. We describe the five relations below:\nCharacteristics describe an intrinsic trait, e.g., a quality or a mental state, that the persona likely exhibits. For example, as shown in Figure 1, good at singing describes a talent of a singer, which is one of the singer's characteristics.\nRoutines or Habits describe an extrinsic behaviour that the persona does on a regular basis, e.g., a singer may regularly write songs.\nGoals or Plans describe an extrinsic action or outcome that the persona wants to accomplish or do in the future, e.g., a singer may aim to win a Grammy award some day.\nExperiences describe extrinsic events or activities that the persona did in the past. For instance, a singer may have studied music at college.\nRelationships encode likely interactions of the persona with other people or social groups. Note that this relation can be overlapped with other relations in PEACOK. For example, a singer may want to have more fans, which connotes a relationship between singer and fans, but also a future goal or plan of singer.", "publication_ref": ["b7", "b8", "b32", "b11", "b14", "b6"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "PEACOK Construction", "text": "We use our persona frames to construct a knowledge graph of persona commonsense where personas are treated as head entities in the graph, frame relations constitute edge type relations, and attributes are tails in a (head, relation, tail) structure.

Then we query these KGs and prompt pretrained LMs to collect tail attributes that are potentially associated with the personas via the five relations defined in Sec. 3.

We assume that entities related to personas should be about human beings, rather than other animals or non-living objects. Therefore, we first over-sample living entities from ATOMIC 20 20 which have animated behaviours, by extracting head entities that possess the CapableOf relation (i.e., are capable of doing something), e.g., an actor who is capable of performing, as shown in Figure 2. Then we filter out non-human beings in our extracted living entities, by removing entities that appear in the Animal Appendix of Wiktionary. 2 We also manually filter out other inappropriate entities which are too generic (e.g., man) or unrealistic (e.g., devil).\nThis initial procedure provides us with a diverse collection of initial coarse personas (e.g., actor, singer). To enlarge our persona set with finegrained personas (e.g., actor who acts in movies vs. actor who acts in plays), we collect additional persona candidates using three types of event-based entities derived from our initial persona set: a) entities containing the initial persona in a more complex context, e.g., X becomes an actor associates with the process of becoming an actor, rather than being an actor, b) entities that can be linked to the initial persona through the ATOMIC 20 20 CapableOf relation, e.g., X acts in play is linked to actor, and c) entities that are returned by Sentence-BERT retrieval (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) for the initial persona, e.g., X becomes a movie star. For the latter two types of derived event-based entities, we prompt InstructGPT-3 (Ouyang et al., 2022) to filter out extended personas which do not entail their initial seed persona, e.g., X wants to be a lawyer is not entailed by a X is a judge, as X would already be a lawyer if they were a judge.

Because we observe that a fine-grained labeling schema can help workers better distinguish different relations and yield more precise annotations, we task workers with classifying fine-grained underlying features of the relations. For each attribute, we independently ask two workers to judge whether it describes: a) an intrinsic or extrinsic feature of the persona, b) a one-off or regular attribute of the persona, c) a past, present or future attribute of the persona, d) an attribute of only the persona itself, or describing the persona's relationship with others (interactivity). Finally, for each attribute in the persona frame, we ask workers whether the attribute is distinctively associated with the persona or generically associated with many potential personas (distinctiveness). As an example, in Table 1, we see that get tips from customers is distinctively associated as a common routine of a waiter. Meanwhile, get better is a generic attribute that would not be strongly associated with runner, as many personas can have the goal of self-improvement. We follow Figure 3 to map the first three dimensions of the feature labels to one of the first four relations defined in Sec. 3, which we define as the main relation label of each persona-attribute pair. The other two dimensions of feature labels, i.e., interactivity (containing the fifth relation in Sec. 3) and distinctiveness, are defined as two additional relation labels.

We prompt InstructGPT-3 on three label-  ing tasks corresponding to the three dimensions of relation labeling schema shown in Figure 3. For the main dimension, we set the labeling classes to include the four main relation labels, and also a negative class (No Persona) indicating that the attribute is not a persona attribute or too generic (e.g., living a happy life). We prompt InstructGPT-3 with 2 examples of each class for the main dimension (i.e., 10 manually labeled in-context examples).\nFor the interactivity and distinctiveness dimensions, we ask InstructGPT-3 to predict a binary label for each dimension.

These controversial labels enable further research on the ambiguities in real-world persona types and the potential stereotypes in persona judgments. In the interactivity and distinctiveness dimensions where the labeling schema is binary, disagreements of workers are fully solved by the majority voting with InstructGPT-3, though ambiguous cases may still remain.\nExpert Study However, one question that naturally arises, when employing a majority voting with InstructGPT-3 in the loop, is whether this classification decision remains accurate.  in PEACOK, and then compare their annotations to the majority voting results to check the voting accuracy. The 825 persona facts consist of 275 samples from each of the three PEACOK subsets where majority voting is employed, that is, when InstructGPT-3 agrees with one of the workers but not the other, and when both workers agree with each other but not with InstructGPT-3. Experts are required to pass a qualification test by performing 20 test annotations correctly. Furthermore, in the case of disagreements (7% of cases), a third expert re-checked the annotations of the two experts and resolved the disagreement cases. 9 Table 4 presents the accuracy and F1 of the majority voting results, compared to the re-annotations from experts as ground truth labels. We stratify the results into two cases: the two workers disagree with each other but InstructGPT-3 agrees with one of them, and both workers agree with each other but not with InstructGPT-3. We observe a high agreement between the experts and the majority vote, with an average accuracy and F1 of 0.874 and 0.865, respectively. These results validate majority voting with InstructGPT-3 in the loop, showing that InstructGPT-3 serves as a reliable third annotator when disagreements arise. Moreover, the integration of InstructGPT-3 in the verification loop costs less in terms of time and money compared to adding more human annotators.\nHowever, we note that InstructGPT-3 is not a panacea on its own. While the model effectively resolves worker disagreements, we find that its individual predictions are only correct with \u223c60% macro-F1, which is far from the \u223c85% macro-F1 with majority voting, indicating that not all PEA-COK persona relations are known by large-scale language models, and that human crowdsourcing    GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) that uses 5 randomly sampled training facts (with same relation as the testing fact) to prompt the tail knowledge generation and a zero-shot GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) baseline model.

We link facts from PEACOK to PERSONA-CHAT dialogues, thereby extending P 2 BOT's persona perception and augmenting its dialogue response generation. 12 We evaluate our models based on both original and revised interlocutor profiles provided in the ConvAI2 PERSONA-CHAT dataset, and measure the perplexity (PPL), word-level F1, and cumulative 4-gram BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) of the generated responses compared to the references.

For each interlocutor, we extract all statements in their profile, as well as first-person sentences in their utterances. Then, we follow a commonsense fact linking benchmark, ComFact (Gao et al., 2022), to link relevant facts from PEA-COK to each extracted statement or sentence. We remove linked facts that are labeled as Generic in the distinctiveness dimension, i.e., have little effect on distinguishing this persona from others.\nFor each interlocutor, we randomly sample 5 PEACOK facts that are linked to their PERSONA-CHAT profile, 13 and convert them into natural language statements to form their extended persona knowledge. 14 Our augmented model is denoted as P 2 BOT + PEACOK. To compare PEACOK's persona-centric knowledge augmentations with general commonsense augmentations, we also evaluate another baseline model P 2 BOT + ATOMIC 20 20 , where we follow Majumder et al., 2020 to extend interlocutor personas with 5 randomly sampled commonsense inferences from the COMET-ATOMIC 20 20 model (Hwang et al., 2021).\nResults In Table 7, we show that P 2 BOT + PEA-COK significantly outperforms P 2 BOT on PPL and Hits@1, 15 and has comparable F1 and BLEU scores.

We make pairwise comparisons between P 2 BOT + PEACOK and other baseline models, based on their generated responses to 200 randomly sampled dialogue histories (100 each with original and revised PERSONA-CHAT profiles). Two expert annotators from our research group manually compare four aspects of the response generation quality: fluency, whether the response is fluent and understandable, consistency, where the response is consistent with the dialogue history, engagement, whether the response is engaging and interesting, and persona expression, whether the response demonstrates persona information related to the interlocutor's profile. To ensure the fairness and reliability of our human evaluation, similar to Sec. 5.1, we require each expert to pass a qualification test on 10 pairwise comparisons, and also include a third qualified expert to re-check the evaluation results. We note that both expert annotators do not see the source model from which each response is generated.\nThe human evaluation results in Table 8 show that P 2 BOT + PEACOK generates more consistent and engaging dialogues compared to other neural baselines, demonstrating that persona commonsense knowledge is a key contributor to the conversation consistency and engagement. However, P 2 BOT + PEACOK still has room for improvement compared to human performance.\nPerhaps most interestingly, though, we find that PEACOK's impact on the consistency and engagement of dialogues is most pronounced when there are interconnections between the personas of the interlocutors. We stratify the pairwise comparison between P 2 BOT + PEACOK versus P 2 BOT from Table 8 based on the overlap of the two interlocutors' linked PEACOK knowledge. In Table 9, we show the results of this stratification across the cases where the interlocutors have 0, 1 or more than 1 shared attributes.

Figure 4 and 5 shows the screenshots of our acceptance policy, privacy policy, and task instruction used for crowdsourcing.\nMajority Voting Table 14, 15 and 16 show the prompts provided to InstructGPT-3 to label relations as the majority vote among worker disagreements (Sec. 4.3). Similar to the InstructGPT-3 tail attribute generation (Sec. 4.2), we use 2 different sets of in-context examples to handle the complexity differences in the head persona statements. The verbalizers that we use for each labeling class are characteristic, routine, plan, experience & no in the main dimension; relationship & self in the interactivity dimension; and distinctive & generic in the distinctiveness dimension.

The combinations of Routine or Habit, Self and Distinctive labels is the most frequent relation in PEACOK, which implies that individual daily activities might be the most common topic involved in human interactions. Table 18 shows several examples of persona facts in PEACOK, which showcases our knowledge graph's rich commonsense inferences on persona-grounded knowledge.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_1"], "table_ref": ["tab_2", "tab_2"]}, {"heading": "C Neural KG Analysis Details", "text": "Fact Preprocessing We develop neural knowledge generator based on the PEACOK facts whose relations are labeled as Distinctive in the third (distinctiveness) dimension. We preprocess these distinctive PEACOK facts to facilitate knowledge generation. In particular, we follow Table 19 to map each fact's relation into a textual description, and then concatenate it with the fact's head and tail personas. If the relation is labeled as Relationship in the second (interactivity) dimension, we also append its description in Table 19 to the fact's maindimension label description, i.e., one of the other four descriptions in Table 19. For example, (I am a waiter, Characteristic and Relationship, skilled at customer service) is converted into I am a waiter, here is my character trait related to other people or social groups, skilled at customer service.\nEvaluation Details We split our preprocessed facts into three sets, with size 64853, 8913 and 14112 for training, validation and testing, respectively. Note that the three sets of facts do not have overlapped head personas with each other. We evaluate tail persona generation on the 3030 unique head-relation combinations in the testing set, with the 14112 gold tail personas serving as references. Several NLG metrics are adopted for the automatic evaluation, including cumulative 4gram BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) and SkipThoughts (Kiros et al., 2015). For human evaluation, we use the same group of workers qualified for PEACOK relation classification described in Appendix A. Each fact with generated tail is evaluated by one Amazon Mechanical Turk worker, following our instruction shown in Figure 6. We pay each worker $0.20 for evaluating every 5 facts, which keeps similar hourly wage as compared to PEACOK relation classification.\nModel Training We use Kogito (Ismayilzada and Bosselut, 2022) toolkit to train the COMET-BART knowledge generator, with the default hyperparameters suggested by the toolkit. One NVIDIA TI-TAN X Pascal GPU is used to train the model for 7 epochs, which costs about 1 hour to get the highest ROUGE-L score on the validation set. For the 5-shot GPT-3 generation, we prompt the davinci endpoint with default hyperparameters suggested by the OpenAI GPT-3 platform.\nWe also train a DeBERTa (He et al., 2020) discriminator to re-rank the facts generated by COMET-BART and GPT-3. For each training fact, we create one negative example by replacing its tail persona with a randomly sampled one from another training fact, which have a different head persona but same relation. We train the DeBERTa model to discriminate true facts versus negative samples based on a binary classification loss, with hyperparameters suggested by the ComFact (Gao et al., 2022) benchmark. Four NVIDIA TITAN X Pascal GPUs are used to train the model for 6 epochs, which costs about 21 hours to get the highest F1 score on the validation set. Finally, for both COMET-BART and GPT-3, we evaluate their top-1 of 5 generated facts re-ranked by our DeBERTa discriminator, with their default decoding methods, i.e., beam search for COMET-BART and nucleus sampling for GPT-3, with 1.0 top-p sampling rate and 0.9 temperature value.", "publication_ref": ["b31", "b22", "b0", "b19", "b15", "b12"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_2", "tab_2", "tab_2"]}, {"heading": "D Persona Dialogue Agent Implementation Details", "text": "Our downstream dataset, ConvAI PERSONA-CHAT, contains 17878 and 1000 crowdsourced dialogues for training and validation, while 1015 testing dialogues are not public. In each dialogue sample, two speakers are pre-given their own persona profiles, i.e., four or five sentences of self-introductions, to conduct conversations. Based on the persona profiles, P 2 BOT uses a reinforcement learning (Sutton et al., 1999) approach to build mutual persona perception between speakers, which enhances the quality of personalized dialogue generation.  Model Training We train our knowledge augmented models (i.e., P 2 BOT w/ PEACOK and P 2 BOT w/ ATOMIC 20 20 ) with the same hyperparameters and early stopping settings as the original P 2 BOT model. Two NVIDIA TITAN X Pascal GPUs are used, which takes about 20 hours to get convergence (early stopped) on the validation set.\nHuman Evaluation For each pairwise comparison, we show the experts two responses generated by different models, with the gold dialogue history and the interlocutor persona profiles. We ask the experts to compare the two responses with regard to our four evaluation aspects (i.e., fluency, consistency, engagement and persona expression).

We find that the involved PEACOK fact help identify a potential role of the speaker, i.e., breeder inferred from milking cows and farmland, and also explain the speaker's persona of having a pet canine, i.e., dog. Therefore, compared to other baseline models, P 2 BOT w/ PEACOK generates a more consistent and engaging response, which is well associated with the counterpart's last utterance in the dialogue history, and also simultaneously conveys a related persona of the speaker.\nJudge whether the phrase describes a relationship of the person in the script, or just the person himself.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_2"]}, {"heading": "Simple Head Personas", "text": "Script: I want to be an actor.

We use the DeBERTa entity linker (instead of fact linker) to check the relevance of each fact's head and tail personas independently, without considering their in-between relations. This is because the DeBERTa fact linker from ComFact is trained on ATOMIC 20 20 relations, which cannot well identify the new relation sets of PEACOK. We link persona facts from PEACOK whose head and tail personas are both relevant to the extracted PERSONA-CHAT statement or sentence. We also include an additional set of persona facts which only have relevant tail, since the high-level head personas are not always revealed in the dialogue. Similar to the fact preprocessing described in Appendix C, we convert each linked persona fact into a natural language statement, by first following Table19to map each fact's relation into a textual description, and then concatenate it with the fact's head and tail personas.Judge whether the phrase describes a characteristic, a routine, a plan, or an experience of the person in the script.", "figure_data": "Simple Head PersonasScript: I want to be an actor.Script: I become a lonely person.Phrase: good at performingPhrase: introvertedAnswer: characteristicAnswer: characteristicScript: I want to be an actor.Script: I become a lonely person.Phrase: take acting classesPhrase: spend time aloneAnswer: routineAnswer: routineScript: I want to be an actor.Script: I become a lonely person.Phrase: get an auditionPhrase: find a partnerAnswer: planAnswer: planScript: I want to be an actor.Script: I become a lonely person.Phrase: enjoy a good playPhrase: divorce from wifeAnswer: experienceAnswer: experienceScript: I want to be an actor.Script: I become a lonely person.Phrase: play in a bandPhrase: jitteryAnswer: noAnswer: noComplex Head PersonasScript: I am an actor who is a movie star.
