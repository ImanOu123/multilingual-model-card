Our novel 3D orientation estimation is based on a variant of the Denoising Autoencoder that is trained on simulated views of a 3D model using Domain Randomization. This so-called Augmented Autoencoder has several advantages over existing methods: It does not require real, pose-annotated training data, generalizes to various test sensors and inherently handles object and view symmetries. Instead of learning an explicit mapping from input images to object poses, it provides an implicit representation of object orientations defined by samples in a latent space. Our pipeline achieves stateof-the-art performance on the T-LESS dataset both in the RGB and RGB-D domain. We also evaluate on the LineMOD dataset where we can compete with other synthetically trained approaches. We further increase performance by correcting 3D orientation estimates to account for perspective errors when the object deviates from the image center and show extended results. Our code is available here 1", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "One of the most important components of modern computer vision systems for applications such as mobile robotic manipulation and augmented reality is a reliable and fast 6D object detection module. Although, there are very encouraging recent results from Xiang et al. (2017); Kehl et al. (2017); Hoda\u0148 et al. (2017); Wohlhart and Lepetit (2015); Vidal et al. (2018); Hinterstoisser et al. (2016); Tremblay et al. (2018), a general, easily applicable, robust and fast solution is not available, yet. The reasons for this are manifold. First and foremost, current solutions are often not robust enough against typical challenges such as object occlusions, different kinds of background clutter, and dynamic changes of the environment. Second, existing methods often require certain object properties such as enough textural surface structure or an asymmetric shape to avoid confusions. And finally, current systems are not efficient in terms of run-time and in the amount and type of annotated training data they require.\nTherefore, we propose a novel approach that directly addresses these issues. Concretely, our method operates on single RGB images, which significantly increases the usability as no depth information is required. We note though that depth maps may be incorporated optionally to refine the estimation. As a first step, we build upon state-of-the-art 2D Object Detectors of (Liu et al. (2016); Lin et al. (2018)) which provide object bounding boxes and identifiers. On the resulting scene crops, we employ our novel 3D orientation estimation algorithm, which is based on a previously trained deep network architecture. While deep networks are also used in existing approaches, our approach differs in that we do not explicitly learn from 3D pose annotations during training. Instead, we implicitly learn representations from rendered 3D model views. This is accomplished by training a generalized version of the Denoising Autoencoder from Vincent et al. (2010), that we call 'Augmented Autoencoder (AAE)', using a novel Do- Fig. 1: Our full 6D Object Detection pipeline: after detecting an object (2D Object Detector), the object is quadratically cropped and forwarded into the proposed Augmented Autoencoder. In the next step, the bounding box scale ratio at the estimated 3D orientationR obj2cam is used to compute the 3D translationt obj2cam . The resulting euclidean transformation\u0124 obj2cam \u2208 R 4x4 already shows promising results as presented in Sundermeyer et al. (2018), however it still lacks of accuracy given a translation in the image plane towards the borders. Therefore, the pipeline is extended by the Perspective Correction block which addresses this problem and results in more accurate 6D pose estimates\u0124 obj2cam for objects which are not located in the image center. Additionally, given depth data, the result can be further refined (\u0124\n(ref ined) obj2cam\n) by applying an Iterative Closest Point post-processing (bottom). main Randomization strategy. Our approach has several advantages: First, since the training is independent from concrete representations of object orientations within SO(3) (e.g. quaternions), we can handle ambiguous poses caused by symmetric views because we avoid one-to-many mappings from images to orientations. Second, we learn representations that specifically encode 3D orientations while achieving robustness against occlusion, cluttered backgrounds and generalizing to different environments and test sensors. Finally, the AAE does not require any real pose-annotated training data. Instead, it is trained to encode 3D model views in a self-supervised way, overcoming the need of a large pose-annotated dataset. A schematic overview of the approach based on Sundermeyer et al. (2018) is shown in Fig 1.", "publication_ref": ["b49", "b22", "b17", "b47", "b45", "b13", "b43", "b26", "b25", "b46", "b40", "b40"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Depth-based methods (e.g. using Point Pair Features (PPF) from Vidal et al.

However, they usually rely on the computationally expensive evaluation of many pose hypotheses and do not take into account any high level features. Furthermore, existing depth sensors are often more sensitive to sunlight or specular object surfaces than RGB cameras.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized 2D object detection from RGB images (Ren et al., 2015;Liu et al., 2016;Lin et al., 2018). But, in comparison to 2D bounding box annotation, the effort of labeling real images with full 6D object poses is magnitudes higher, requires expert knowledge and a complex setup (Hoda\u0148 et al., 2017).\nNevertheless, the majority of learning-based pose estimation methods, namely Tekin et al. (2017); Wohlhart and Lepetit (2015); Brachmann et al. (2016); Rad and Lepetit (2017); Xiang et al.

However, for non-canonical views, e.g. if an object is seen from above, a change of viewpoint can be nearly equivalent to a change of inplane rotation which yields ambiguous class combinations.

In order to cope with ambiguous objects, most approaches in literature are manually adapted (Wohlhart and Lepetit, 2015;Hinterstoisser et al., 2012a;Kehl et al., 2017;Rad and Lepetit, 2017). The strategies reach from ignoring one axis of rotation (Wohlhart and Lepetit, 2015;Hinterstoisser et al., 2012a) over adapting the discretization according to the object (Kehl et al., 2017) to the training of an extra CNN to predict symmetries (Rad and Lepetit, 2017). These depict tedious, manual ways to filter out object symmetries (Fig. 2a) in advance, but treating ambiguities due to self-occlusions (Fig. 2b) and occlusions (Fig. 2c) are harder to address.\nSymmetries do not only affect regression and classification methods, but any learning-based algorithm that discriminates object views solely by fixed SO(3) representations.", "publication_ref": ["b47", "b11", "b22", "b34", "b47", "b11", "b22", "b34"], "figure_ref": ["fig_1", "fig_1", "fig_1", "fig_1"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Learning Representations of 3D orientations", "text": "We can also learn indirect pose representations that relate object views in a low-dimensional space.

In addition, the distance between different objects is maximized. Although mixing in synthetic data, the training also relies on pose-annotated sensor data. The approach is not immune against symmetries since the descriptor is built using explicit 3D orientations. Thus, the loss can be dominated by symmetric object views that appear the same but have opposite orientations which can produce incorrect average pose predictions. Balntas et al. (2017) extended this work by enforcing proportionality between descriptor and pose distances. They acknowledge the problem of object symmetries by weighting the pose distance loss with the depth difference of the object at the considered poses. This heuristic increases the accuracy on symmetric objects with respect to Wohlhart and Lepetit (2015).\nOur work is also based on learning descriptors, but in contrast we train our Augmented Autoencoders (AAEs) such that the learning process itself is independent of any fixed SO(3) representation. The loss is solely based on the appearance of the reconstructed object views and thus symmetrical ambiguities are inherently regarded. Thus, unlike Balntas et al. (2017); Wohlhart and Lepetit (2015) we abstain from the use of real labeled data during training and instead train completely self-supervised. This means that assigning 3D orientations to the descriptors only happens after the training. Kehl et al. (2016) train an Autoencoder architecture on random RGB-D scene patches from the LineMOD dataset Hinterstoisser et al. (2011). At test time, descriptors from scene and object patches are compared to find the 6D pose. Since the approach requires the evaluation of a lot of patches, it takes about 670ms per prediction. Furthermore, using local patches means to ignore holistic relations between object features which is crucial if few texture exists.

(2017); Ulrich et al. (2009)) only rely on 3D model information. Most methods like Wohlhart and Lepetit (2015); Balntas et al. (2017);Brachmann et al. (2016) make use of real pose annotated data and often even train and test on the same scenes (e.g. at slightly different viewpoints, as in the official LineMOD benchmark).\nIt is common practice to ignore in-plane rotations or to only consider object poses that appear in the dataset (Rad and Lepetit, 2017;Wohlhart and Lepetit, 2015) which also limits applicability. Symmetric object views are often individually treated (Rad and Lepetit, 2017;Balntas et al., 2017) or ignored (Wohlhart and Lepetit, 2015). The SIXD challenge (Hodan, 2017) is an attempt to make fair comparisons between 6D localization algorithms by prohibiting the use of test scene pixels. We follow these strict evaluation guidelines, but treat the harder problem of 6D detection where it is unknown which of the considered objects are present in the scene. This is especially difficult in the T-LESS dataset since objects are very similar. We train the AAEs on the reconstructed 3D models, except for object 19-23 where we train on the CAD models because the pins are missing in the reconstructed plugs. We noticed, that the geometry of some 3D reconstruction in T-LESS is slightly inaccurate which badly influences the RGB-based distance estimation (Sec. 3.6.2) since the synthetic bounding box diagonals are wrong. Therefore, in a second training run we only train on the 30 CAD models. Hoda\u0148 et al. (2016) introduced the Visible Surface Discrepancy (err vsd ), an ambiguity-invariant pose error function that is determined by the distance between the estimated and ground truth visible object depth surfaces. As in the SIXD challenge, we report the recall of correct 6D object poses at err vsd < 0.3 with tolerance \u03c4 = 20mm and > 10% object visibility. Although the Average Distance of Model Points (ADD) metric introduced by Hinterstoisser et al. (2012b) cannot handle pose ambiguities, we also present it for the LineMOD dataset following the official protocol in Hinterstoisser et al. (2012b). For objects with symmetric views (eggbox, glue), Hinterstoisser et al. (2012b) adapts the metric by calculating the average distance to the closest model point. Manhardt et al. (2018) has noticed inaccurate intrinsics and sensor registration errors between RGB and D in the LineMOD dataset. Thus, purely synthetic RGB-based approaches, although visually correct, suffer from false pose rejections.

Table 5 shows the influence of different input augmentations. It can be seen that the effect of different color augmentations is cumulative. For textureless objects, even the inversion of color channels seems to be beneficial since it prevents overfitting to synthetic color information. Furthermore, training with real object recordings provided in T-LESS with random Pascal VOC background and augmentations yields only slightly better performance than the training with synthetic data.

Table 6 presents our 6D detection evaluation on all scenes of the T-LESS dataset, which contains a high amount of pose ambiguities. Our pipeline outperforms all 15 reported T-LESS results on the 2018 BOP benchmark from Hodan et al. (2018) in a fraction of the runtime. Table 6 shows an extract of competing methods. Our RGB-only results can compete with the RGB-D learning-based approaches of Brachmann et al. (2016) and Kehl et al. (2016). Previous state-of-the-art approaches from Vidal et al. (2018); Drost et al. (2010) perform a time consuming refinement search through multiple pose hypotheses while we only perform the ICP on a single pose hypothesis. That being said, the codebook is well suited to generate multiple hypotheses using k > 1 nearest neighbors. The right part of Table 6 shows results with ground truth bounding boxes yielding an upper bound on the pose estimation performance.  The results in Table 6 show that our domain randomization strategy allows to generalize from 3D reconstructions as well as untextured CAD models as long as the considered objects are not significantly textured. Instead of a performance drop we report an increased err vsd < 0.3 recall due to the more accurate geometry of the model which results in correct bounding box diagonals and thus a better projective distance estimation in the RGB-domain.\nIn Table 8 we also compare our pipeline against state-of-the-art methods on the LineMOD dataset. Here, our synthetically trained pipeline does not reach the performance of approaches that use real pose annotated training data.\nThere are multiple issues: (1) As described in Sec 4.1 the real training and test set are strongly correlated and approaches using the real training set can over-fit to it; (2) the models provided in LineMOD are quite bad which affects both, the detection and pose estimation performance of synthetically trained approaches;\n(3) the advantage of not suffering from pose-ambiguities does not matter much in LineMOD where most object views are pose-ambiguity free; (4) We train and test poses from the whole SO(3) as opposed to only a limited range in which the test poses lie.

A weak point is the dependence on the bounding box size at test time to predict the object distance.

If the usage of depth data is clear in advance other methods for directly using depth-based  Furthermore, on strongly textured objects, the AAEs should not be trained without rendering the texture since otherwise the texture might not be distinguishable from shape at test time. The sim2real transfer on strongly reflective objects like satellites can be challenging and might require physically-based renderings. Some objects, like long, thin pens can fail because their tight object crops at training and test time appear very near from some views and very far from other views, thus hindering the learning of proper pose representa-tions.

For this demo we acquired several of the T-LESS objects. As can be seen in Figure 12, lighting conditions were dramatically different than in the test sequences from the T-LESS dataset which validates the robustness and applicability of our approach outside lab conditions. No ICP was used, so the errors in depth resulting from the scaling errors of the MobileNet, were not corrected.
