{"title": "Assessing the Scenic Route: Measuring the Value of Search Trails in Web Logs", "authors": "Ryen W White; Jeff Huang", "pub_date": "", "abstract": "Search trails mined from browser or toolbar logs comprise queries and the post-query pages that users visit. Implicit endorsements from many trails can be useful for search result ranking, where the presence of a page on a trail increases its query relevance. Following a search trail requires user effort, yet little is known about the benefit that users obtain from this activity versus, say, sticking with the clicked search result or jumping directly to the destination page at the end of the trail. In this paper, we present a logbased study estimating the user value of trail following. We compare the relevance, topic coverage, topic diversity, novelty, and utility of full trails over that provided by sub-trails, trail origins (landing pages), and trail destinations (pages where trails end). Our findings demonstrate significant value to users in following trails, especially for certain query types. The findings have implications for the design of search systems, including trail recommendation systems that display trails on search result pages.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Web search engines afford keyword access to Web content. In response to search queries, these engines return lists of Web pages ranked based on their predicted relevance. For decades, the information retrieval (IR) research community has worked extensively on algorithmic techniques to effectively rank documents (c.f. [22]). However, research in areas such as information foraging [18], berrypicking [2], and orienteering [17], suggests that individual items may be insufficient for vague or complex information needs. In such circumstances, search results may only serve as the starting points for exploration [24].\nSearch trails are a series of Web pages starting with a search query and terminating with an event such as session inactivity [33]. Although the traversal of trails following a query is common, little is known about how much value users derive from following the trail versus sticking with the origin (the clicked search result) or jumping to the destination page at the end of the trail [32]. In this paper we present a log-based study estimating the value to users of traversing multi-page search trails. Our primary aim is to estimate the benefit that trail following brings to users under different metrics versus viewing only the origin and/or destination pages. Significant differences in the performance of trails over origins and destinations would suggest that users benefit from the journey as well as the origin and the destination. Knowing if and when this is the case could help us build more effective search systems centered around trails, e.g., full trails could be shown to users directly on the results page. We estimate the value of trails, subtrails, origins, and destinations (collectively called trail sources) based on the relevance, completeness, diversity, novelty, and utility of the information they contain. We conduct this study using a log-based methodology since logs contain evidence of real user behaviors at scale and provide coverage of many types of information needs. Information need coverage is important since differences in source performance may not hold for all search tasks. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents related work on trails. Section 3 describes the primary data source used in our study, as well as the extraction and labeling of search trails, and trail statistics. Section 4 describes the experiment performed to estimate the value of trails or sub-trails, including a comparison with trail origins and trail destinations. Section 5 describes the findings of our study for all queries and different query types. Findings are discussed along with their implications in Section 6. We conclude in Section 7.", "publication_ref": ["b21", "b17", "b1", "b16", "b23", "b32", "b31"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "RELATED WORK", "text": "Vannevar Bush first introduced the concept of trails when he envisioned the memex, a theoretical proto-hypertext system to extend human memory [4]. Bush foresaw \"a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record.\" Associative trails explicitly created by trailblazing users form links between stored materials that can help others navigate. Interaction logging via browsers and toolbars has made us all (implicit) trail blazers.\nA search trail consists of an origin page, intermediate pages, and a destination page. Origin pages are the search results that start a trail, and may be referred to as landing pages in other literature. The use of query and origin pages from search engine click logs has been shown to be useful for improving search result relevance [1] [14]. Teevan et al. [24] studied users jumping directly to destination pages and introduced the concept of teleportation when they observed users issuing sophisticated queries in an attempt to navigate to a page they knew existed deep in a Web site. White et al. [32] incorporated destination pages corresponding to Web search queries into search interface prototypes and presented them to user study participants. Most users found destination pages useful when shown on the search results page after the query was submitted. Bilenko and White [3] studied full trails, including the origin, intermediate, and destination pages. They found that treating the pages in these trails as endorsements improved ranking in search engines. Individual pages in full trails have been shown to improve search results, destination pages have been shown to benefit users, and origin pages have been studied extensively in search relevance. We are the first to study the value of trails to users and directly compare trails to origins and destinations.\nTrails have been studied in domains outside of IR. Wexelblat and Maes [29] introduced annotations in Web browsers called \"footprints,\" which are trails through a Website assembled by the Website designer. Their evaluation found that users required significantly less steps to find information using their system. Freyne et al. [12] add a second dimension to footprints by displaying icons with links to offer visual cues to the user. These cues are gathered from past users and include popularity, recency, and usergenerated annotations. More recent work by Wang and Zhai [28] continues the footprint metaphor in a topic map. This topic map allows the user to navigate horizontally to related queries, and vertically to queries of different specificity. Simulated users with a predefined strategy benefited from such maps. Pirolli and Card [18] developed a sophisticated model of user behavior called information foraging derived from how animals forage for food in the wild. They use a foraging metaphor to discuss how information foragers could use cues left by previous visitors to find \"patches\" of information in a collection and consume patch information to satisfy information needs. Fu and Pirolli [13] developed and validated computational cognitive models of Web navigation behavior based on information foraging theory.\nScentTrails [16] combines browsing and searching into a single interface by highlighting potentially valuable hyperlinks. Olston and Chi perform user studies with different interfaces incorporating \"scents\" of trails in the search results. Users could find information faster and more successfully using ScentTrails than by either searching or browsing alone. O'Day and Jeffries [17] propose the orienteering analogy for understanding users' information-seeking strategies. Their qualitative study relates to ours in describing the benefits of building a system that considers the entirety of users' paths. Similarly, Bates's berrypicking [2] discusses users moving between information sources due to dynamic information needs. Search trails are extensions of these ideas into Web search, showing the routes with information to harvest, and orienting them towards the winding paths others have taken. As with orienteering and berrypicking, the origin and destination are important but the route taken in-between is also important; in this study we estimate how much benefit users gain from this journey.\nTrigg [26] introduced the concept of guided tours, whereby authors could construct sequences of pages that may be useful to others. Reich et al. [19] discuss tours and trails as tools for helping hypertext users by showing where others have gone. Tours and trails in hypertext differ; trails are marked by users at each step while tours are typically authored beforehand and may have a hierarchical structure. Reich et al. also propose following users with similar interests as they move around the collection. Beyond hypertext, Chalmers et al. [6] present a system where people who are \"recommenders\" manually construct Web navigation paths. These recommenders share their paths with others. Wheeldon and Levene [30] propose an algorithm for generating trails to assist in Web navigation. Trails are presented in a tree interface attached to the browser. User study participants expressed satisfaction with the trails, noting that seeing the relationship between links helped, and found trails to be useful as a navigational aid.\nThe study described in this paper differs from previous work in that we are focused on estimating the value that trail following brings to users, rather than describing existing trail traversal behavior, modeling user behavior, or using trails or computational models to recommend future actions. If findings show that users benefit from trail following, likely post-query trails could be considered in search system design and even as units of retrieval [23].", "publication_ref": ["b3", "b0", "b13", "b23", "b31", "b2", "b28", "b11", "b27", "b17", "b12", "b15", "b16", "b1", "b25", "b18", "b5", "b29", "b22"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "SEARCH TRAILS", "text": "In this section we describe the logs, trail mining from the logs, automatic classification of trail pages, and summary trail statistics.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Log Data", "text": "The primary source of data for this study was the anonymized logs of URLs visited by users who opted in to provide data through a widely-distributed browser toolbar.

Intranet and secure (https) URL visits were excluded at the source to maintain user privacy. In order to remove variability caused by geographic and linguistic variation in search behavior, we only include entries generated in the English speaking United States locale. The results described in this paper are based on a sample of URL visits during a three-month period from March 2009 through May 2009, representing millions of URL visits from 100,000 unique users. The user sample was selected at random from a larger set of twelve million users after we had pre-filtered the data to remove several thousand extremely-active outlier users, all of whom issued over one thousand queries per day on average across the three-month period. These highvolume users were likely automated traffic. For each user, we required an adequate number of Web page visits to create their long-term search history that was used to evaluate source novelty (described in more detail later). Therefore, in addition to removing outliers, we also only selected users who issued at least 30 queries per month from March 2009 to May 2009 inclusive.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Trail Mining", "text": "We mined tens of millions of search trails from the May 2009 logs, referred to hereafter as . As defined by White and Drucker [33], search trails consist of a temporally-ordered sequence of URLs beginning with a search engine query and terminating with either: (i) another query, (ii) a period of user inactivity of 30 or more minutes, or (iii) the termination of the browser instance or tab. The 30-minute inactivity timeout is commonly used to demarcate sessions in Web log analyses (e.g., [9]). We chose to use search trails rather than session trails (which comprise multiple queries) to lessen the likelihood of query skew, where user intent shifts over the course of the session, making it challenging to associate visited pages to the original query. Figure 1 illustrates a search trail, expressed as a Web behavior graph [5]. The trail starts with a search engine query ( 1) (which also includes the searchengine result page (SERP)) and comprises a set of pages visited until the trail terminates with a new query or an inactivity timeout. The nodes of the graph represent Web pages that the user has visited: rectangles represent page views and rounded rectangles represent search engine result pages. Vertical lines represent backtracking to an earlier state (e.g., returning to a page of results in a search engine after following an unproductive link). A \"back\" arrow, such as that below 4, indicates that the user has requested to visit a page seen earlier in the search trail. Time runs left to right and then from top to bottom. In addition to the complete trail, also marked on Figure 1 are the origin (the search result, 2), the destination (the trail's terminal page, 5), and the pages between origin and destination (in this case 3, 4, 3, 2 ).

Millions of unique URLs were present in the set of all trails mined from the toolbar logs. This made the evaluation of coverage, novelty, and diversity challenging as it was impractical to download all pages and comparisons based on URLs would be severely limited. To address this challenge, we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory, the Open Directory Project (ODP) (dmoz.org). Given the large number of pages involved, we used automatic classification. Our classifier assigned labels to pages based on the ODP using a similar approach to Shen et al. [21]. Classification began with URLs present in the ODP and incrementally pruned non-present URLs one path level at a time until a match was found or miss declared.

It was important to have these sources in all trails used since we wanted to compare their value. \uf0b7 To ensure that origin pages were reached through a SERP click, we required that the first non-SERP page in the trail be connected to the SERP with a hyperlink click (i.e., the referrer of the origin page must be a SERP).

Trained judges assigned relevance labels on a six-point scale-Bad, Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent and Perfect-to top-ranked pooled Web search results for each query from the Google, Yahoo!, and Bing search engines as part of a separate search engine assessment activity. This provided hundreds of relevance judgments for each query. These judgments allowed us to estimate the relevance of information encountered at different parts of the trails. For each trail in , we computed the average relevance judgment score for each source. Each page in the trail was used at most once in relevance score calculations, even if it appeared multiple times in the trail. This discounted revisitation, since diminishing returns from each repeat visit to a page in the same trail were likely. In this analysis we only used trails for which we had a relevance judgment for the origin page, the destination page, and at least one intermediate page.

To estimate the coverage of each trail source, we first constructed a set of query interest models representing the dominant intents associated with each query in . These models served as the ground truth for our estimates of coverage (in this subsection) and diversity (in the next subsection).\nEach constructed query interest model is assumed to contain most of the significant themes for the query. A query's interest model comprises the ODP category labels assigned to the URLs in the union of the top-200 search results for that query from Google, Yahoo! and Bing. ODP category labels are grouped and their frequency values are normalized such that across all labels they sum to one. For example, the highest-weighted labels in the query interest model for [solar system discoveries], and their associated normalized frequencies ( ), are shown in Figure 2. To improve the reliability of our coverage estimates, we selected a set of query interest models, , that were required to be based on at least 100 fully-labeled search results (i.e., were not missing a label and did not have a label from an ignored ODP category) and were based only on labels with a frequency count of at least five (to reduce label noise). was modified to include only trails originating from queries with interest models in .

Exposure to different perspectives and ideas may help users with complex or exploratory search tasks. Indeed, existing search engines already consider diversity in the search results they present to satisfy more users with the first few results.\nTo estimate the diversity of information provided by each trail source we use an approach similar to our coverage estimation. We generate trail interest models for each trail source and compare those with the relevant query interest model to estimate diversity. The main difference between how the estimates of coverage and diversity lies in whether normalized label frequency is considered. When estimating coverage we want to establish the fraction of appearing in (i.e., label frequency is used). In contrast, when we estimate diversity, we only count the number of unique category labels from that appear in (i.e., frequency is ignored).\nFor each trail in originating with one of the queries in , we created a source interest model comprising ODP category labels and associated frequencies for origin, destination, sub-trail, and full-trail.

Novel information may help users learn about a new subject area or broaden their understanding of an area with which they are already familiar.\nTrails with novelty contain information that users have not encountered for a query. Unlike coverage and diversity, the novelty provided by a trail source may depend on both the query and the user. For example, what is new topic-related information for one individual may not be new information for another. Therefore, to estimate the novelty of the information provided by each trail source, we first had to construct a model of each user's general interest in the query topic based on historic data. To do this, we leveraged users' search trails for the two-month period from March to April 2009 inclusive (referred to hereafter as ), and constructed historic interest models , for all user-query pairs. Each interest model , whose query was present in , comprised a distribution of ODP category labels (and associated nor-malized frequencies) similar to those used in earlier coverage and diversity estimates. Only labels appearing in the query interest model are included in . The historic interest model is therefore a subset of focused on a given user's history with that query. White et al. [31] used a similar approach to depict longterm user interests. We estimate the novelty of each trail source relative to the historic interest model for the user and the query.\nFor each trail in , we built source interest models to estimate the source novelty based on whether it contained topic-related information not in .

Dwelling on a page for a significant amount of time implies that a user may be deriving utility from it. Indeed, prior research has shown that during search activity, a dwell time of 30 seconds or more on a Web page can be indicative of page utility [11]. We apply this threshold in our analysis and across all trails in , we estimate the fraction of page views from the origin, destination, sub-trail, and full-trail that exceed this dwell time threshold.\nIn all metrics used in this study, a higher value is regarded as a more positive outcome. The metrics are computed for each trail, then micro-averaged within each query, and then macro-averaged across all queries to obtain a single value for each source-metric pair. This procedure ensures that all queries are treated equally in the analysis and popular queries are not allowed to dominate the aggregated metric values for each source. Although we might expect sub-trails and full-trails to have higher metric scores than origins or destinations (simply because they have more pages), it is the extent that the metrics' values increase from these sources that lets us estimate the additional value of trails and sub-trails.

Posthoc testing revealed significant differences between sub-trails / full-trails and origins / destinations (all < 0.01). On average, trails provide more novel information than origins or destinations. In turn, destinations provide slightly more novel information than origins, but differences were not significant ( 0.12).", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_2", "tab_2"]}, {"heading": "Utility:", "text": "We also studied the utility of each trail source. To estimate utility for a given Web page from the logs, we used a 30second page dwell time threshold selected based on previous work [11]. For each of the sources across all trails in , we computed the fraction of trails for which each source contained a useful page (i.e., a page with a dwell time equaled or exceeded the 30-second threshold). These values are shown in the \"All\" column of Table 1. Also shown are the percentage differences between non-origin sources and origins. The findings show that just under half of origins and destinations are useful, around 60% of sub-trails have useful pages, and almost two-thirds of full-trails contain useful pages. Statistical analysis of the findings revealed significant differences between the sources in terms of their estimated utility ( (3,8708) = 3.3, .01). Post-hoc testing revealed that all sources differed from trail origins (destinations: = .03; subtrails:\n.01; full-trails: .01). It seems that users find nonorigin pages more useful than origin pages. This may be because origin pages are search results and may only be the starting points for a search task or sub-task [24].\nOne important factor that may cause variation in the effectiveness of search trails is the nature of the search query. Downey et al. [10] showed that user behavior following a query varied significantly with query popularity. Teevan et al. showed that the frequency with which a query is reissued by a given user over a period of time (so-called \"re-finding\" behavior) affects that user's search interactions for that particular query [25]. To test whether such factors influenced the source value we varied query popularity and history as part of our experimental design. In the remainder of this section we report on the findings of this analysis.", "publication_ref": ["b10", "b23", "b9", "b24"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_2"]}, {"heading": "Effect of Query Popularity", "text": "To study the effect of query popularity on source value, we created a tripartite division of queries in , grouping them into low, medium, and high, based on user frequency in . Low popularity queries were issued by at most one user in , medium popularity queries were issued by between 1 and 100 users in , and high popularity queries were issued by over 100 users in . Table 1 presents findings on the effect of query popularity on source performance for each of the five metrics we study. On all metrics, we observe a trend that as query popularity increases, each of the metric values also increases. The relative ordering and percentage gains from the trail sources remain consistent across all five metrics. However, within each metric, differences in the values obtained for the three query popularity groupings are not significant using a two-way independent measures ANOVA with source and query popularity group as the factors (source (rows): all .02; popularity (columns): all .13). -statistics for all performed ANOVA are not reported to avoid crowding the paper. Small increases in coverage as query popularity increases may be attributable to the dominance of the intent associated with the query. More popular queries are more likely to have a single dominant intent, giving the category label for that intent a high weight ( from Equation 1). Since coverage derives from , we are likely to observe increases in coverage as a dominant intent with a high . Improvements in search engine performance as query frequency increases (already noted in [10]) may account for some of the slight increases in relevance and utility with popularity (Table 1).", "publication_ref": ["b9"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_2", "tab_2"]}, {"heading": "Effect of Query History", "text": "We also studied the effect of query history on the value of each of the four trail sources. We divided queries into three groups-none, some, and lots-based on the number of times they were issued by a particular user in . Queries in none appeared in but did not appear in , queries in some appeared in and were issued by a particular user 30 times or less in (i.e., on average less than once every two days), and queries in lots appeared in and were those issued by a particular user more than 30 times in (i.e., on average more than once per two days). Table 1 presents findings on the effect of query history on source performance for each of the five metrics. From the findings, it seems that as query history increases, there is a mixed effect on the five metrics. However, within each metric all differences between sources and between query history groupings are significant, as shown by a two-way independent measures ANOVA with source and query history grouping as the factors (source (rows): all .001; history (columns): all .001). We found that relevance and utility rise across all sources given increased refinding behavior. This is perhaps because users are more familiar with the query topic and are more able to identify relevant information. Similar findings have been reported in previous work on topic familiarity (e.g., [15]). In contrast, coverage, diversity, and novelty decrease, perhaps as a result of a reduced variance in the pages visited. Such consistency in interaction behavior for queries with high re-finding rates has been reported previously [27].", "publication_ref": ["b14", "b26"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_2"]}, {"heading": "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS", "text": "We have demonstrated that following search trails provides users with significant additional benefit in terms of coverage, diversity, novelty, and utility over origins and destinations. Although more work is required to supplement the methodology used in our study and further understand the impact of experimental decisions such as only studying search trails that could be fully-labeled using ODP lookup, our log analysis helps establish the value of trails to users and inform search system design.\nWe showed that full-trails and sub-trails provided significantly more coverage, diversity, novelty, and utility, versus trail origins and destinations. The one metric for which we did not obtain significant differences between origin and non-origin sources was relevance. Trends in the findings suggest that trails were less relevant than origins. This may be related to the definition of relevance in this study. Our relevance judgments are assigned to pairs of queries and search results. However, during the session, user intent may shift and the relevance to the initial query is dynamic [2]. Pages encountered on the trails may be relevant but not appear so due to these shifts. More work is required on how relevance changes during browsing and to understand the relevance benefit from trails. Enhancements include studying the cumulative relevance of trail information, considering relevance changes, and devising proxies for relevance similar to that used for utility.\nDestinations were more useful and led to a slight novelty increase over origins. This confirms some of the findings of White et al. [32], who showed in a user study that destinations were a useful addition to the results interface. In retrospect, this agrees with expectations that users will give more attention, and hence dwell on the destination page. In information foraging theory [18] where this corresponds to a food patch, users satisfy some or all of their need and do not pursue the information scent further.\nWhile destinations were useful in one metric, adding intermediate pages contributed to gains in several metrics, notably in novelty, diversity, and utility, where the differences between origins and sub-trails are substantial. The success of sub-trails suggests that users may not need to traverse full-trails to derive significant value from post-query navigation. As expected, full-trails provide even more benefit than sub-trails; full-trails are sub-trails plus destinations. Although the findings of our study appear to support trail recommendation, they also suggest that the nature of the query is important. For some queries, the trails might be useful in supporting exploration, but for other queries, especially for focused tasks, presenting trail information might be a hindrance.\nQuestions remain about how to select trails and how to integrate trails into the SERP. Popular search trails are typically short and obvious, so we need to consider diverse and unexpected trails, perhaps leveraging popular sub-trails as well as full trails in trail selection algorithms. Trail selection methods could discount trails with numerous cases of rapid backtracking or maximize relevance, coverage, diversity, novelty, and utility with the shortest path. Alternatively, we can personalize trail recommendation by weighting trails based on the extent of the current user's refinding behavior or perform a priori trail analysis to recommend trails when the destination is unclear (i.e., users end up on many pages), and present trail destinations when the destination is clear (i.e., many users end up at the same page). Trails can be presented as an alternative to result lists, as instant answers above result lists, in pop-ups shown after hovering over a result, below each result along with the snippet and URL, or even on the click trail a user is following. Follow-up user studies and large-scale flights will further analyze trail appropriateness for different queries and compare trail selection algorithms and trail presentation methods.", "publication_ref": ["b1", "b31", "b17"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "In this paper we have presented a study estimating the value of search trails to users. Our log-based methodology has allowed us to systematically compare the estimated value of trails to other trail components: trail origins (clicked search results), the trail destinations (terminal trail pages), and sub-trails comprising the origin plus intermediate pages. We studied the relevance, coverage, diversity, novelty, and utility of each of the four sources using metrics devised for this purpose, human relevance judgments, historic log data, and URL classification where appropriate. When we varied the query by overall popularity, the values of each metric increased with query frequency. The evaluation showed that full-trails and sub-trails provide users with significantly more topic coverage, topic diversity, and novelty than trail origins, and slightly more useful but slightly less relevant information than the origins. Our findings show that there is value in the trail (the scenic route), as well as the origin and the destination. These findings vary slightly by query popularity over all users and significantly by the level of re-finding performed by a user for a given query.
