Driven by mutual benefits and regulations, there is a demand for healthcare institutes to share patient data with various parties for research purposes. However, health data in its raw form often contains sensitive information about individuals, and publishing such data will violate their privacy. The current practice in data sharing primarily relies on policies and guidelines on the types of data that can be shared and agreements on the use of shared data. This approach alone may lead to excessive data distortion or insufficient protection. In this paper, we study the challenges in a real-life informationsharing scenario in the Hong Kong Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service (BTS) and propose a new privacy model, together with a data anonymization algorithm, to effectively preserve individuals' privacy and meet the information requirements specified by the BTS.\nFigure 1 illustrates the data flow in the BTS. After collecting and examining the blood collected from donors, the BTS distributes the blood to different public hospitals. The hospitals collect and maintain the health records of their patients and transfuse the blood to the patients if necessary. The blood transfusion information, such as the patient data, type of surgery, names of medical practitioners in charge, and reason for transfusion, is clearly documented and is stored in the database owned by each individual hospital. Periodically, the public hospitals are required to submit the blood usage data, together with the patient-specific surgery data, to the BTS for the purpose of data analysis. This BTS case illustrates a typical dilemma in information sharing and privacy protection faced by many health institutes. For example, licensed hospitals in California are also required to submit specific demographic data on every discharged patient [5]. Our proposed solution, designed for the BTS case, will also benefit other health institutes that face similar challenges in information sharing. We summarize the concerns and challenges of the BTS case as follows.\nPrivacy concern: Giving the BTS access to blood transfusion data for data analysis is clearly legitimate. However, it raises some concerns on patients' privacy. The patients are willing to submit their data to a hospital because they consider the hospital to be a trustworthy entity. Yet, the trust in the hospital may not necessarily be transitive to a third party. Many agencies and institutes consider that the released data is privacy-preserved if explicit identifying information, such as name, social security number, address, and telephone number, is removed. However, substantial research has shown that simply removing explicit identifying information is insufficient for privacy protection. Sweeney [20] showed that an individual can be re-identified by simply matching other attributes, called quasi-identifiers (QID), such as gender, date of birth, and postal code. Below, we illustrate the privacy threats by a simplified BTS example. Example 1. Consider the raw patient data in Table 1, where each record represents a surgery case with the patientspecific information. Job, Sex, and Age are quasi-identifying attributes. The hospital wants to release Table 1 to the BTS for the purpose of classification analysis on the class attribute, T ransf use, which has two values, Y and N , indicating whether or not the patient has received blood transfusion. Without a loss of generality, we assume that the only sensitive value in Surgery is T ransgender. The hospital expresses concern on two types of privacy threats:\nIdentity linkage: If a record in the table is so specific that not many patients match it, releasing the data may lead to linking the patient's record and, therefore, her received surgery. Suppose that the adversary knows that the target patient is a M over and his age is 34. Hence, record #3, together with his sensitive value (T ransgender in this case), can be uniquely identified since he is the only M over who is 34 years old in the raw data.\nAttribute linkage: If a sensitive value occurs frequently together with some QID attributes, then the sensitive information can be inferred from such attributes even though the exact record of the patient cannot be identified. Suppose the adversary knows that the patient is a male of age 34. In such case, even though there exist two such records (#1 and #3), the adversary can infer that the patient has received a T ransgender surgery with 100% confidence since both the records contain T ransgender.\nHigh-dimensionality: Many privacy models, such as K-anonymity [18] [20] and its extensions [14][23], have been proposed to thwart privacy threats caused by identity and attribute linkages in the context of relational databases. The usual approach is to generalize the records into equivalence groups so that each group contains at least K records with respect to some QID attributes, and the sensitive values in each QID group are diversified enough to disorient confident inferences. However, [1] has shown that when the number of QID attributes is large, that is, when the dimensionality of data is high, most of the data have to be suppressed in order to achieve K-anonymity. Our experiments confirm this curse of high-dimensionality on K-anonymity [1]. Applying K-anonymity on the high-dimensional patient data would significantly degrade the data quality. In order to overcome this bottleneck, we exploit one of the limitations of the adversary: in real-life privacy attacks, it is very difficult for an adversary to acquire all the information of a target patient because it requires non-trivial effort to gather each piece of prior knowledge from so many possible values. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the adversary's prior knowledge is bounded by at most L values of the QID at-tributes of the patient. Based on this assumption, we define a new privacy model called LKC-privacy for anonymizing high-dimensional data.\nThe general intuition of LKC-privacy is to ensure that every combination of values in QID j \u2286 QID with maximum length L in the data table T is shared by at least K records, and the confidence of inferring any sensitive values in S is not greater than C, where L, K, C are thresholds and S is a set of sensitive values specified by the data holder (the hospital). LKC-privacy bounds the probability of a successful identity linkage to be \u2264 1/K and the probability of a successful attribute linkage to be \u2264 C, provided that the adversary's prior knowledge does not exceed L. Table 2 shows an example of an anonymous table that satisfies (2, 2, 50%)-privacy by generalizing all the values from Table 1 according to the taxonomies in Figure 2. (Ignore the dashed curve for now.) Every possible value of QID j with maximum length 2 in Table 2 (namely, QID1, QID2, and QID 3 in Figure 2) is shared by at least 2 records, and the confidence of inferring the sensitive value T ransgender is not greater than 50%. In contrast, enforcing traditional 2anonymity will require further generalization. For example, in order to make P rof essional, M, [30 \u2212 60) to satisfy traditional 2-anonymity, we may further generalize [1 \u2212 30) and [30 \u2212 60) to [1 \u2212 60), resulting in much higher utility loss.\nInformation needs: The BTS wants to perform two types of data analysis on the blood transfusion data collected from the hospitals. First, it wants to obtain some general count statistics. Second, it wants to employ the surgery information as training data for building a classification model on blood transfusion. One frequently raised question is: To avoid the privacy concern, why doesn't the hospital simply release the statistical data or a classifier to the BTS? The BTS wants to have access to the blood transfusion data, not statistics, from the hospitals for several reasons. First, the practitioners in hospitals have no expertise and interest in doing the data mining. They simply want to share the patient data with the BTS, who needs the health data for legitimate reasons. Second, having access to the data, the BTS has much better flexibility to perform the required data analysis. It is impractical to continuously request practitioners in a hospital to produce different types of statistical information and fine-tune the data mining results for research purposes.\nContributions: The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, we use the BTS as a real-life example to present the challenges of privacy-aware information sharing for data analysis. Second, to thwart the privacy threats caused by identity and attribute linkage, we propose a new privacy model called LKC-privacy that overcomes the challenge of anonymizing high-dimensional relational data without significantly compromising the data quality (Section 3). Third, we present an efficient anonymization algorithm for achieving LKC-privacy with two different adaptations. The first adaptation maximizes the information preserved for classification analysis; the second one minimizes the distortion on the anonymous data for general data analysis. Minimizing distortion is useful when the particular information requirement is unknown during information sharing or the shared data is used for various kinds of data mining tasks (Section 4). Fourth, experiments demonstrate that our developed algorithm is flexible and scalable enough to handle large volumes of blood transfusion data that in-clude both categorical and numerical attributes. In 2008, the BTS received 150,000 records from the public hospitals (Section 5).", "publication_ref": ["b4", "b19", "b17", "b19", "b0", "b0"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0", "fig_6", "fig_6"], "table_ref": ["tab_0", "tab_0", "tab_1", "tab_1"]}, {"heading": "RELATED WORK", "text": "There is a large body of work on anonymizing relational data. Traditional K-anonymity [18] [20], -diversity [14], and confidence bounding [23] are based on a predefined set of QID attributes. (\u03b1, k)-anonymity [24] further requires every QID group to satisfy both K-anonymity and confidence bounding. As discussed earlier, these single QID-based approaches suffer from the curse of high dimensionality [1] and render the high-dimensional data useless for data mining. In this paper, we solve the problem of dimensionality by assuming that the adversary knows at most L values of QID attributes of any target patient. [6] proposes a new privacy model called differential privacy, which ensures that the removal or addition of a single database record does not significantly affect the overall privacy of the database. Yet, the randomization approach is not applicable to the BTS case because they require data truthfulness at the record level. [8] presents a top-down refinement (TDR) method to flexibly K-anonymize various types of attributes; however, their method does not take attribute linkage and highdimensionality into consideration.\nThere are some recent works on anonymizing high dimensional transaction data [10][21] [26] [27]. [10] divides the transaction data into public and private items; the public items are grouped together based on similarity. Each group is then associated with a set of private items so that the probability of linking private items from public items is bounded. The idea is similar to the privacy model of Anatomy [25]. The methods presented in [21][26][27] model the adversary's power by a maximum number of known items as prior knowledge. This assumption is similar to ours, but our problem has major differences. First, a transaction is a set of items, whereas our health data is relational. Second, we have different privacy and utility measures. The privacy model of [21] is based on only K-anonymity and does not consider attribute linkages. [26] and [27] aim at minimizing data distortion and preserving frequent item sets, respectively, while we aim at preserving classification quality. Finally, [26] and [27] use suppression, while we use generalization and discretization for anonymizing various types of attributes.\nMany techniques have been previously proposed to preserve privacy, but only a few have considered the goal for classification. [12] show that some simple statistical information, like means and correlations, can be preserved by adding noise and swapping values. This technique is studied in data mining for classification [3]. In these works, privacy was measured by how closely the original values of a masked attribute can be estimated, which is very different from the notion of anonymity that quantifies how uniquely an individual can be linked with sensitive information. [28] propose a privacy-preserving approach for building cox regression model. However, unlike this paper, they only target to build an analysis model and fall in the category of privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) research.\nIyengar [11] presented the anonymity problem for classification and proposed a genetic algorithmic solution. The idea is to encode each state of generalization as a \"chromosome\" and data distortion into the fitness function. Then   [4] also addressed the classification problem using the same classification metric (CM) of [11]. Recently, LeFevre et al. [13] proposed another anonymization technique for classification using multidimensional recoding. Unlike the random genetic evolution and the bottom-up generalization, our approach produces a progressive generalization process that users can step through to determine a desired trade-off of privacy and accuracy. We also handle both categorical and numerical attributes. Moreover, all the proposed models for classification analysis do not address the problem of high-dimensionality, which is a primary contribution of this paper.", "publication_ref": ["b17", "b19", "b13", "b22", "b23", "b0", "b5", "b7", "b9", "b25", "b26", "b9", "b24", "b20", "b25", "b26", "b25", "b26", "b11", "b2", "b27", "b10", "b3", "b10", "b12"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "PROBLEM DEFINITION", "text": "We first describe the privacy and information requirements, followed by a problem statement.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Privacy Measure", "text": "Suppose a data holder (e.g., a hospital) wants to publish a health data table T (ID, D1, . . . , Dm, Class, Sens) (e.g., Table 1) to some recipient (e.g., BTS) for data analysis. ID is an explicit identifier, such as SSN , and it should be removed before publication. Each D i is either a categorical or a numerical attribute. Sens is a sensitive attribute. A record has the form v1, . . . , vm, cls, s , where vi is a domain value of Di, cls is a class value of Class, and s is a sensitive value of Sens. The data holder wants to protect against linking an individual to a record or some sensitive value in T through some subset of attributes called a quasi-identifier or QID, where QID \u2286 {D1, . . . , Dm}.\nOne recipient, who is an adversary, seeks to identify the record or sensitive values of some target victim patient V in T . As explained in Section 1, we assume that the adversary knows at most L values of QID attributes of the victim patient. We To thwart the identity and attribute linkages on any patient in the table T , we require every qid with a maximum length L in the anonymous table to be shared by at least a certain number of records, and the ratio of sensitive value(s) in every group cannot be too high. Our privacy model, LKC-privacy, reflects this intuition. The data holder specifies the thresholds L, K, and C. The maximum length L reflects the assumption of the adversary's power. LKC-privacy guarantees that the probability of a successful identity linkage to be \u2264 1/K and the probability of a successful attribute linkage to be \u2264 C. LKCprivacy has several nice properties that make it suitable for anonymizing high-dimensional data. First, it only requires a subset of QID attributes to be shared by at least K records. This is a major relaxation from traditional K-anonymity, based on a very reasonable assumption that the adversary has limited power. Second, LKC-privacy generalizes several traditional privacy models. K-anonymity [18][20] is a special case of LKC-privacy with L = |QID| and C = 100%, where |QID| is the number of QID attributes in the data table. Confidence bounding [23] is also a special case of LKCprivacy with L = |QID| and K = 1. (\u03b1, k)-anonymity [24] is also a special case of LKC-privacy with L = |QID|, K = k, and C = \u03b1. Thus, the data holder can still achieve the traditional models, if needed.", "publication_ref": ["b17", "b22", "b23"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_0"]}, {"heading": "Utility Measure", "text": "The measure of data utility varies depending on the data analysis task to be performed on the published data. Based on the information requirements specified by the BTS, we define two utility measures. First, we aim at preserving the maximal information for classification analysis. Second, we aim at minimizing the overall data distortion when the data analysis task is unknown.\nIn this BTS project, we propose a top-down specialization algorithm to achieve LKC-privacy. The general idea is to anonymize a table by a sequence of specializations starting from the topmost general state in which each attribute has the topmost value of its taxonomy tree [8]. We assume that a taxonomy tree is specified for each categorical attribute in QID. A leaf node represents a domain value and a parent node represents a less specific value. For a numerical attribute in QID, a taxonomy tree can be grown at runtime, where each node represents an interval, and each non-leaf node has two child nodes representing some optimal binary split of the parent interval. Figure 2 shows a dynamically grown taxonomy tree for Age.\nA specialization, written v \u2192 child(v), where child(v) denotes the set of child values of v, replaces the parent value v with the child value that generalizes the domain value in a record. A specialization is valid if the specialization results in a table satisfying the anonymity requirement after the specialization. A specialization is performed only if it is valid. The specialization process can be viewed as pushing the \"cut\" of each taxonomy tree downwards. A cut of the taxonomy tree for an attribute Di, denoted by Cuti, contains exactly one value on each root-to-leaf path. Figure 2 shows a solution cut indicated by the dashed curve representing the anonymous Table 2. Our specialization starts from the topmost cut and pushes down the cut iteratively by specializing some value in the current cut until violating the anonymity requirement. In other words, the specialization process pushes the cut downwards until no valid specialization is possible. Each specialization tends to increase data utility and decrease privacy because records are more distinguishable by specific values. We define two utility measures depending on the information requirement to evaluate the \"goodness\" of a specialization.", "publication_ref": ["b7"], "figure_ref": ["fig_6", "fig_6"], "table_ref": ["tab_1"]}, {"heading": "Case 1: Score for Classification Analysis", "text": "For the requirement of classification analysis, we use information gain, denoted by Inf oGain(v), to measure the good-ness of a specialization.

Then, apply Best to T and update \u222aCut i (Line 5). Finally, update the Score of the affected candidates due to the specialization (Line 6). The algorithm terminates when there are no more valid candidates in \u222aCut i . In other words, the algorithm terminates if any further specialization would lead to a violation of the LKC-privacy requirement. An important property of PAIS is that the LKC-privacy is anti-monotone with respect to a specialization: if a generalized table violates LKC-privacy before a specialization, it remains violated after the specialization because a specialization never increases the |T [qid]| and never decreases the maximum P (s|qid). This anti-monotonic property guarantees that the final solution cut is a sub-optimal solution. PAIS is modified from TDR [8], which is originally designed for achieving only K-anonymity, not LKC-privacy. One major difference is the validity check in Line 6, which will be discussed in detail in Section 4.3.\nExample 2. Consider Table 1 with L = 2, K = 2, C = 50%, and QID = {Job, Sex, Age}.

We employ a data structure, called Taxonomy Indexed PartitionS (TIPS) [8], to facilitate this operation. This data structure is also crucial for updating Score(x) for candidates x. The general idea is to group data records according to their generalized records on QID. Definition 4.1 (TIPS). TIPS is a tree structure with each root-to-leaf path represents a generalized record over QID. Each leaf node stores the set of data records having the same generalized record for all the QID attributes along the path. Each path is called a path partition. For each x in \u222aCuti, Px denotes a path partition whose generalized record contains x, and Link x denotes the link of all P x , with the head of Link x stored with x.\nAt any time, the generalized data is represented by the path partitions of TIPS, but the original data records remain unchanged. Link x provides a direct access to T [x], the set of data records generalized to the value x. Initially, TIPS has only one path partition containing all data records, generalized to the topmost value on every attribute in QID.\nIn each iteration, we perform the best specialization Best by refining the path partitions on Link Best .\nUpdating TIPS: We refine each path partition P Best found on Link Best as follows. For each value c in child(Best), a new partition Pc is created from PBest, and data records in PBest are split among the new partitions: Pc contains a data record in P Best if c generalizes the corresponding domain value in the record. An empty P c is removed. Link c is created to link up all Pc's for the same c. Also, link Pc to every Linkx to which PBest was previously linked, except for Link Best . We emphasize that this is the only operation in the whole algorithm that requires accessing data records. The overhead of maintaining Link x is small. For each attribute in \u222aQIDj and each path partition on LinkBest, there are at most |child(Best)| \"relinkings\", or at\nmost | \u222a QID j | \u00d7 |Link Best | \u00d7 |child(Best)| \"relinkings\" in total for applying Best.\nExample 4.

Blood is a real-life blood transfusion dataset owned by an anonymous health institute. Blood has 62 attributes after removing explicit identifiers; 41 of them are QID attributes. Blood Group represents the Class attribute with 8 possible values. Diagnosis Codes, which has 15 possible values representing 15 categories of diagnosis, is considered to be the sensitive attribute. The remaining attributes are neither quasi-identifiers nor sensitive. Blood contains 10,000 blood transfusion records in 2008. Each record represents one incident of blood transfusion. The publicly available Adult dataset [16] is a de facto benchmark for testing anonymization algorithms [4][8][11][14][15][22][23]. Adult has 45,222 census records on 6 numerical attributes, 8 categorical attributes, and a binary Class column representing two income levels, \u226450K or >50K. See [8] for the description of attributes. We consider Divorced and Separated in the attribute Marital-status as sensitive, and the remaining 13 attributes as QID.

For classification models, we use the well-known C4.5 classifier [17]. To better visualize the cost and benefit of our approach, we measure additional errors: Baseline Error (BE) is the error measured on the raw data without generalization. BE \u2212 CE represents the cost in terms of classification quality for achieving a given LKC-privacy requirement. A naive method to avoid identity and attributes linkages is to simply remove all QID attributes. Thus, we also measure upper bound error (U E), which is the error on the raw data with all QID attributes removed. U E \u2212 CE represents the benefit of our method over the naive approach.\nTo evaluate the impact on general analysis quality (Case 2 in Section 3.2.2), we use all records for generalization and measure the discernibility ratio (DR) on the final anonymous data.\nDR = qid |T [qid]| 2 |T | 2\n.

This setting allows us to measure the performance of the algorithm against identity linkages for a fixed C. CE generally increases as K or L increases. However, the increase is not monotonic. For example, the error drops slightly when K increases from 20 to 40 for L = 4. This is due to the fact that generalization has removed some noise from the data, resulting in a better classification structure in a more general state. For the same reason, some test cases on L = 2 and L = 4 have CE < BE, implying that generalization not only achieves the given LKC-privacy requirement but sometimes may also improve the classification quality. BE = 22.1% and U E = 44.1%. For L = 2 and L = 4, CE \u2212 BE spans from -2.9% to 5.2% and U E \u2212 CE spans from 16.8% to 24.9%, suggesting that the cost for achieving LKC-privacy is small, but the benefit is large when L is not large. However, as L increases to 6, CE quickly increases to about 40%, the cost increases to about 17%, and the benefit decreases to 5%. For a greater value of L, the difference between LKC-privacy and K-anonymity is very small in terms of classification error since more generalized data does not necessarily worse classification error. This result confirms  Figure 4b depicts the discernibility ratio DR with adversary's knowledge L = 2, 4, 6, anonymity threshold 20 \u2264 K \u2264 100, and a fixed confidence threshold C = 20%. DR generally increases as K increases, so it exhibits some trade-off between data privacy and data utility. As L increases, DR increases quickly because more generalization is required to ensure each equivalence group has at least K records. To illustrate the benefit of our proposed LKC-privacy model over the traditional K-anonymity model, we measure the discernibility ratio, denoted DR T radK , on traditional Kanonymous solutions produced by the TDR method in [8]. DR T radK \u2212DR, representing the benefit of our model, spans from 0.1 to 0.45.

Figure 5c depicts the discernibility ratio DR with adversary's knowledge L = 2, 4, 6, anonymity threshold 20 \u2264 K \u2264 100, and confidence threshold C = 20%. DR sometimes has a drop when K increases. This is due to the fact that our greedy algorithm identifies only the sub-optimal solution. DR is insensitive to the increase of K and stays close to 0 for L = 2. As L increases to 4, DR increases significantly and finally equals traditional K-anonymity when L = 6 because the number of attributes in Adult is relatively smaller than in Blood. Yet, K-anonymity does not prevent attribute linkages, while our LKC-privacy provides this additional privacy guarantee.\nFigure 5d depicts the DR with adversary's knowledge L = 2, 4, 6, confidence threshold 5% \u2264 C \u2264 30%, and anonymity threshold K = 100.

Motivated by the BTS' privacy and information requirements, we formulated the LKC-privacy model for high-dimensional relational data. Moreover, our developed algorithm can accommodate two different information requirements according to the BTS' information need. Our proposed solution is different from privacy-preserving data mining (PPDM) due to the fact that we allow data sharing instead of data mining result sharing. This is an essential requirement for the BTS since they require the flexibility to perform various data analysis tasks. We believe that our proposed solution could serve as a model for data sharing in the healthcare sector.\nFinally, we would like to share our collaborative experience with the healthcare sector. Health data are complex, often a combination of relational data, transaction data, and textual data. So far, our project focuses only on the relational data, but we notice that some recent works, e.g., [9][10] [21][27], are applicable to solve the privacy problem on transaction and textual data in the BTS case. Besides the technical issue, it is equally important to educate health institute management and medical practitioners about the latest privacy-preserving technology. When management encounters the problem of privacy-aware information sharing as presented in this paper, their initial response is often to set up a traditional role-based secure access model. In fact, alternative techniques, such as privacypreserving data mining and data publishing [2][7], are available to them provided that the data mining quality does not significantly degrade.", "publication_ref": ["b8"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "", "text": "The research is supported in part by Discovery Grants (356065-2008) and Canada Graduate Scholarship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}], "references": [{"ref_id": "b0", "title": "On k-anonymity and the curse of dimensionality", "journal": "", "year": "2005", "authors": "C C Aggarwal"}, {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Privacy Preserving Data Mining: Models and Algorithms", "journal": "Springer", "year": "2008", "authors": "C C Aggarwal; P S Yu"}, {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Privacy preserving data mining", "journal": "", "year": "2000", "authors": "R Agrawal; R Srikant"}, {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Data privacy through optimal k-anonymization", "journal": "", "year": "2005", "authors": "R J Bayardo; R "}, {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "California inpatient data reporting manual, medical information reporting for california", "journal": "", "year": "2007-07", "authors": "D M Carlisle; M L Rodrian; C L Diamond"}, {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Differential privacy: A survey of results.
