However, for people experiencing mental health challenges, such thoughts are often entrenched, automatic and emotionally triggering, making it difficult to overcome them in-themoment (Beck, 1976). An evidence-based, wellestablished therapeutic intervention to overcome negative thoughts is Cognitive Reframing, in which a negative thought is replaced with a more hopeful \"reframed thought,\" which offers an alternative perspective on one's situation (Beck, 1976). For example, imagine a person with a situation \"I'm submitting a research paper to ACL 2023\" has a thought \"This paper is going to get rejected.\" A possible way to reframe this thought is to say \"This paper has some chance of getting accepted due to its novel methodology and potential impact.\"\nPsychotherapy research suggests that for a reframed thought to be effective, it must be (a) relatable to the individual, (b) helpful in overcoming the negative thought and (c) memorable to be accessible the next time a similar thought arises (Beck, 1976;Burns, 1980). However, understanding what characterizes a relatable, helpful and memorable reframe is challenging and unknown. Professional therapists can support people in coming up with such highly effective reframed thoughts. However, barriers like clinician shortages, lack of insurance coverage and stigma commonly limit access to therapists (Olfson, 2016;Sickel et al., 2014). NLPbased methods that assist individuals in reframing negative thoughts, in-the-moment, may provide scaffolding that is easier to engage with and that could be made widely accessible.\nPrior NLP research has developed methods for a range of text reframing tasks like sentiment and empathy rewriting (Reif et al., 2022;Sharma et al., 2021) and more recently, positive reframing (Ziems et al., 2022). However, little is known about how to develop cognitive reframing methods that automatically generate relatable, helpful and memorable reframed thoughts.\nIn this paper, we conduct a study of how language models can be used to reframe negative thoughts (Figure 1). We study ways in which a negative thought can be reframed, how LMs can be utilized to perform this reframing and what types of reframes are preferred by people who experience negative thoughts.\nFirst, in collaboration with clinical psycholo- Here, we propose a framework of seven reframing attributes (see gray box). Given a reframed thought, we control each attribute (e.g., actionability) to generate reframes that score higher or lower on that attribute (e.g., more or less actionable); (c) We deploy this model on Mental Health America, a large U.S. national mental health website (bit.ly/changing-thoughts) and conduct a randomized field study with 2,067 participants. We suggest LM-generated reframes to MHA visitors and assess which reframing attributes are desirable and what constitutes a relatable, helpful and memorable reframe.\ngists and mental health professionals, we develop a new conceptual framework for characterizing the ways in which a thought might be reframed. We synthesize the most prominent cognitive reframing processes used in therapy and define seven linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts: whether the reframe addresses \"thinking traps\" (faulty or distorted patterns of thinking), whether it is rational, positive, empathic, actionable, specific and readable. Building on prior research, we develop automated metrics to measure these attributes and establish construct validity by correlating them with judgements from mental health practitioners. Next, to develop models for the cognitive reframing task, we collect and share 1 a dataset from mental health practitioners and clinical psychology graduate students. The dataset includes 600 situations and thoughts with expert-suggested reframes as well as annotations of the proposed reframing attributes. Using this dataset, we develop a retrievalenhanced in-context learning method (Brown et al., 2020) to generate reframed thoughts and to control their linguistic attributes. We show that this method achieves the highest overlap with expert-suggested reframes and the highest relatability and helpfulness ratings based on evaluation from mental health 1 Our code and datasets are available at github.com/behavioral-data/Cognitive-Reframing.\nexperts, when compared to popular NLP baselines.\nWe investigate which reframing attributes are desirable and what constitutes a relatable, helpful and memorable reframe. In collaboration (and coauthorship) with mental health experts, and after appropriate ethical review, we deploy a month-long randomized field study on Mental Health America (MHA; a popular website that shares mental health resources and tools online), with 2,067 participants with informed consent. We ask MHA visitors to describe situations and negative thoughts they are experiencing and then suggest LM-generated reframed thoughts with varying linguistic attributes. We find that highly specific and highly empathic reframing is the most preferred and highly specific and actionable reframing is considered the most helpful and memorable. However, we find that reframes that are highly positive are less preferred. These findings provide key implications for cognitive reframing of negative thoughts and for the use of Human-LM interaction in this process.", "publication_ref": ["b3", "b3", "b3", "b9", "b35", "b54", "b43", "b48", "b66"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Problem Definition and Goals", "text": "We work on the task of Cognitive Reframing. Given a situation S i and a negative thought T i , the task is to generate a reframed thought R i .\nPsychotherapy literature (Beck, 1976) highlights three desirable outcomes for a successful reframe:\n(a) the reframed thought must be relatable to the individual, (b) it must help them overcome the negative thought and (c) it must be memorable the next time a similar negative thinking pattern emerges.\nHere, we aim to understand what constitutes successful reframing and how language models can assist people in this process. Towards this goal, we characterize the linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts ( \u00a73), collect a dataset of situations, thoughts and reframes ( \u00a74), develop methods to generate reframes and to measure and control their attributes ( \u00a75; \u00a76) and investigate which linguistic attributes are related to the reframing outcomes of relatability, helpfulness and memorability ( \u00a77).", "publication_ref": ["b3"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Framework of Linguistic Attributes of Reframed Thoughts", "text": "We draw from clinical therapy practices and collaborate with mental health experts (some of whom are co-authors) to develop a framework of linguistic attributes of reframed thoughts. We illustrate these attributes with the following example for all reframes below -Situation: \"I submitted a research paper and it got rejected;\" Thought: \"I'll never succeed as a researcher.\"\nAddressing Thinking Traps. Negative thinking often falls into common patterns, called \"thinking traps.\" Also called cognitive distortions, these include exaggerated and biased patterns of thinking which cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately (Beck, 1976;Ding et al., 2022). Common thinking traps include: assuming what others think (\"Mind reading\"), thinking in extremes (\"Allor-nothing thinking\"), focusing on the worst-case scenario (\"Catastrophizing\"), trying to predict the future (\"Fortune telling\"), etc. See Appendix D for the full list.\nA reframe may or may not directly address one or more of the thought's thinking traps. A reframe like \"I don't know what the future will bring\" directly addresses the thinking trap \"Fortune telling,\" whereas a reframe like \"I will surely become a successful researcher\" does not address this thinking trap but rather continues to express it.\nRationality. Another strategy to reframe a thought is to reflect on evidence for and against it and reason about what these evidence imply (Beck, 1976). For example, the rejection of the paper is evidence of having the thought \"I'll never succeed as a researcher.\" However, the evidence against this thought could be that acceptance or rejection of one paper does not make someone a failure, which may lead to a reframe \"Just getting one paper rejected doesn't define my failure.\" A rational reframe is guided by such strong evidence whereas an irrational reframe is based on unrealistic assumptions.\nPositivity. A reframe of a negative thought tries to emphasize the positive perspectives of the situation but different reframes may have different levels of positivity. An overly positive reframe like \"I'm going to win best paper awards for every paper from now on\" exaggerates the positive perspectives, which is likely to set the person up for disappointment rather than success (Dember and Penwell, 1980). On the other hand, a balanced response like \"I may or may not succeed, but I'll keep trying\" considers both positive and negative perspectives of the situation.\nEmpathy. It can be helpful to acknowledge the feelings caused by negative thoughts (Allen and Leary, 2010;Elliott et al., 2011). A reframe may express empathy or self-compassion by validating how one is feeling. E.g., \"It is okay to feel disappointed when a paper gets rejected.\" Actionability. To encourage pleasant emotions, one commonly used therapeutic approach is Behavioral Activation (Dimidjian et al., 2011;Burkhardt et al., 2021). This involves engaging in behaviors or actions that may help in overcoming negative thoughts. A reframe may suggest specific actions (e.g., \"I can take the feedback I received and use it to improve my paper\"), may not suggest specific actions but be actionable (e.g., \"I can use this experience to learn and grow\") or may not be actionable at all (e.g., \"I may or may not become a successful researcher\").", "publication_ref": ["b3", "b15", "b3", "b13", "b0", "b16", "b14", "b8"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Specificity.", "text": "A reframe may specifically address the situation and the thought (e.g., \"One paper rejection doesn't define my failure as a researcher\") or may be generic enough to be applicable to a wide range of negative situations and thoughts (e.g., \"I'm going to succeed\"). While a specific reframe may be more helpful in-the-moment, a generic reframe could be effective for recurring thoughts, which are frequently a result of the \"core\" beliefs that a person holds (Beck, 2005;David et al., 2009). Readability. The linguistic reasoning capabilities of individuals may be different (e.g., across age groups or education levels) (Kaplan et al., 1995). Accordingly, a reframe may either be simple or complex to read (e.g., \"I'll do well in the future\" vs. \"I'm resolute in my ambition to succeed\").", "publication_ref": ["b4", "b12", "b21"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Data Collection", "text": "To facilitate computational methods for cognitive reframing, we collect a dataset of reframed thoughts, annotated with their linguistic attributes.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Curated Situations & Negative Thoughts", "text": "We start by curating data sources for situations and negative thoughts.\nThought Records Dataset (Burger et al., 2021).

Given a situation S i , a negative thought T i and a reframed thought R i , our goal is to identify the set of thinking traps addressed by the reframed thought. We approach this as a multi-label classification task, and fine-tune a GPT-3 model 3 on the expert-annotated thinking trap labels collected in \u00a74.2.\nRationality. Rationality is the quality of being guided by reasons (Damielson et al., 2004). Here, we operationalize rationality of a reframed thought R i as its reasoning strength and ask the following two questions: (1) What might be the reasoning behind R i ?;\n(2) Are the reasons sound? To understand the reasoning behind R i , we develop an abductive explanation based method (Peirce, 1974;Bhagavatula et al., 2020;Jung et al., 2022). For a given (S i , T i ), we use a language model to generate (a) the most plausible explanations that support R i and (b) the most plausible explanations that refute it. Moreover, to check if the explanations are sound, we recursively generate explanations behind the explanations to test their reasoning strength (Appendix E). Let sup(\u22c5) be a generator function that generates explanation supporting a reframe and let ref (\u22c5) be a generator function that generates explanation refuting a reframe. Then, we recursively define reasoning strength RS(S i , T i , R i ) as\n(P(R i = sound|S i , T i ) \u00d7 E r\u223csup(\u22c5) [RS (S i , T i , r)]) \u2212 (P(R i = flawed|S i , T i ) \u00d7 E r\u223cref (\u22c5) [RS (S i , T i , r)])\nTo design the explanation generator functions, sup(\u22c5) and ref (\u22c5), we leverage in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020). In collaboration with mental health experts, we design 10 demonstration examples of situations, thoughts and reframed thoughts with explanations that support (\"This reframed thought is sound because...\") and refute (\"This reframed thought is flawed because...\") a particular reframe. We use these examples to prompt GPT-3. Moreover, to estimate the probabilities P(R i = sound) and P(R i = flawed), we use the token probability of generating \"sound\" and \"flawed\" respectively, given S i , T i , R i and the text \"This reframed thought is\" as input to  Positivity. To measure the positivity of the generated reframed thought, we use a RoBERTa-based sentiment classifier fine-tuned on the TweetEval benchmark (Barbieri et al., 2020).\nEmpathy. To measure empathy, we build upon the empathy classification model presented in Sharma et al. (2020b). This RoBERTa-based model leverages a theoretically-grounded framework of empathy consisting of three empathy communication mechanisms (emotional reactions, interpretations and explorations) and predicts empathy levels in mental health conversations on a scale from 0 to 6. Here, we further fine-tune this model on the domain of reframed thoughts through a manually labeled dataset of 300 reframed thoughts with empathy labels (labeled by one author with expertise in empathy in mental health context).\nActionability. To measure actionability, we hypothesize that an actionable reframe is one that either (1) suggests a concrete action or (2) does not suggest a concrete action but is easy to act upon. We cast action concreteness as a binary classification task: given reframe R i , predict contains_action(R i ) \u2208 {0, 1}. We make fewshot predictions by prompting GPT-3 with 10 examples of reframed thoughts paired with actionability ratings from \u00a74.2 (details in Appendix A.1).\nTo determine the ease with which R i can be acted upon, we examine the next set of actions entailed by R i . Our hypothesis is that a diverse next action set may indicate ambiguity which might be less actionable, whereas a coherent next action set may indicate clarity which might be more actionable. Here, we instruct GPT-3 to generate k = 5 next action candidates given a reframed thought (instruction prompting; zeroshot). We compute the next action coherencedenoted next_action_coherence(R i ) -by embedding each of the k action candidates using RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and computing the average pairwise cosine similarity. Higher similarity indicates greater coherence among the possible next actions. Our overall actionability measurement is defined as contains_action(R i ) + next_action_coherence(R i ). Specificity. Following prior work (Xu et al., 2018;Sharma et al., 2021), we measure specificity using sentence embedding similarity between the reframed thought R i and the concatenation of the situation S i and the thought T i (using RoBERTa embeddings (Liu et al., 2019)).\nReadability. We employ the commonly used Coleman-Liau Index (CLI) metric (Coleman and Liau, 1975) which assesses readability based on the character and word structure within a sentence. The Coleman-Liau Index is calculated as 0.0588L \u2212 0.296S \u2212 15.8, where L: average number of letters per 100 words; S is the average number of sentences per 100 words.", "publication_ref": ["b11", "b37", "b5", "b20", "b2", "b50", "b29", "b60", "b48", "b29", "b10"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Reframe Generation", "text": "In-context learning methods can learn to generalize NLP tasks from a handful of examples (few-shot learning) or from hand-written instructions alone (instruction prompting) (Brown et al., 2020).

For each situation S i and negative thought T i , we retrieve k-similar examples from our dataset ( \u00a74). We first encode situations and thoughts using RoBERTa embeddings. Then, we retrieve k examples, {(s 1 , t 1 ), ..., (s k , t k )},  from our dataset based on the top-k values of cosine_sim(concat(s, t), concat(S i , T i )).

Here, we generate two reframes R i (tt,Y) and R i (tt,N) , one that addresses the thinking traps in T i and another that does not address it. 5 We extract two separate sets of in-context examples from our dataset -those that address at least one thinking trap and those that do not (as collected in \u00a74). We use those examples to prompt GPT-3 to generate R i (tt,Y) and R i (tt,N) .\nMoreover, a reframed thought may have high or low rationality, positivity, empathy, actionability, specificity and readability values. For these six attributes, given a reframe R i and a linguistic attribute a, we generate two additional reframes R i (a,H) and R i (a,L) , one that scores higher on attribute a and another that scores lower on it (e.g., higher or lower actionability).

Computational work on cognitive reframing has relied on smallscale crowdsourcing studies (Smith et al., 2021;Morris et al., 2015). Our work develops scalable methods for cognitive reframing and conducts a randomized field study on a large mental health platform. Prior text reframing research has developed methods for related tasks including style, sentiment, politeness and empathy transfer (Reif et al., 2022;Madaan et al., 2020;Sharma et al., 2021) as well as positive reframing (Ziems et al., 2022).

There is a possibility that, in attempting to assist, AI may have the opposite effect on people struggling with mental health challenges. Here, in active collaboration and consultation with mental health professionals and clinical psychologists, we took several measures to minimize these risks.\nIRB Approval. We obtained approval from the University of Washington's Institutional Review Board for both our data collection (IRB ID STUDY00015882) as well as the randomized field study (IRB ID STUDY00016783). Our organization requires all research personnel who conduct human subjects research to complete human subjects protection training using the online CITI course. The graduate students conducting these studies were certified by our IRB.\nInformed Consent from Participants. We obtained informed consent from all participants in our randomized field study (Appendix H). All participants were 18 years of age and older. Participants were informed that they will be interacting with an AI-based model that automatically generates reframed thoughts and is not monitored by a human. Also, they were informed about the possibility that some of the generated content may be upsetting or disturbing.\nCrisis Resources. We made it very explicit that the model should not be used as a \"cry for help\" outlet and should not be used in cases of suicidal ideation and self-harm. Also, we provided two crisis resources -Crisis Text Line (crisistextline.org) and 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (988lifeline.org)to our participants at the start of the study.\nSafety Measures. To minimize harmful LMgenerated reframings, we filtered out any response that contained suicidal ideation or self-harm-related words or phrases. For this, we created a list of 50 regular expressions (e.g., to identify phrases like \"feeling suicidal\", \"wish to die\", \"harm myself \") using suicidal risk assessment lexicons such as Gaur et al. (2019). An LM-generated response that matched any of the regular expressions was filtered out and not shown to the participants. Also, participants were given an option to flag inappropriate reframing suggestions through a \"Flag inappropriate\" button (Appendix C).\nPrivacy. We did not collect any privately identifiable information in our randomized field study and removed any user identifiers before conducting our data analysis. All research data was stored within a separate secure computing environment and only trained research personnel were provided access to data. The situations and thoughts collected in \u00a74.1 went through an anonymization process, where we manually removed any user identifiers and replaced any specific identifiable information including locations, names, etc. with their more general version, following Matthews et al. (2017).", "publication_ref": ["b17", "b31"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Limitations", "text": "We conducted our randomized field study on a single platform (Mental Health America) and in a single language (English). However, MHA is a particularly popular source for mental health resources with over ten million yearly visitors.\nIn addition, we note that a range of socio-cultural factors might influence how negative thoughts should be reframed and how LMs assisting this process should be developed. Conducting studies on specific communities, including underrepresented communities and minorities, was beyond the scope of this research. Ensuring equitable access of these tools and adapting them to various socio-cultural contexts requires further investigation.\nNot all cognitive reframing implementations elicit situations, but we believed it was essential for making the reframe personally relatable. In the future, when an individual uses the system for multiple situations and thoughts, it would be interesting to study how their context can be learned more effectively over time. Due to privacy concerns, we presently do not gather information to link multiple sessions. However, with appropriate ethical considerations and user consent, this approach may be beneficial.\nOur focus in this paper was primarily on creating an intervention that is effective in-the-moment. This was motivated by recent clinical psychology research that suggests that such single-session, inthe-moment interventions can lead to significant positive long-term mental health outcomes (Schleider et al., 2022). To integrate a partial longer-term perspective, we assessed the memorability of a reframe, which may be essential for future utility. Nevertheless, evaluating long-term outcomes is critical and forms an important future research direction.

Using the reframed thoughts that were annotated as high or low actionable in our collected data ( \u00a74.2), we manually create 10 demonstration examples. If a reframed thought contains an action, we ask GPT-3 to extract the action from it. Otherwise, we ask it to generate the text \"No Action\". Appendix A.2 shows examples.

If GPT-3 predicts an action for R i , we assign contains_action(R i ) = 1; else we assign 0.\nFor next_action_coherence(R i ), we instruct GPT-3 to generate k = 5 possible next actions given a reframed thought.
