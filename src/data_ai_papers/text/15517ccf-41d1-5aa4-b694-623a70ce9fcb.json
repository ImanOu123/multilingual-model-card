These include high dynamic range, multispectral, omnidirectional, and multiviewpoint imaging systems. The hardware and software of each of these devices are designed to accomplish a particular imaging function and this function cannot be altered without significant redesign.\nIn this paper, we introduce the notion of a programmable imaging system. Such a system gives a human user or a computer vision system significant control over the radiometric and geometric properties of the system. This flexibility is achieved by using a programmable array of micro-mirrors. The orientations of the mirrors of the array can be controlled with very high speed. This enables the system to select and modulate scene rays based on the needs of the application at hand. The end result is a single imaging system that can emulate the functionalities of several existing specialized systems as well as new ones.\nFigure 1: The principle underlying programmable imaging using a micro-mirror array. If the orientations of the individual mirrors can be controlled with high precision and speed, scene rays can be selected and modulated in a variety of ways, each leading to a different imaging system.\nThe basic principle behind the proposed approach is illustrated in Figure 1. The system observes the scene via a two-dimensional array of micro-mirrors, whose orientations can be controlled. The surface normal n i of the i th mirror determines the direction of the scene ray it reflects into the imaging system. If the normals of the mirrors can be arbitrarily chosen, each mirror can be programmed to select from a continuous cone of scene rays. In addition, each mirror can also be oriented with normal n b such that it reflects a black surface (with zero radiance). Let the integration time of the image detector be T . If the mirror is made to point in the directions n i and n b for durations t and T \u2212 t, respectively, the scene ray is attenuated by t/T . As a result, each imaged scene ray can also be radiometrically modulated with high precision.\nSince the micro-mirror array is programmable, the above geometric and radiometric manipulations can be varied to create a wide range of transformations of the light field of the scene to captured images. We will show that the radiometric modulation enables us to achieve several functions including high dynamic range imaging, optical feature detection, and object recognition using appearance matching. In addition, we show how the orientations of the mirrors can be programmed to control the field of view and resolution of an imaging system.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Imaging with a Micromirror Device", "text": "Ideally, we would like to have full control over the orientations of our micro-mirrors. Such devices are being developed for adaptive optical processing in astronomy Figure 2: Our implementation of programmable imaging uses a digital micro-mirror device (DMD). Each mirror of the device is roughly 14 \u00d7 14 microns and can be oriented with high precision and speed at +10 or \u221210 degrees. [20]. However, at this point in time, they do not have the physical properties and programmability that we need for our purpose. To implement our ideas, we use the digital micro-mirror device (DMD) that was introduced in the 1980s by Hornbeck at Texas Instruments [7], [8]. The DMD is a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) that has evolved rapidly over the last decade and has found many applications [3]. It is the key enabling technology in many of today's projection systems [9]. The latest generation of DMDs have more than a million mirrors, each mirror roughly 14 \u00d7 14 microns in size (see Figure 2). From our perspective, the main limitation of current DMDs is that the mirrors can only be oriented in one of two directions; \u221210 \u2022 or +10 \u2022 about one of the mirror's diagonal axes (see Figure 2). However, the orientation of the mirror can be switched from one state to the other in a few microseconds, enabling modulation of incident light with very high precision.\nFigure 3 shows the optical layout of the system we have developed using the DMD. The scene is first projected onto the DMD plane using an imaging lens. This means that the cone of light from each scene point received by the aperture of the imaging lens is focused onto a single micro-mirror. When all the mirrors are oriented at +10 \u2022 , the light cones are reflected in the direction of a re-imaging lens which focuses the image received by the DMD onto a CCD image detector. Note that the DMD in this case behaves like a planar scene that is tilted by 20 \u2022 with respect to the optical axis of the reimaging lens. To produce a focused image of this tilted set of source points, one needs to tilt the image detector according to the well-known Scheimpflug condition [18].", "publication_ref": ["b20", "b7", "b8", "b2", "b9", "b18"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Prototype System", "text": "It is only recently that developer kits have begun to appear that enable one to use DMDs in different applications. When we began implementing our system this option was not available. Hence, we chose to re-engineer an off-the-shelf DMD projector into an imaging system by reversing the path of light; the projector lens is used to form an image of the scene on the DMD rather than illuminate the scene via the DMD. Figure 4(a) shows a partly disassembled Infocus LP 400 projector. This projector uses one of the early versions of the DMD with 800 \u00d7 600 mirrors, each 17 \u00d7 17 microns in size. The modulation function of the DMD is controlled by simply applying an 8-bit image (VGA signal) to the projector input. We had to make significant hardware changes to the projector. First, the projector lamp had to be blocked out of the optical path. Then, the chassis had to be modified so that the re-imaging lens and the camera could be attached to the system. The final system is shown in Figure 4(b). The CCD camera used is an 8-bit monochrome Sony XC-75 model with 640 \u00d7 480 pixels. The processing of the camera image and the control of DMD image is done using a Dell workstation with a 2.5 GHz Pentium 4 processor.\nDMDs have previously been used in imaging applications, but for very specific tasks such as recording celestial objects in astronomy. For instance, in [12] the DMD is used to mask out bright sources of light (like the sun) so that dimmer regions (the corona of the sun) can be imaged with higher dynamic range. In [11], a DMD is used to mask out everything except a small number of stars. Light from these unmasked stars are directed towards a spectroscope to measure the spectral characteristics of the stars. In [2] and [1], the DMD is used to modulate brightness values at a pixel level for high dynamic range multispectral imaging and removal of image blooming, respectively. These works address rather specific imaging needs. In contrast, we are interested in a flexible imaging system that can perform a wide range of functions.\nAn extensive off-line calibration of the geometric and radiometric properties of the system was conducted (see [15] for details). The geometric calibration involves determining the mapping between DMD and CCD pixels. This mapping is critical to controlling the DMD and interpreting the images captured by the CCD. The with uniform brightness. Then, a large number of square patches were used as input to the DMD and recorded using the CCD, as shown in Figure 5. In order to scan the entire set of patches efficiently, binary coding of the patches was done. The centroids of corresponding patches in the DMD and CCD images were fit to a piecewise, first-order polynomial. The computed mapping was found to have an RMS error of 0.6 (CCD) pixels.\nFigure 6 shows two simple examples that illustrate the modulation of scene images using the DMD. One can see that after modulation some of the scene regions that were previously saturated produce useful brightness values. Note that the captured CCD image is skewed with respect to the DMD modulation image. This skewing is due to the required tilt of the CCD discussed above and can be undone using the calibration result. In our system, the modulation image can be controlled with 8 bits of precisions and the captured CCD images have 8 bits of accuracy. Hence, the measurements made at each pixel have roughly 16 bits of information.

In this section, we will describe three different implementations of high dynamic range imaging using the programmable imaging system.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Temporal Exposure Variation", "text": "We begin with the simplest implementation, where the global exposure of the scene is varied as a function of time. In this case, the control image applied to the DMD is spatially constant but changes periodically with time. An example of a video sequence acquired in this manner is shown in Figure 7, where 4 modulation levels are cycled over time. It has been shown in previous work that an image sequence acquired in this manner can be used to compute high dynamic range video when the motions of scene points between subsequent frames is small [4] [10]. Alternatively, the captured video can be subsampled in time to produce multiple video streams with lower frame-rate, each with a different fixed exposure. Such data can improve the robustness of tasks such as face recognition, where a face missed at one exposure may be better visible and hence detected at another exposure. Videos of the type shown in Figure 7 can also be obtained by changing the integration time of the detector or the gain of the camera. Due to the various forms of camera noise, changing integration time or gain compromises the quality of the acquired data. In our case, since the DMD can be controlled with 8 bits of accuracy and the CCD camera produces 8-bit images, the captured sequence can be controlled with 16 bits of precision.", "publication_ref": ["b3", "b10"], "figure_ref": ["fig_4", "fig_4"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Spatio-Temporal Exposure Variation", "text": "In [16], the concept of spatially varying pixel exposures was proposed, where an image is acquired with a detector with a mosaic of neutral density filters. The captured image can be reconstructed to obtain a high dynamic range image with a slight loss in spatial resolution. Our programmable system allows us to capture an image with spatially varying exposures by simply applying a fixed (checkerboard-like) pattern to the DMD. In [17], it was shown that a variety of exposure patterns can be used, each trading-off dynamic range and spatial resolution in different ways. Such trade-offs are easy to explore using our system.\nIt turns out that spatially varying exposures can also be used to generate video streams that have higher dynamic range for a human observer, without post-processing each acquired image as was done in [16]. If one uses a fixed pattern, the pattern will produce a very visible modulation that would be distracting to the observer. However, if the pattern is varied with time, the eye becomes less sensitive to the pattern and a video with a larger range of brightnesses is perceived by the observer. Figure 8(a) shows the image of a scene taken without modulation. It is clear that the scene has a wide dynamic range and an 8-bit camera cannot capture this range. Figure 8(b) shows four consecutive frames captured with spatially varying exposures. The exposure pattern uses 4 different exposures (e 1 , e 2 , e 3 , e 4 ) within each 2 \u00d7 2 neighborhood of pixels. The relative positions of the 4 exposures are changed over time using a cyclic permutation. In the images shown in Figure 8(b), one sees the spatial patterns introduced by the exposures (see insets). However, when this sequence is viewed at 30 Hz, the pattern is more or less invisible (the eye integrates over the changes) and a wider range of brightnesses are visible.  ", "publication_ref": ["b16", "b17", "b16"], "figure_ref": ["fig_5", "fig_5", "fig_5"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Adaptive Dynamic Range", "text": "Recently, the method of adaptive dynamic range was introduced in [14], where the exposure of each pixel is controlled based on the scene radiance measured at the pixel. A prototype device was implemented using an LCD attenuator attached to the front of the imaging lens of a camera. This implementation suffers from three limitations. First, since the LCD attenuator uses polarization filters, it allows only 50% of the light from the scene to enter the imaging system even when the attenuation is set to zero. Second, the attenuation function is optically defocused by the imaging system and hence pixel-level attenuation could not be achieved. Finally, the LCD attenuator cells produce diffraction effects that cause the captured images to be slightly blurred.\nThe DMD-based system enables us to implement adaptive dynamic range imaging without any of the above limitations. Since the image of the scene is first focused on the DMD and then re-imaged onto the image detector, we are able to achieve pixel-level control. In addition, the fill-factor of the DMD is very high compared to an LCD array and hence the optical efficiency of the modulation is closer to 90%. Because of the high fillfactor, the blurring/diffraction effects are minimal. In [2] and [1], a DMD has been used to address this problem, but these previous works do not adequately address the real-time spatio-temporal control issues that arise in the case of dynamic scenes. We have implemented a con-trol algorithm very similar to that described in [14] for computing the DMD modulation function based on each captured image. Results from this system are shown in Figure 9. The first row shows a person under harsh lighting imaged without modulation (conventional camera). The second row shows the output of the camera and the third row shows the corresponding modulation (attenuation) images applied to the DMD. As described in [14], the modulation image and the acquired image can be used to compute a video stream that has an effective dynamic range of 16 bits.", "publication_ref": ["b14", "b1", "b0", "b14", "b14"], "figure_ref": ["fig_6"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Intra-Pixel Optical Feature Detection", "text": "The field of optical computing has developed very efficient and powerful ways to apply image processing algorithms (such as convolution and correlation) [5]. A major disadvantage of optical computing is that it requires the use of coherent light to represent the images. This has proven cumbersome, bulky, and expensive. It turns out that programmable modulation can be used to implement a special class of image processing tasks directly to the incoherent optical image captured by the imaging lens, without the use of any coherent sources. In particular, one can apply convolution at an intra-pixel level very efficiently. By intra-pixel we mean that the convolution mask is being applied to the distribution of light energy within a single pixel rather than a neighborhood of pixels. Intra-pixel optical processing leads to very efficient algorithms for finding features such as edges, lines, and corners.\nConsider the convolution f * g of a continuous optical image f with a kernel g whose span (width) is less than, or equal to, a pixel on the image detector. We can rewrite the convolution as f * (g + \u2212 g \u2212 ) where g + is made up of only the positive elements of g and g \u2212 has only the absolute of the negative elements of g. We use this decomposition since incoherent light cannot be negatively modulated (the modulation image cannot have negative values). An example of such a decomposition for the case of a first-derivative operator is shown in Figure 10(a). As shown in the figure, let each CCD pixel correspond to 3\u00d73 DMD pixels; i.e. the DMD has three times the linear resolution of the CCD. Then, the two components of the convolution (due to g + and g \u2212 ) are directly obtained by capturing two images with the modulation images shown in Figure 10(b). The difference between these images gives the final result (f * g).\nFigure 10(c) shows the four optically processed images of a scene obtained for the case of the Sobel edge operator. The computed edge map is shown in Figure 10(d). Since our DMD has only 800\u00d7600 elements, the edge map is of lower resolution with about 200 \u00d7 150 pixels. Although four images are needed in this case, it can be applied to a scene with slowly moving objects where each new image is only used to update one of the four component filter outputs in the edge computation. Note that all the multiplications involved in the convolutions are done in optical domain (at the speed of light).", "publication_ref": ["b4"], "figure_ref": ["fig_7", "fig_7", "fig_7", "fig_7"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Optical Appearance Matching", "text": "In the past decade, appearance matching using subspace methods has become a popular approach to object recognition [19][13]. Most of these algorithms are based on projecting input images to a precomputed linear subspace and then finding the closest database point that lies in the subspace. The projection of an input image requires finding its dot product with a number of vectors. In the case of principal component analysis, the vectors are the eigenvectors of a correlation or covariance matrix computed using images in the training set.\nIt turns out that optical modulation can be used to perform all the required multiplications in optical domain, leaving only additions to be done computationally. Let the input image be m and the eigenvectors of the subspace be e 1 , e 2 , ...e k . The eigenvectors are concatenated to obtain a larger (tiled) vector B = [e 1 , e 2 , ...e k ] and k copies of the input image are concatenated to obtained the (tiled) vector A = [m, m, ......m]. If the vector A is \"shown\" as the scene to our imaging system and the vector B is used as the modulation image, the image captured by the camera is a vector C = A. * B, where . * denotes an element-by-element product of the two vectors. Then, the image C is raster scanned to sum up its k tiles to obtain the k coefficients that correspond to the subspace projection of the input image. This coefficient vector is compared with stored vectors and the closest match reveals the identity of the object in the image.   We have used our programmable system to implement this idea and develop a real-time face recognition system. Figure 11(a) shows the 6 people in our database; 30 poses (images) of each person were captured to obtain a total of 180 training images. PCA was applied and the 6 most prominent eigenvectors are tiled as shown in Figure 11(b) and used as the DMD modulation image. During recognition, the output of the video camera is also tiled in the same way as the eigenvectors and displayed on a screen that sits in front of the imaging system, as shown in Figure 11(c). The 6 parts of the captured image are summed to obtain the 6 coefficients. A simple nearest-neighbor algorithm is applied to these coefficients to recognize the person in the input image.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_9", "fig_9", "fig_9"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Programmable Field of View", "text": "Thus far, we have mainly exploited the radiometric flexibility made possible by our imaging system. The use of a programmable micro-mirror array also allows us to very quickly alter the field of view and resolution characteristics of an imaging system 1 . Quite simply, a planar array of mirrors can be used to emulate a deformable mirror whose shape can be changed almost instantaneously.\nTo illustrate this idea, we do not use the imaging system in Figure 4 as the imaging optics would have to be substantially altered to facilitate field of view manipulation. Instead, we consider the case where the micro-mirror array does not have an imaging lens that focuses the scene onto it but instead directly reflects the scene into the camera optics. This scenario is illustrated in Figure 12(a), where the micro-mirror array is aligned with the horizontal axis and the viewpoint of the camera is located at the point P at height h from the array.\nIf all the mirrors are parallel to the horizontal axis, the array behaves like a planar mirror and the viewpoint of the system is simply the reflection P of the point P . The field of view in this case is the solid angle subtended by the mirror array from P . Now consider the micro-mirror located at distance d from the origin to have tilt \u03b8 with the horizontal axis, as shown in Figure 12(a). Then, the angle of the scene ray imaged by this mirror is \u03c6 = 2\u03b8 + \u03b1, where \u03b1 = tan \u22121 (d/h). It is also easy to show that the viewpoint of the system corresponding to this particular mirror element has the (x and y) coordinates Q x (d) = d \u2212 (h 2 + d 2 ) cos \u03b2 and Q y (d) = \u2212 (h 2 + d 2 ) sin \u03b2, where \u03b2 = (\u03c0/2) \u2212 \u03c6. If all the micro-mirrors have the same tilt angle \u03b8, then the system has a locus of viewpoints (caustic) that is a segment of the line that passes through P and Q.\nIf the mirrors of the array can be controlled to have any orientation within a continuous range, one can see that the field of view of the imaging system can be varied over a wide range. For instance, if the mirrors at the two end-points of the array (at \u2212a and b) have orientations \u2212\u03b8 and \u03b8, and the orientations of mirrors in between vary smoothly between these two values, the field of view of the camera is enhance by 4\u03b8. As we mentioned, the DMDs that are currently available can only have one of two mirror orientations (+10 or \u221210 degrees). Therefore, if all the mirrors are initially inactive (0 degrees) and then oriented at 10 degrees, the field of view remains the same but its orientation changes by 20 degrees. This very case is illustrated by the images shown in Figure 12(b), where the left image shows one view of a printed sheet of paper and the right one shows a rotated view of the same.\nOne can see that both the images are blurred. This is be-  cause we are imaging the scene directly through a DMD without using a re-imaging lens and hence many mirrors lie within the light cone that is imaged by a single pixel. Since the mirrors are tilted, the surface discontinuities at the edges of the mirrors cause diffraction effects. These effects can be minimized if one has greater control over the orientations of the micro-mirrors. We expect such devices to become available in the future.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_1", "fig_11", "fig_11", "fig_11"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "Programmable imaging using a micro-mirror array is a general and flexible approach to imaging.
