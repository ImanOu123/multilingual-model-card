In this work, we build a neural network model for the task of ranking clarification questions. Our model is inspired by the idea of expected value of perfect information: a good question is one whose expected answer will be useful. We study this problem using data from StackExchange, a plentiful online resource in which people routinely ask clarifying questions to posts so that they can better offer assistance to the original poster. We create a dataset of clarification questions consisting of \u223c77K posts paired with a clarification question (and answer) from three domains of StackExchange: askubuntu, unix and superuser. We evaluate our model on 500 samples of this dataset against expert human judgments and demonstrate significant improvements over controlled baselines.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "A principle goal of asking questions is to fill information gaps, typically through clarification questions. 1 We take the perspective that a good question is the one whose likely answer will be useful. Consider the exchange in Figure 1, in which an initial poster (who we call \"Terry\") asks for help configuring environment variables. This post is underspecified and a responder (\"Parker\") asks a clarifying question (a) below, but could alternatively have asked (b)   Parker should not ask (b) because an answer is unlikely to be useful; they should not ask (c) because it is too specific and an answer like \"No\" or \"I do not know\" gives little help. Parker's question (a) is much better: it is both likely to be useful, and is plausibly answerable by Terry.\nIn this work, we design a model to rank a candidate set of clarification questions by their usefulness to the given post. We imagine a use case (more discussion in \u00a7 7) in which, while Terry is writing their post, a system suggests a shortlist of questions asking for information that it thinks people like Parker might need to provide a solution, thus enabling Terry to immediately clarify their post, potentially leading to a much quicker resolution. Our model is based on the decision theoretic framework of the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) (Avriel and Williams, 1970), a measure of the value of gathering additional information. In our setting, we use EVPI to calculate which questions are most likely to elicit an answer that would make the post more informative.\nFigure 2: The behavior of our model during test time: Given a post p, we retrieve 10 posts similar to post p using Lucene. The questions asked to those 10 posts are our question candidates Q and the edits made to the posts in response to the questions are our answer candidates A. For each question candidate q i , we generate an answer representation F (p, q i ) and calculate how close is the answer candidate a j to our answer representation F (p, q i ). We then calculate the utility of the post p if it were updated with the answer a j . Finally, we rank the candidate questions Q by their expected utility given the post p (Eq 1).\nOur work has two main contributions: 1. A novel neural-network model for addressing the task of ranking clarification question built on the framework of expected value of perfect information ( \u00a72). 2. A novel dataset, derived from StackExchange 2 , that enables us to learn a model to ask clarifying questions by looking at the types of questions people ask ( \u00a73). We formulate this task as a ranking problem on a set of potential clarification questions. We evaluate models both on the task of returning the original clarification question and also on the task of picking any of the candidate clarification questions marked as good by experts ( \u00a74). We find that our EVPI model outperforms the baseline models when evaluated against expert human annotations. We include a few examples of human annotations along with our model performance on them in the supplementary material. We have released our dataset of \u223c77K (p, q, a) triples and the expert annotations on 500 triples to help facilitate further research in this task. 3", "publication_ref": ["b2"], "figure_ref": ["fig_1"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Model description", "text": "We build a neural network model inspired by the theory of expected value of perfect information (EVPI). EVPI is a measurement of: if I were to acquire information X, how useful would that be to me? However, because we haven't acquired X yet, we have to take this quantity in expectation over all possible X, weighted by each X's likelihood. In our setting, for any given question q i that we can ask, there is a set A of possible answers that could be given. For each possible answer a j \u2208 A, there is some probability of getting that answer, and some utility if that were the answer we got. The value of this question q i is the expected utility, over all possible answers:\nEVPI(q i |p) = a j \u2208A P[a j |p, q i ]U(p + a j ) (1)\nIn Eq 1, p is the post, q i is a potential question from a set of candidate questions Q and a j is a potential answer from a set of candidate answers A.\nHere, P[a j |p, q i ] measures the probability of getting an answer a j given an initial post p and a clarifying question q i , and U(p + a j ) is a utility function that measures how much more complete p would be if it were augmented with answer a j . The modeling question then is how to model:\n1. The probability distribution P[a j |p, q i ] and 2. The utility function U(p + a j ). In our work, we represent both using neural networks over the appropriate inputs. We train the parameters of the two models jointly to minimize a joint loss defined such that an answer that has a higher potential of increasing the utility of a post gets a higher probability.\nFigure 2 describes the behavior of our model during test time. Given a post p, we generate a set of candidate questions and a set of candidate Figure 3: Training of our answer generator. Given a post p i and its question q i , we generate an answer representation that is not only close to its original answer a i , but also close to one of its candidate answers a j if the candidate question q j is close to the original question q i . answers ( \u00a72.1). Given a post p and a question candidate q i , we calculate how likely is this question to be answered using one of our answer candidates a j ( \u00a72.2). Given a post p and an answer candidate a j , we calculate the utility of the updated post i.e. U(p + a j ) ( \u00a72.3).

One way that humans learn to ask questions is by looking at how others ask questions in a similar situation. Using this intuition we generate question candidates for a given post by identifying posts similar to the given post and then looking at the questions asked to those posts. For identifying similar posts, we use Lucene 4 , a software extensively used in information retrieval for extracting documents relevant to a given query from a pool of documents. Lucene implements a variant of the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) model to score the extracted documents according to their relevance to the query. We use Lucene to find the top 10 posts most similar to a given post from our dataset ( \u00a7 3). We consider the questions asked to these 10 posts as our set of question candidates Q and the edits made to the posts in response to the questions as our set of answer candidates A. Since the top-most similar candidate extracted by Lucene is always the original post itself, the original question and answer paired with the post is always one of the candidates in Q and A.\n\u00a73 describes in detail the process of extracting the 4 https://lucene.apache.org/ (post, question, answer) triples from the StackExchange datadump.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Answer modeling", "text": "Given a post p and a question candidate q i , our second step is to calculate how likely is this question to be answered using one of our answer candidates a j . We first generate an answer representation by combining the neural representations of the post and the question using a function F ans (p,q i ) (details in \u00a72.4). Given such a representation, we measure the distance between this answer representation and one of the answer candidates a j using the function below:\ndist(Fans(p,qi),\u00e2j) = 1 \u2212 cos sim(Fans(p,qi),\u00e2j)\nThe likelihood of an answer candidate a j being the answer to a question q i on post p is finally calculated by combining this distance with the cosine similarity between the question q i and the question q j paired with the answer candidate a j :\nP[aj|p, qi] = exp \u2212dist(Fans(p,q i ),\u00e2 j ) * cos sim(qi,qj) (2)\nwhere\u00e2 j ,q i andq j are the average word vector of a j , q i and q j respectively (details in \u00a7 2.4) and cos sim is the cosine similarity between the two input vectors.\nWe model our answer generator using the following intuition: a question can be asked in several different ways. For e.g. in Figure 1, the question \"What version of Ubuntu do you have?\" can be asked in other ways like \"What version of operating system are you using?\", \"Version of OS?\", etc. Additionally, for a given post and a question, there can be several different answers to that question. For instance, \"Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\", \"Ubuntu 12.0\", \"Ubuntu 9.0\", are all valid answers. To generate an answer representation capturing these generalizations, we train our answer generator on our triples dataset ( \u00a73) using the loss function below: lossans(pi, qi, ai, Qi) = dist(Fans(pi,qi),\u00e2i)\n(3)\n+ j\u2208Q dist(Fans(pi,qi),\u00e2j) * cos sim(qi,qj)\nwhere,\u00e2 andq is the average word vectors of a and q respectively (details in \u00a72.4), cos sim is the cosine similarity between the two input vectors. This loss function can be explained using the example in Figure 3. Question q i is the question paired with the given post p i . In Eq 3, the first term forces the function F ans (p i ,q i ) to generate an answer representation as close as possible to the correct answer a i . Now, a question can be asked in several different ways. Let Q i be the set of candidate questions for post p i , retrieved from the dataset using Lucene ( \u00a7 2.1). Suppose a question candidate q j is very similar to the correct question q i ( i.e. cos sim(q i ,q j ) is near zero). Then the second term forces the answer representation F ans (p i ,q i ) to be close to the answer a j corresponding to the question q j as well. Thus in Figure 3, the answer representation will be close to a j (since q j is similar to q i ), but may not be necessarily close to a k (since q k is dissimilar to q i ).", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_1"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Utility calculator", "text": "Given a post p and an answer candidate a j , the third step is to calculate the utility of the updated post i.e. U(p + a j ). As expressed in Eq 1, this utility function measures how useful it would be if a given post p were augmented with an answer a j paired with a different question q j in the candidate set. Although theoretically, the utility of the updated post can be calculated only using the given post (p) and the candidate answer (a j ), empirically we find that our neural EVPI model performs better when the candidate question (q j ) paired with the candidate answer is a part of the utility function. We attribute this to the fact that much information about whether an answer increases the utility of a post is also contained in the question asked to the post. We train our utility calculator using our dataset of (p, q, a) triples ( \u00a73). We label all the (p i , q i , a i ) pairs from our triples dataset with label y = 1. To get negative samples, we make use of the answer candidates generated using Lucene as described in \u00a72.1. For each a j \u2208 A i , where A i is the set of answer candidates for post p i , we label the pair (p i , q j , a j ) with label y = 0, except for when a j = a i . Thus, for each post p i in our triples dataset, we have one positive sample and nine negative samples. It should be noted that this is a noisy labelling scheme since a question not paired with the original question in our dataset can often times be a good question to ask to the post ( \u00a7 4). However, since we do not have annotations for such other good questions at train time, we assume such a labelling.\nGiven a post p i and an answer a j paired with the question q j , we combine their neural representations using a function F util (p i ,q j ,\u0101 j ) (details in \u00a7 2.4). The utility of the updated post is then defined as U(p i + a j ) = \u03c3(F util (p i ,q j ,\u0101 j )) 5 . We want this utility to be close to 1 for all the positively labelled (p, q, a) triples and close to 0 for all the negatively labelled (p, q, a) triples. We therefore define our loss using the binary cross-entropy formulation below:\nloss util (y i ,p i ,q j ,\u0101 j ) = y i log(\u03c3(F util (p i ,q j ,\u0101 j )))(4)", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Our joint neural network model", "text": "Our fundamental representation is based on recurrent neural networks over word embeddings.\nWe obtain the word embeddings using the GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) model trained on the entire datadump of StackExchange. 6 . In Eq 2 and Eq 3, the average word vector representationsq and\u00e2 are obtained by averaging the GloVe word embeddings for all words in the question and the answer respectively. Given an initial post p, we generate a post neural representationp using a post LSTM (long short-term memory architecture) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). The input layer consists of word embeddings of the words in the post which is fed into a single hidden layer.\nThe output of each of the hidden states is averaged together to get our neural representationp. Similarly, given a question q and an answer a, we generate the neural representationsq and\u0101 using a question LSTM and an answer LSTM respectively. We define the function F ans in our answer model as a feedforward neural network with five hidden layers on the inputsp andq. Likewise, we define the function F util in our utility calculator as a feedforward neural network with five hidden layers on the inputsp,q and\u0101. We train the parameters of the three LSTMs corresponding to p, q and a, and the parameters of the two feedforward neural networks jointly to minimize the sum of the loss of our answer model (Eq 3) and our utility calculator (Eq 4) over our entire dataset:\ni j loss ans (p i ,q i ,\u0101 i , Q i ) + loss util (y i ,p i ,q j ,\u0101 j )(5)\nGiven such an estimate P[a j |p, q i ] of an answer and a utility U(p + a j ) of the updated post, we rank the candidate questions by their value as calculated using Eq 1.

However, there are two problems to this approach: 1) Our dataset creation process is noisy. The original question paired with the post may not be a useful question. For e.g. \"are you seriously asking this question?\", \"do you mind making that an answer?\" 9 . 2) The nine other questions in the candidate set are obtained by looking at questions asked to posts that are similar to the given post. 10 This greatly increases the possibility of some other question(s) being more useful than the original question paired with the post.

First, we need it to be able to generalize: for instance by constructing templates of the form \"What version of are you running?\" into which the system would need to fill a variable. Second, in order to move from question ranking to question generation, one could consider sequence-to-sequence based neural network models that have recently proven to be effective for several language generation tasks (Sutskever et al., 2014;Yin et al., 2016). Third is in evaluation: given that this task requires expert human annotations and also given that there are multiple possible good questions to ask, how can we automatically measure performance at this task?, a question faced in dialog and generation more broadly (Paek, 2001;Lowe et al., 2015;Liu et al., 2016).", "publication_ref": ["b4", "b23", "b16", "b0", "b24", "b26", "b17", "b11", "b9"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The authors thank the three anonymous reviewers of this paper, and the anonymous reviewers of the previous versions for their helpful comments and suggestions.
