Probabilistic density models can be used for a wide variety of tasks that range from image compression and forms of reconstruction such as image inpainting (e.g., see Figure 1) and deblurring, to generation of new images. When the model is conditioned on external information, possible applications also include creating images based on text descriptions or simulating future frames in a planning task. One of the great advantages in generative modeling is that there are practically endless amounts of image data available to learn from. However, because images are high dimensional and highly structured, estimating the distribution of natural images is extremely challenging.\nOne of the most important obstacles in generative mod- eling is building complex and expressive models that are also tractable and scalable. This trade-off has resulted in a large variety of generative models, each having their advantages. Most work focuses on stochastic latent variable models such as VAE's (Rezende et al., 2014;Kingma & Welling, 2013) that aim to extract meaningful representations, but often come with an intractable inference step that can hinder their performance.\nOne effective approach to tractably model a joint distribution of the pixels in the image is to cast it as a product of conditional distributions; this approach has been adopted in autoregressive models such as NADE (Larochelle & Murray, 2011) and fully visible neural networks (Neal, 1992;Bengio & Bengio, 2000). The factorization turns the joint modeling problem into a sequence problem, where one learns to predict the next pixel given all the previously generated pixels. But to model the highly nonlinear and longrange correlations between pixels and the complex conditional distributions that result, a highly expressive sequence model is necessary.\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are powerful models that offer a compact, shared parametrization of a series of conditional distributions. RNNs have been shown to excel at hard sequence problems ranging from handwriting generation (Graves, 2013), to character prediction (Sutskever et al., 2011) and to machine translation (Kalchbrenner & Blunsom, 2013). A two-dimensional RNN has produced very promising results in modeling grayscale images and textures .\nIn this paper we advance two-dimensional RNNs and ap-arXiv:1601.06759v3 [cs.CV] 19 Aug 2016\nx 1\nx i\nx n\nx n 2", "publication_ref": ["b18", "b11", "b13", "b16", "b0", "b3", "b25", "b9"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Context", "text": "x n 2\nMulti-scale context\nx 1 x i x n x n 2 R G B R G B R G B Mask A Mask B Context Figure 2.

In subsequent layers, the channels are also connected to themselves.\nply them to large-scale modeling of natural images. The resulting PixelRNNs are composed of up to twelve, fast two-dimensional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. These layers use LSTM units in their state (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997;Graves & Schmidhuber, 2009) and adopt a convolution to compute at once all the states along one of the spatial dimensions of the data. We design two types of these layers. The first type is the Row LSTM layer where the convolution is applied along each row; a similar technique is described in (Stollenga et al., 2015). The second type is the Diagonal BiLSTM layer where the convolution is applied in a novel fashion along the diagonals of the image. The networks also incorporate residual connections (He et al., 2015) around LSTM layers; we observe that this helps with training of the PixelRNN for up to twelve layers of depth.\nWe also consider a second, simplified architecture which shares the same core components as the PixelRNN. We observe that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can also be used as sequence model with a fixed dependency range, by using Masked convolutions. The PixelCNN architecture is a fully convolutional network of fifteen layers that preserves the spatial resolution of its input throughout the layers and outputs a conditional distribution at each location.\nBoth PixelRNN and PixelCNN capture the full generality of pixel inter-dependencies without introducing independence assumptions as in e.g., latent variable models. The dependencies are also maintained between the RGB color values within each individual pixel. Furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches that model the pixels as continuous values (e.g., ; Gregor et al. (2014)), we model the pixels as discrete values using a multinomial distribution implemented with a simple softmax layer. We observe that this approach gives both representational and training advantages for our models.\nThe contributions of the paper are as follows. In Section 3 we design two types of PixelRNNs corresponding to the two types of LSTM layers; we describe the purely convolutional PixelCNN that is our fastest architecture; and we design a Multi-Scale version of the PixelRNN. In Section 5 we show the relative benefits of using the discrete softmax distribution in our models and of adopting residual connections for the LSTM layers. Next we test the models on MNIST and on CIFAR-10 and show that they obtain loglikelihood scores that are considerably better than previous results. We also provide results for the large-scale Ima-geNet dataset resized to both 32 \u00d7 32 and 64 \u00d7 64 pixels; to our knowledge likelihood values from generative models have not previously been reported on this dataset.

For each pixel it predicts the conditional distribution over the possible pixel values given the scanned context. Figure 2 illustrates this process. The joint distribution over the image pixels is factorized into a product of conditional distributions. The parameters used in the predictions are shared across all pixel positions in the image.\nTo capture the generation process,  propose to use a two-dimensional LSTM network (Graves & Schmidhuber, 2009) that starts at the top left pixel and proceeds towards the bottom right pixel. The advantage of the LSTM network is that it effectively handles long-range dependencies that are central to object and scene understanding.

For a pixel x i the layer captures a roughly triangular context above the pixel as shown in Figure 4 (center). The kernel of the one- dimensional convolution has size k \u00d7 1 where k \u2265 3; the larger the value of k the broader the context that is captured. The weight sharing in the convolution ensures translation invariance of the computed features along each row.\nThe computation proceeds as follows. An LSTM layer has an input-to-state component and a recurrent state-to-state component that together determine the four gates inside the LSTM core. To enhance parallelization in the Row LSTM the input-to-state component is first computed for the entire two-dimensional input map; for this a k \u00d7 1 convolution is used to follow the row-wise orientation of the LSTM itself.\nThe convolution is masked to include only the valid context (see Section 3.4) and produces a tensor of size 4h \u00d7 n \u00d7 n, representing the four gate vectors for each position in the input map, where h is the number of output feature maps.\nTo compute one step of the state-to-state component of the LSTM layer, one is given the previous hidden and cell states h i\u22121 and c i\u22121 , each of size h \u00d7 n \u00d7 1. The new hidden and cell states h i , c i are obtained as follows:\n[o i , f i , i i , g i ] = \u03c3(K ss h i\u22121 + K is x i ) c i = f i c i\u22121 + i i g i h i = o i tanh(c i )(3)\nwhere x i of size h \u00d7 n \u00d7 1 is row i of the input map, and represents the convolution operation and the elementwise multiplication. The weights K ss and K is are the kernel weights for the state-to-state and the input-to-state components, where the latter is precomputed as described above. In the case of the output, forget and input gates o i , f i and i i , the activation \u03c3 is the logistic sigmoid function, whereas for the content gate g i , \u03c3 is the tanh function. Each step computes at once the new state for an entire row of the input map.

Each of the two directions of the layer scans the image in a diagonal fashion starting from a corner at the top and reaching the opposite corner at the bottom. Each step in the computation computes at once the LSTM state along a diagonal in the image. Figure 4 (right) illustrates the computation and the resulting receptive field.\nThe diagonal computation proceeds as follows. We first skew the input map into a space that makes it easy to apply convolutions along diagonals. The skewing operation offsets each row of the input map by one position with respect to the previous row, as illustrated in Figure 3; this results in a map of size n \u00d7 (2n \u2212 1). At this point we can compute the input-to-state and state-to-state components of the Diagonal BiLSTM. For each of the two directions, the input-to-state component is simply a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution K is that contributes to the four gates in the LSTM core; the operation generates a 4h \u00d7 n \u00d7 n tensor. The state-to-state recurrent component is then computed with a column-wise convolution K ss that has a kernel of size 2 \u00d7 1. The step takes the previous hidden and cell states, combines the contribution of the input-to-state component and produces the next hidden and cell states, as defined in Equation 3. The output feature map is then skewed back into an n \u00d7 n map by removing the offset positions. This computation is repeated for each of the two directions. Given the two output maps, to prevent the layer from seeing future pixels, the right output map is then shifted down by one row and added to the left output map.\nBesides reaching the full dependency field, the Diagonal BiLSTM has the additional advantage that it uses a convolutional kernel of size 2 \u00d7 1 that processes a minimal amount of information at each step yielding a highly nonlinear computation. Kernel sizes larger than 2 \u00d7 1 are not particularly useful as they do not broaden the already global receptive field of the Diagonal BiLSTM.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_2", "fig_1"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Residual Connections", "text": "We train PixelRNNs of up to twelve layers of depth. As a means to both increase convergence speed and propagate signals more directly through the network, we deploy residual connections (He et al., 2015) from one LSTM layer to the next. Figure 5 shows a diagram of the residual blocks.\nThe input map to the PixelRNN LSTM layer has 2h features. The input-to-state component reduces the number of features by producing h features per gate. After applying the recurrent layer, the output map is upsampled back to 2h features per position via a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution and the input map is added to the output map. This method is related to previous approaches that use gating along the depth of the recurrent network (Kalchbrenner et al., 2015;Zhang et al., 2016), but has the advantage of not requiring additional gates. Apart from residual connections, one can also use learnable skip connections from each layer to the output.\nIn the experiments we evaluate the relative effectiveness of residual and layer-to-output skip connections. \nReLU -1x1 Conv + ReLU -3x3 Conv h 2h ReLU -1x1 Conv h 2h LSTM + 2h 1x1 Conv h 2h", "publication_ref": ["b7", "b10", "b31"], "figure_ref": ["fig_3"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Masked Convolution", "text": "The h features for each input position at every layer in the network are split into three parts, each corresponding to one of the RGB channels.

To restrict connections in the network to these dependencies, we apply a mask to the inputto-state convolutions and to other purely convolutional layers in a PixelRNN.\nWe use two types of masks that we indicate with mask A and mask B, as shown in Figure 2 (Right). Mask A is applied only to the first convolutional layer in a PixelRNN and restricts the connections to those neighboring pixels and to those colors in the current pixels that have already been predicted. On the other hand, mask B is applied to all the subsequent input-to-state convolutional transitions and relaxes the restrictions of mask A by also allowing the connection from a color to itself.

When uniform noise is added (with values in the interval [0, 1]), then the log-likelihoods of continuous and discrete models are directly comparable . In our case, we can use the values from the discrete distribution as a piecewiseuniform continuous function that has a constant value for every interval [i, i + 1], i = 1, 2, . . . 256. This corresponding distribution will have the same log-likelihood (on data with added noise) as the original discrete distribution (on discrete data).\nFor MNIST we report the negative log-likelihood in nats as it is common practice in literature. For CIFAR-10 and ImageNet we report negative log-likelihoods in bits per dimension. The total discrete log-likelihood is normalized by the dimensionality of the images (e.g., 32 \u00d7 32 \u00d7 3 = 3072 for CIFAR-10).
