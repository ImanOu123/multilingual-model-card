Most computational research in second language (L2) has focused on spelling and grammar errors, and has been conducted on learners with beginner-tointermediate proficiency level (henceforth, \"learners\") (e.g. Ji et al., 2017;Sakaguchi et al., 2017;Rozovskaya et al., 2017;Lo et al., 2018). Little empirical work has looked at semantic errors, with existing research mostly focusing on collocations (e.g., Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011;Vecchi et al., 2011;Kochmar and Briscoe, 2013). Also, highly proficient, advanced L2 speakers (henceforth, \"advanced L2s\") have received little attention (though see Daudaravicius et al., 2016). In contrast to learners, these speakers rarely violate grammatical norms of the L2, but rather deviate from native usage in much more nuanced ways, often exhibiting mild infelicities rather than outright errors.\nWe aim to explore an elusive aspect of mastering the subtle contours of a word's meaning that are shaped by its context. Specifically, we investigate patterns of acquisition of English indefinite pronouns by L2 speakers. Indefinite pronouns (IPs) are linguistic devices that refer to an entity (such as a person or thing) that has not yet been introduced in discourse. In English, examples are words like someone, anything, and nobody. Consider the following sentences, taken verbatim from corpora of L2 speakers (original pronoun is boldfaced; less felicitous usages marked with '?'). 1 1. Do you know someone/anyone who was discriminated based on gender?\n2. It was a little amazing, because they didn't stole ?something/anything.\n3. ??Anyone/Someone told me the company has millions in debts and isn't able to pay it.\nClearly, mastery of IPs in English relies on recognizing subtle factors that determine their appropriate usage in various contexts.\nHere, in Section 2, we develop a linguistic analysis with detailed hypotheses on precisely how the tangled relations between someand anypronouns, exemplified above, pose a challenge for L2 learners. In Sections 3 and 4, we perform a largescale investigation of these linguistic predictions using productions of both learners and advanced L2s, and find that the predicted infelicities occur not only in the language of the former but also the latter, albeit (as expected) to a lesser extent.\nA practical goal of this work is to gain predictive power regarding the nuanced semantic difficulties that L2 speakers face. As a first step in that direction, in Section 5 we consider the ability of deep learning language models (LMs) -shown to be adept at capturing grammatical phenomena (Ji Usage class some-? any-? Example specific (SP) I had to reevaluate things when someone pointed that out. non-specific (NS)\nSomeone please make me a GIF of that Wade dunk. question (QU) Anyone know what the issue might be? conditional (CD) I would love it if someone could explain it in a more precise way. indirect negation (IN) I don't understand how anyone can really hate on him. direct negation (DN) I don't have anything to add other than to say thanks for typing this out. comparison (CP)\nIf you work harder you deserve to earn more than someone who doesn't do so. free choice (FC) ...they invite anyone on, including musicians sometimes.  Sakaguchi et al., 2017;Marvin and Linzen, 2018;Goldberg, 2019) -to identify the subtle infelicities that stem from the semantic confusion introduced by someand any-IPs. We show that while state-of-the-art models obtain encouraging initial results on this task, they leave room for future improvement (possibly informed by our linguistic findings) in mastering the semantic nuances of the system of English IPs. The contribution of this work is thus three-fold: First, to our knowledge, we develop the first largescale empirical investigation of second-language acquisition of indefinite pronouns, constituting a case study of taking a computational approach in linguistic analysis to yield novel insights into challenges in L2 acquisition. Second, we suggest and evaluate an automatic approach to detect infelicities stemming from these challenges in a large collection of L2 productions. Finally, in both cases, we extend our experiments to utterances of highly proficient L2 speakers -a population that has heretofore received little attention in the context of automatic error/infelicity detection. 2", "publication_ref": ["b15", "b26", "b25", "b21", "b6", "b27", "b18", "b7", "b26", "b22", "b11"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Linguistic Insights into English IPs", "text": "Previous work has suggested that the English system of IPs is crosslinguistically atypical, with precise analogues to someand anyunusual across languages (Haspelmath, 1997;Beekhuizen et al., 2017). Building on a suggestion from Beekhuizen et al. (2017), we analyze the factors that could lead to difficulty in learning these IPs, and develop detailed hypotheses concerning the challenges that L2 speakers are predicted to face.\nOur analysis is based on patterns of colexification (Franois, 2008): that is, how usages expressing different semantics are grouped (or not) in various combinations under a single word. As the basis for our analysis, we first need to specify the allowable semantic and syntactic usages of IPs. These usage classes are adapted from Haspelmath (1997), who outlines a universal set of IP semantic functions across all languages. 3 Our usage classes are shown in Table 1, with an indication of the classes that someand anycan express.\nTable 1 illustrates a striking fact about colexification of the usage classes in English: someand anyeach cover a very broad range of classes, with a high degree of overlap. This level of overlap in languages appears to be very rare: in the 40 languages studied by Haspelmath (1997), we find that only some 10% of languages have IPs that overlap over such a broad area of the semantic space. 4 Within any of these classes, some semantic/syntactic contexts call for just one of someor any-, while others allow both, but with differing meanings (and frequencies/preferences). For example, these similar contexts allow both, but the preferred pronoun differs: 1. ...people care a lot if something is a repost... 2. ...before you know if anything is wrong... We thus predict a difficulty for English L2 speakers in having to choose between two (not interchangeable) terms that can be used in highly similar semantic/syntactic environments.\nIn addition to looking at difficulties posed by the colexification of IPs within English, we can consider crosslinguistic patterns of colexification for further insight. Semantic typologists have proposed (and empirically supported, across many domains) that the more two underlying concepts are colexified across languages, the more similar those two concepts are (e.g., Anderson, 1982). In this way, crosslinguistic patterns of colexification can be used to deduce pairwise similarity among concepts, yielding a universal semantic similarity space for a domain (e.g., Berlin and Kay, 1969;Levinson et al., 2003).\nHere, we derive such a similarity space over the IP usage classes of Table 1, using the colexification data across 40 languages, from Haspelmath (1997). 5 We form a distance matrix (found in supplemental materials, A.1) by recording, for every pair of usage classes, the number of languages that have a term subsuming both those classes (indicating their relative similarity). We then use Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to project the space onto two dimensions, as exemplified in Figure 1. 6 Figure 1 demonstrates, first, that SP, FC, and DN form three natural \"extremes\" of the semantic space. In English, these correspond to the canonical uses of the IPs some-, any-, and no-, respectively; thus someis anchored at SP and anyat FC (cf. Table 1). Moreover, we find that the usage classes of QU and CD are very close to SP and NS, indicating that QU and CD are most frequently colexified with SP/NS, in particular, much more so than with FC. For English, this means that it is much more natural for someto express QU/CD than for anyto do so.\nTo summarize, our linguistic analysis reveals two potential challenges of English someand any-: their confusability across many classes, and the particular difficulty of anyin the QU/CD classes. We further find empirically that some-IPs are more frequent than anyin native English text, suggesting that somewill be easier for L2 speakers, and that they may overgeneralize it when faced with uncertainty of which pronoun to use. Collectively, these findings motivate: Hypothesis 1: The unusually large and overlapping extents of someand anyare expected to pose difficulty for L2 speakers; anyis predicted to be especially difficult due to its lower frequency.\nHypothesis 2: Due to greater naturalness of grouping QU and CD with other classes subsumed by some-, we predict that QU and CD usages of anywill be particularly difficult for L2 speakers.\nIn exploring each of these hypotheses, we look for evidence in two forms: overuse of somecompared to native speakers, and more errors involving any-. We focus on the frequent semantic categories of people and things, specifically the set of IPs someone, anyone, something, and anything. 7\n3 Materials and Methods", "publication_ref": ["b13", "b1", "b1", "b9", "b13", "b13", "b0", "b2", "b19", "b13"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0", "fig_0"], "table_ref": ["tab_0", "tab_0", "tab_0", "tab_0"]}, {"heading": "Datasets", "text": "We expect that mastery of IPs will depend on a speaker's command of English, and therefore consider language productions both of learners (largely beginner-to-intermediate), and of L2 speakers on Reddit (shown to be highly proficient, almost on par with Reddit natives; Rabinovich et al. 2018).

In English, the IP usage classes are often associated with particular lexical or syntactic cues in the clause with the IP -e.g., a negative adverb for DN (I don't want anything from this collection.), or a question mark for QU (Would you like to buy something online?). This enabled us to develop a rule-based classifier (see supplemental materials (A.3) for details), using a parser (Kitaev and Klein, 2018) and a set of heuristic rules.\nWe evaluated the classifier on sentences manually annotated by three in-house native English speakers with a background in linguistics. A sample of 750 sentences produced by Reddit native English speakers was selected for annotation, and the annotators assigned a label to each sentence from within the set of {DN, QU, CD, CP, MIXED}, where the MIXED class comprises the SP, NS, FC, and IN classes (cf. Table 1). The MIXED grouping contains classes that are (1) difficult to distinguish using simple lexical and syntactic cues (essentially, an \"other\" class), and (2) predicted by our linguistic analysis to be relatively similar in their error patterns. Average annotator agreement on our task was \u03ba = 0.932; detailed annotation guidelines can be found in supplemental materials (A.2).\nTable 3 shows that our rule-based classification is a reliable way to categorize a sentence with an IP (five-way classification baseline is 0.2). Because we use a subset of sentences associated with each usage class throughout our experiments, we focus on classification precision, while maintaining recall. We use this classifier to automatically label L2 sentences by usage class.

We extracted a randomly sampled set of 3, 711 sentences from our learner corpus representing a balanced distribution over the five usage classes, 8 and a similar set of 10, 000 sentences from our advanced L2 (Reddit) corpus, each containing a usage of someone, something, anyone, or anything. 9 Each sentence was annotated by five native English speakers in a choicebased annotation scheme. The occurrence of the IP in the sentence was replaced with a blank line, and each annotator marked their preference for the someor anypronoun in that context (or \"other\"), reflecting the most natural choice between the two. The gold annotation for each sentence was determined by its majority choice, and the confidence score was computed based on the number of selections (out of five annotators) of each of the two pronouns. Annotation guidelines and a sample of 500 manually annotated sentences can be found in the supplemental materials (A.4). Table 4 presents example sentences produced by learners and L2 Reddit authors where the majority annotation unanimously differed from the original pronoun (as indicated). The utterances are provided verbatim, maintaining grammatical errors typical to productions in our corpora.\nSentences with a confidence level \u2264 0.6 are considered close to equally felicitous with either pronoun, while the confidence of 1 represents a unanimous preference for one of the alternatives. Because we used a forced-choice task, if both pronouns were acceptable (e.g., Did you see something/anything you like?), we expect that the confidence score will indicate the level of naturalness or typicality of the pronoun in that context. For this reason, we only consider an example infelicitous when it differs from annotator choice with a confidence \u2265 0.8, which indicates a stronger preference for one pronoun over the other.\nThe final annotation results include 50% (1556) and 77% (2857) of sentences with a confidence of 1.0 and of \u2265 0.8, respectively, for learners. Our advanced L2 data has 56% (5639) of sentences with a confidence of 1.0 and 81% (8079) of \u2265 0.8.\nA question arises as to how meaningful it is to label an IP usage as infelicitous -i.e., the preferred IP in annotation differed from the original -if both someand anyare in fact acceptable.

The subtle distinction between these pronoun types is assumed to be better mastered by advanced L2 speakers, so we expect the divergence from the native distribution to be amplified in learners' productions. Figure 2 presents relative frequencies of someand anypronouns in a random sample of 5M native, advanced L2, and learner productions, both in the entire sample (left) and distributed by usage class (right). In line with our predictions, we find in Figure 2 (left) that overall, L2 speakers use somepronouns more than anypronouns compared to native speakers. We can further see in Figure 2 (right), and discussed in detail below, that this pattern occurs in almost all the IP usage classes, especially pronounced for learners.\nElaborating on Hypothesis 1, we further suggest that in addition to general overuse of somevs. any-(which may partly be due to avoidance of any-), L2 speakers are also expected in their infelicities to more often use somewhere native speakers would use any-, than vice versa. This prediction is also supported by our annotated data: In cases where the preferred pronoun is some-, learners infelicitously use any-8.4% of the time, but in cases where the preferred pronoun is any-, learners infelicitously use somealmost 23% of the time. That is, learners have almost three times as many infelicities of using someinstead of anythan the reverse. Our advanced L2s speakers also show more infelicities using someinstead of anythan vice versa, but the difference is less pronounced (5.8% and 10.1% respectively), as we expect given their greater proficiency.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Distribution of Infelicitous Usages", "text": "Next we turn to Hypothesis 2 from Section 2, which further predicts that the precise extent of deviation from native-like usage patterns will not be distributed uniformly across the different usage classes, but rather there will be a higher degree of deviation in classes that are atypically grouped under any--that is, QU and CD -than in those that introduce less of a semantic challenge (DN, CP, and those in the MIXED class). L2 speakers are expected to exhibit both more overuse of someand more infelicities in the QU and CD classes.\nOur predictions regarding the non-uniform overuse of someare largely borne out in Figure 2: the classes expected to be most difficult for L2 speakers -QU and CD -show a significant difference not only for learners, but even for advanced L2 speakers compared to natives, while DN and CP show only a difference for learners.\nA few observations from Figure 2 do not follow our hypothesis. First, the difference in learner usage of somevs. anyfor DN goes in the direction opposite to the prediction: i.e., learners use anymore than somepronouns in direct negation.

Second, the MIXED grouping also shows a difference for the advanced L2 speakers, although these usages are not predicted to be especially difficult by our linguistic analysis. This class contains a very large and diverse set of usages, making it difficult to predict what is driving this effect, and we leave this for future work. Finally, the largest gap in overuse of somevs. anyis observed in the CP class for learners, thereby not complying with our prediction of the highest difficulty being introduced by the QU and CD classes. Note, however, that this result is based on a relatively small amount of data in the CP class for learners (only 124 sentences; see Table 5).\nTo consider the pattern of infelicities across the usage classes, Table 5 shows the results from our crowdsourced annotation of IP usages of learners (top) and advanced L2s (bottom), separated by the classes. As expected, learners exhibit a very high percentage of infelicities in the QU class (24%); the CD class is not nearly as bad (12%), but is still higher than the other three (8-9%). Although advanced L2s have much fewer infelicities than learners, they also have more in the QU and CD classes (7% and over 9% respectively) than in the others (5-6%). Thus, as with Hypothesis 1, Hypothesis 2 is largely borne out by the data, and we find additional evidence that the IP system of English is particularly challenging for beginning to intermediate learners.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_0"]}, {"heading": "Automatic Detection of Infelicities", "text": "Our motivation for the above analysis is to use these insights to drive development of tools for L2 learners. Here we consider the first step, that of detection of infelicities with a language model (LM). Neural network based approaches are currently among the most successful LMs. While being easily applied to a wide range of tasks, they provide significant improvements over classic backoff ngram models. A common use of a pre-trained LM -typically trained on an extremely large corpus -is to predict the likelihood of an 'unseen' sample of text: The higher the score (or the lower the perplexity) a text is assigned, the more probable it is, given the model. In particular, a fluent, wellformed text is likely to be scored higher by an LM than a text containing linguistic anomalies.\nEncouraged by results on the task of grammatical error detection (Yuan and Briscoe, 2016;Ji et al., 2017), we adhere to a similar approach, casting the detection of infelicities as a binary classification scenario: An LM is applied on a sentence with an original pronoun (e.g., something) and on the same sentence where the pronoun is substituted with its alternative (e.g., anything); then the one predicted as more probable (scored highest) is chosen as a model decision.", "publication_ref": ["b29", "b15"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Models", "text": "Aiming to test the effect of various factors, such as training data size and register, on the predictive power of LMs in our task, we used both pretrained models and models trained locally on indomain, albeit much smaller, data.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Gulordava et al.:", "text": "A successful variant of RNNs, the long short-term memory model (LSTM, Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), used for syntactic error detection in Gulordava et al.

We also report the overall accuracy of each, computed as the ratio of correctly classified cases out of all sentences. Following the intuition laid out in Section 3.3, we conducted two sets of experiments: (1) considering cases where annotators' confidence score was 0.8 or higher, and (2) considering cases with confidence of 1. Sentences with a lower confidence score (i.e., where both someand anywere roughly equally preferred) were excluded from these experiments.", "publication_ref": ["b12", "b12", "b16", "b5", "b8", "b11"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Results and discussion", "text": "Tables 6 and 7 present the results for learners and advanced L2 speakers, each split by the degree of annotation confidence.

BERT performs best overall, and both it and Google 1B exceed the baseline for learners, but BERT performs only at baseline for advanced L2s, confirming the extreme difficulty of this task. Results obtained for the correct class are far superior to those for the infelicitous class, suggestive of the inherent difficulty of the latter cases, compared to (occasionally clear-cut) correct usage patterns.\nSystematically higher scores obtained for learner utterances (Table 6), compared to advanced L2s (Table 7), imply that the mild infelicities of the latter pose a higher challenge to automatic tools. That is, not only do advanced L2s show fewer errors, but their errors are likely more subtle and more difficult to detect. The highconfidence setup (= 1.0) yields results superior to those produced by the lower-confidence setup (\u2265 0.8), further supporting that clear-cut infelicities are more easily captured by an LM.\nReturning to our linguistic predictions, the preference of someover anypredicted by Hypothesis 1 and shown for non-native speakers (Section 4.1) does not hold for our best-performing LM.

Most studies used a supervised setup for selecting a correct choice (e.g., a preposition) out of a set of multiple alternatives, rendering our experimental setup not directly comparable.\nAnother line of work has assessed the capability of neural LMs to capture errors stemming from violation of syntax-sensitive dependencies (Linzen et al., 2016;Gulordava et al., 2018;Marvin and Linzen, 2018).

Most has been focused on the felicity of word combinations, such as identifying disfluencies stemming from L1 paraphrases (e.g., eat medicine or look movies, Brooke and Hirst, 2011;Dahlmeier and Ng, 2011), or using models of compositionality to detect semantically deviant pairs (residential steak, Vecchi et al., 2011) or infelicitous collocations (?big importance vs. great importance, Kochmar and Briscoe, 2013).

Not surprisingly, we find that the more clearcut errors exhibited by learners are easier to automatically identify than the potentially more subtle errors that arise with advanced L2 speakers. The best performing language model shows a varying match to human patterns of difficulty, raising issues for further research regarding the factors that influence difficulty for both humans and language models.\nThe practical impact of this work will be in facilitating the development of educational applications for L2 English speakers at various levels of proficiency.
