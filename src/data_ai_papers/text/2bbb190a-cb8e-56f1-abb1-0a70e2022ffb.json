The goal is to enable robust transfer to highly specialized domains, and so no metadata or alias tables are assumed. In this setting, entities are only identified by text descriptions, and models must rely strictly on language understanding to resolve the new entities. First, we show that strong reading comprehension models pre-trained on large unlabeled data can be used to generalize to unseen entities. Second, we propose a simple and effective adaptive pre-training strategy, which we term domainadaptive pre-training (DAP), to address the domain shift problem associated with linking unseen entities in a new domain. We present experiments on a new dataset that we construct for this task and show that DAP improves over strong pre-training baselines, including BERT.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Entity linking systems have achieved high performance in settings where a large set of disambiguated mentions of entities in a target entity dictionary is available for training. Such systems typically use powerful resources such as a high-coverage alias table, structured data, and linking frequency statistics. For example, Milne and Witten (2008) show that by only using the prior probability gathered from hyperlink statistics on Wikipedia training articles, one can achieve 90% accuracy on the task of predicting links in Wikipedia test articles.\nWhile most prior works focus on linking to general entity databases, it is often desirable to link to specialized entity dictionaries such as legal cases, company project descriptions, the set of characters in a novel, or a terminology glossary. Unfortunately, labeled data are not readily available and are often expensive to obtain for these specialized entity dictionaries. Therefore, we need to develop entity linking systems that can generalize to unseen specialized entities. Without frequency statistics and meta-data, the task becomes substantially more challenging. Some prior works have pointed out the importance of building entity linking systems that can generalize to unseen entity sets (Sil et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2015), but adopt an additional set of assumptions.\nIn this work, we propose a new zero-shot entity linking task, and construct a new dataset for it. 2 The target dictionary is simply defined as a set of entities, each with a text description (from a canonical entity page, for example). We do not constrain mentions to named entities, unlike some prior work, which makes the task harder due to large number of candidate entities. In our dataset, multiple entity dictionaries are available for training, with task performance measured on a disjoint set of test entity dictionaries for which no labeled data is available. Figure 1 illustrates the task setup. We construct the dataset using multiple sub-domains in Wikia and automatically extract labeled mentions using hyper-links.\nZero-shot entity linking poses two challenges for entity linking models. First, without the availability of powerful alias tables or frequency priors, models must read entity descriptions and reason about the correspondence with the mention in context. We show that a strong reading comprehension model is crucial. Second, since labeled mentions for test entities are not available, models must adapt to new mention contexts and entity descriptions. We focus on both of these challenges.\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a new zero-shot entity linking task that aims to challenge the generalization ability of entity linking systems with minimal assumptions. We construct a dataset for this task, which will be made publicly available.\n\u2022 We build a strong baseline by using state-of-theart reading comprehension models. We show that attention between mention in context and entity descriptions, which has not been used in prior entity linking work, is critical for this task.\n\u2022 We propose a simple yet novel adaptation strategy called domain-adaptive pre-training (DAP) and show that it can further improve entity linking performance.", "publication_ref": ["b15", "b21", "b23"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Zero-shot Entity Linking", "text": "We first review standard entity linking task definitions and discuss assumptions made by prior systems.

Formally, given a mention m and its context, an entity linking system links m to the corresponding entity in an entity set E = {e i } i=1,...,K , where K is the number of entities. The standard definition of EL (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006;Roth et al., 2014;Sil et al., 2018) assumes that mention boundaries are provided by users or a mention detection system. The entity set E can contain tens of thousands or even millions of entities, making this a challenging task.

These statistics are very powerful when available.\nStructured data Some systems assume access to structured data such as relationship tuples (e.g., (Barack Obama, Spouse, Michelle Obama)) or a type hierarchy to aid disambiguation.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Task Definition", "text": "The main motivation for this task is to expand the scope of entity linking systems and make them generalizable to unseen entity sets for which none of the powerful resources listed above are readily available.

We define a world as  (Sil et al., 2012) Zero-Shot EL \nW = (M W , U W , E W ),", "publication_ref": ["b21"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Relationship to other EL tasks", "text": "We summarize the relationship between the newly introduced zero-shot entity linking task and prior EL task definitions in Table 1.\nStandard EL While there are numerous differences between EL datasets (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006;Ling et al., 2015), most focus on a standard setting where mentions from a comprehensive test entity dictionary (often Wikipedia) are seen during training, and rich statistics and meta-data can be utilized (Roth et al., 2014). Labeled in-domain documents with mentions are also assumed to be available.\nCross-Domain EL Recent work has also generalized to a cross-domain setting, linking entity mentions in different types of text, such as blogposts and news articles to the Wikipedia KB, while only using labeled mentions in Wikipedia for training (e.g., Gupta et al. (2017); Le and Titov (2018), inter alia).\nLinking to Any DB Sil et al. (2012) proposed a task setup very similar to ours, and later work (Wang et al., 2015) has followed a similar setting. The main difference between zero-shot EL and these works is that they assumed either a highcoverage alias table or high-precision token overlap heuristics to reduce the size of the entity candidate set (i.e., to less than four in Sil et al. (2012)) and relied on structured data to help disambiguation. By compiling and releasing a multi-world dataset focused on learning from textual information, we hope to help drive progress in linking entities for a broader set of applications.\nWork on word sense disambiguation based on dictionary definitions of words is related as well (Chaplot and Salakhutdinov, 2018), but this task exhibits lower ambiguity and existing formulations have not focused on domain generalization.", "publication_ref": ["b0", "b14", "b19", "b10", "b13", "b23", "b21", "b1"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_1"]}, {"heading": "Dataset Construction", "text": "We construct a new dataset to study the zeroshot entity linking problem using documents from Wikia. 3 Wikias are community-written encyclopedias, each specializing in a particular subject or theme such as a fictional universe from a book or film series. Wikias have many interesting properties suitable for our task. Labeled mentions can be automatically extracted based on hyperlinks. Mentions and entities have rich document context that can be exploited by reading comprehension approaches. Each Wikia has a large number of unique entities relevant to a specific theme, making it a useful benchmark for evaluating domain generalization of entity linking systems.\nWe use data from 16 Wikias, and use 8 of them for training and 4 each for validation and testing. To construct data for training and evaluation, we first extract a large number of mentions from the Wikias. Many of these mentions can be easily linked by string matching between mention string  and the title of entity documents. These mentions are downsampled during dataset construction, and occupy a small percentage (5%) of the final dataset. While not completely representative of the natural distribution of mentions, this data construction method follows recent work that focuses on evaluating performance on the challenging aspects of the entity linking problem (e.g., Gupta et al. (2017) selected mentions with multiple possible entity candidates for assessing indomain unseen entity performance). Each Wikia document corresponds to an entity, represented by the title and contents of the document. These entities, paired with their text descriptions, comprise the entity dictionary. Since the task is already quite challenging, we assume that the target entity exists in the entity dictionary and leave NIL recognition or clustering (NIL mentions/entities refer to entities nonexistent in the knowledge-base) to future editions of the task and dataset.\nWe categorize the mentions based on token overlap between mentions and the corresponding entity title as follows. High Overlap: title is identical to mention text, Multiple Categories: title is mention text followed by a disambiguation phrase (e.g., mention string: 'Batman', title: 'Batman (Lego)'), Ambiguous substring: mention is a substring of title (e.g., mention string: 'Agent', title: 'The Agent'). All other mentions are categorized  as Low Overlap. These mentions respectively constitute approximately 5%, 28%, 8% and 59% of the mentions in the dataset.\nTable 2 shows some statistics of the dataset. Each domain has a large number of entities ranging from 10,000 to 100,000. The training set has 49,275 labeled mentions. To examine the indomain generalization performance, we construct heldout sets seen and unseen of 5,000 mentions each, composed of mentions that link to only entities that were seen or unseen during training, respectively. The validation and test sets have 10,000 mentions each (all of which are unseen).\nTable 3 shows examples of mentions and entities in the dataset. The vocabulary and language used in mentions and entity descriptions differs drastically between the different domains. In addition to acquiring domain specific knowledge, understanding entity descriptions and performing reasoning is required in order to resolve mentions.", "publication_ref": ["b10"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_3", "tab_5"]}, {"heading": "Models for Entity Linking", "text": "We adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of a fast candidate generation stage, followed by a more expensive but powerful candidate ranking stage.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Candidate generation", "text": "Without alias tables for standard entity linking, a natural substitute is to use an IR approach for candidate generation.

In our experiments k is set to 64. The coverage of the top-64 candidates is less than 77% on average, indicating the difficulty of the task and leaving substantial room for improvement in the candidate generation phase.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Candidate ranking", "text": "Since comparing two texts-a mention in context and a candidate entity description-is a task similar to reading comprehension and natural language inference tasks, we use an architecture based on a deep Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) which has achieved state-of-the-art performance on such tasks (Radford et al., 2018;Devlin et al., 2019).\nAs in BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), the mention in context m and candidate entity description e, each represented by 128 word-piece tokens, are concatenated and input to the model as a sequence pair together with special start and separator tokens:\n([CLS] m [SEP] e [SEP]\n). Mention words are signaled by a special embedding vector that is added to the mention word embeddings. The Transformer encoder produces a vector representation h m,e of the input pair, which is the output of the last hidden layer at the special pooling token [CLS]. Entities in a given candidate set are scored as w h m,e where w is a learned parameter vector, and the model is trained using a softmax loss. An architecture with 12 layers, hidden dimension size 768 and 12 attention heads was used in our experiments. We refer to this model as Full-Transformer. By jointly encoding the entity description and the mention in context with a Transformer, they can attend to each other at every layer.\nNote that prior neural approaches for entity linking have not explored such architectures with deep cross-attention. To assess the value of this departure from prior work, we implement the following two variants: (i) Pool-Transformer: a siamese-like network which uses two deep Transformers to separately derive single-vector repre-sentations of the mention in context, h m , and the candidate entity, h e ; they take as input the mention in context and entity description respectively, together with special tokens indicating the boundaries of the texts: ([CLS] m [SEP]) and ([CLS] e [SEP]), and output the last hidden layer encoding at the special start token. The scoring function is h m h e . Single vector representations for the two components have been used in many prior works, e.g., Gupta et al. (2017). (ii) Cand-Pool-Transformer: a variant which uses single vector entity representations but can attend to individual tokens of the mention and its context as in Ganea and Hofmann (2017). This architecture also uses two Transformer encoders, but introduces an additional attention module which allows h e to attend to individual token representations of the mention in context.\nIn the experiments section, we also compare to re-implementations of Gupta et al. (2017) and Ganea and Hofmann (2017), which are similar to Pool-Transformer and Cand-Pool-Transformer respectively but with different neural architectures for encoding.  Yang and Eisenstein (2015), inter alia, pre-trained on the source and target domain unlabeled data jointly with the goal of discovering features that generalize across domains. After pre-training, the model is fine-tuned on the source-domain labeled data. 6 Open-corpus pre-training Instead of explicitly adapting to a target domain, this approach simply applies unsupervised pre-training to large corpora before fine-tuning on the source-domain labeled data.

For example, U WB \u2192 U src+tgt \u2192 U tgt indicates that the model is first pre-trained on the open corpus, then pre-trained on the combined source and target domains, then pre-trained on only the target domain, and finally fine-tuned on the source-domain labeled data. 7 We show that chaining together different pre-training strategies provides additive gains.", "publication_ref": ["b11"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Experiments", "text": "Pre-training We use the BERT-Base model architecture in all our experiments.

The unnormalized performance is computed on the entire test set. Our IR-based candidate generation has a top-64 recall of 76% and 68% on the validation and test sets, respectively. The unnormalized performance is thus upper-bounded by these numbers. Strengthening the candidate generation stage improves the unnormalized performance, but this is outside the scope of our work.

We include naive baselines such as Levenshtein edit-distance and TF-IDF, which compare the mention string against candidate entity title and full document description, respectively, to rank candidate entities. We re-implemented recent neural models designed for entity linking (Ganea and Hofmann, 2017;Gupta et al., 2017), but did not expect them to perform well since the original systems were designed for settings where labeled mentions or meta-data for the target entities were available.  The poor performance of these models validates the necessity of using strong reading comprehension models for zero-shot entity linking.\nWhen using the Full-Transformer model, pretraining is necessary to achieve reasonable performance. We present results for models pre-trained on different subsets of our task corpus (U src , U tgt , U src+tgt ) as well as pre-training on an external large corpus (U WB ). We observe that the choice of data used for pre-training is important.\nIn Table 4 we also compare the Pool-Transformer, Candidate-Pool-Transformer and Full-Transformer. The significant gap between Full-Transformer and the other variants shows the importance of allowing fine-grained comparisons between the two inputs via the cross attention mechanism embedded in the Transformer.

Adding an additional pre-training stage on the target unlabeled data unsurprisingly improves the MLM accuracy. More interestingly, we find that improvements in MLM accuracy are consistently followed by improvements in entity linking accuracy.

Here, we briefly overview related entity linking models and unsupervised domain adaptation methods.\nEntity linking models Entity linking given mention boundaries as input can be broken into the tasks of candidate generation and candidate ranking. When frequency information or alias tables are unavailable, prior work has used measures of similarity of the mention string to entity names for candidate generation (Sil et al., 2012;Murty et al., 2018). For candidate ranking, recent work employed distributed representations of mentions in context and entity candidates and neural models to score their compatibility. Mentions in context have been represented using e.g., CNN (Murty et al., 2018), LSTM (Gupta et al., 2017), or bag-of-word embeddings (Ganea and Hofmann, 2017). Entity descriptions have been represented using similar architectures. To the best of our knowledge, while some models allow for crossattention between single-vector entity embeddings and mention-in-context token representations, no prior works have used full cross-attention between mention+context and entity descriptions.\nPrior work on entity linking tasks most similar to ours used a linear model comparing a mention in context to an entity description and associated structured data (Sil et al., 2012). Sil et al. (2012) also proposed a distant supervision approach which could use first-pass predictions for mentions in the target domain as noisy supervision for re-training an in-domain model. We believe this approach is complementary to unsupervised representation learning and could bring additional benefits. In another task similar to ours, Wang et al. (2015) used collective inference and target database relations to obtain good performance without (domain, target database)-specific labeled training data. Collective inference is another promising direction, but could have limited success when no metadata is available.\nUnsupervised domain adaptation There is a large body of work on methods for unsupervised domain adaptation, where a labeled training set is available for a source domain and unlabeled data is available for the target domain. The majority of work in this direction assume that training and test examples consist of (x, y) pairs, where y is in a fixed shared label set Y. This assumption holds for classification and sequence labeling, but not for zero-shot entity linking, since the source and target domains have disjoint labels.\nMost state-of-the-art methods learn non-linear shared representations of source and target domain instances, through denoising training objectives (Eisenstein, 2018). In Section 5, we overviewed such work and proposed an improved domain adaptive pre-training method.\nAdversarial training methods (Ganin et al., 2016), which have also been applied to tasks where the space Y is not shared between source and target domains (Cohen et al., 2018), and multisource domain adaptation methods (Zhao et al., 2018;Guo et al., 2018) are complementary to our work and can contribute to higher performance.", "publication_ref": ["b21", "b16", "b16", "b10", "b21", "b21", "b23", "b5", "b7", "b3", "b25", "b9"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Conclusion", "text": "We introduce a new task for zero-shot entity linking, and construct a multi-world dataset for it.
