In some language pairs, i.e. Chinese-to-English translation, state-ofthe-art hierarchical systems show significant advantage over phrasal systems in MT accuracy. For example, Chiang (2007) showed that the Hiero system achieved about 1 to 3 point improvement in BLEU on the NIST 03/04/05 Chinese-English evaluation sets compared to a start-of-the-art phrasal system.\nOur work extends the hierarchical MT approach. We propose a string-to-dependency model for MT, which employs rules that represent the source side as strings and the target side as dependency structures. We restrict the target side to the so called wellformed dependency structures, in order to cover a large set of non-constituent transfer rules , and enable efficient decoding through dynamic programming. We incorporate a dependency language model during decoding, in order to exploit long-distance word relations which are unavailable with a traditional n-gram language model on target strings.\nFor comparison purposes, we replicated the Hiero decoder (Chiang, 2005) as our baseline. Our stringto-dependency decoder shows 1.48 point improvement in BLEU and 2.53 point improvement in TER on the NIST 04 Chinese-English MT evaluation set.\nIn the rest of this section, we will briefly discuss previous work on hierarchical MT and dependency representations, which motivated our research.

In section 4, we describe the implementation details of our MT system. We discuss experimental results in section 5, compare to related work in section 6, and draw conclusions in section 7. Graehl and Knight (2004) proposed the use of targettree-to-source-string transducers (xRS) to model translation. In xRS rules, the right-hand-side(rhs) of the target side is a tree with non-terminals(NTs), while the rhs of the source side is a string with NTs. Galley et al. (2006) extended this string-to-tree model by using Context-Free parse trees to represent the target side. A tree could represent multi-level transfer rules.", "publication_ref": ["b10", "b2", "b5", "b19", "b3", "b2", "b10", "b9"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Hierarchical Machine Translation", "text": "The Hiero decoder (Chiang, 2007) does not require explicit syntactic representation on either side of the rules.

While tree-to-tree models can represent richer structural information, existing tree-totree models did not show advantage over string-totree models on translation accuracy due to a much larger search space.\nOne of the motivations of our work is to achieve desirable trade-off between model capability and search space through the use of the so called wellformed dependency structures in rule representation.", "publication_ref": ["b3", "b5", "b19", "b20"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Dependency Trees", "text": "Dependency trees reveal long-distance relations between words.

The use of dependency structures is due to the flexibility of dependency trees as a representation method which does not rely on constituents (Fox, 2002;Ding and Palmer, 2005;Quirk et al., 2005). The well-formedness of the dependency structures enables efficient decoding through dynamic programming.", "publication_ref": ["b9", "b22", "b4", "b7", "b5", "b19"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "String-to-Dependency Translation", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Transfer Rules with Well-Formed Dependency Structures", "text": "A string-to-dependency grammar G is a 4-tuple G =< R, X, T f , T e >, where R is a set of transfer rules. X is the only non-terminal, which is similar to the Hiero system (Chiang, 2007). T f is a set of terminals in the source language, and T e is a set of terminals in the target language 1 . A string-to-dependency transfer rule R \u2208 R is a 4-tuple R =< S f , S e , D, A >, where S f \u2208 (T f \u222a {X}) + is a source string, S e \u2208 (T e \u222a {X}) + is a target string, D represents the dependency structure for S e , and A is the alignment between S f and S e . Non-terminal alignments in A must be one-to-one.\nIn order to exclude undesirable structures, we only allow S e whose dependency structure D is well-formed, which we will define below. In addition, the same well-formedness requirement will be applied to partial decoding results. Thus, we will be able to employ shared structures to merge multiple partial results.\nBased on the results in previous work (DeNeefe et al., 2007), we want to keep two kinds of dependency structures. In one kind, we keep dependency trees with a sub-root, where all the children of the sub-root are complete. We call them fixed dependency structures because the head is known or fixed. In the other, we keep dependency structures of sibling nodes of a common head, but the head itself is unspecified or floating. Each of the siblings must be a complete constituent. We call them floating dependency structures. Floating structures can represent many linguistically meaningful non-constituent structures: for example, like the red, a modifier of a noun. Only those two kinds of dependency structures are well-formed structures in our system.\nFurthermore, we operate over well-formed structures in a bottom-up style in decoding. However, the description given above does not provide a clear definition on how to combine those two types of structures. In the rest of this section, we will provide formal definitions of well-formed structures and combinatory operations over them, so that we can easily manipulate well-formed structures in decoding. Formal definitions also allow us to easily extend the framework to incorporate a dependency language model in decoding. Examples will be provided along with the formal definitions.\nConsider a sentence S = w 1 w 2 ... Figure 3: Floating dependency structures on w 2 . If w i is a root, we define d i = 0.\nDefinition 1 A dependency structure d i..j is fixed on head h, where h \u2208 [i, j], or fixed for short, if and only if it meets the following conditions\n\u2022 d h / \u2208 [i, j] \u2022 \u2200k \u2208 [i, j] and k = h, d k \u2208 [i, j] \u2022 \u2200k / \u2208 [i, j], d k = h or d k / \u2208 [i, j]\nIn addition, we say the category of d i..j is (\u2212, h, \u2212), where \u2212 means this field is undefined.\nDefinition 2 A dependency structure d i ...d j is floating with children C, for a non-empty set C \u2286 {i, ..., j}, or floating for short, if and only if it meets the following conditions\n\u2022 \u2203h / \u2208 [i, j], s.t.\u2200k \u2208 C, d k = h \u2022 \u2200k \u2208 [i, j] and k / \u2208 C, d k \u2208 [i, j] \u2022 \u2200k / \u2208 [i, j], d k / \u2208 [i, j] We say the category of d i..j is (C, \u2212, \u2212) if j < h, or (\u2212, \u2212, C) otherwise.\nA category is composed of the three fields (A, h, B), where h is used to represent the head, and A and B are designed to model left and right dependents of the head respectively.\nA dependency structure is well-formed if and only if it is either fixed or floating.", "publication_ref": ["b3", "b4"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Examples", "text": "We can represent dependency structures with graphs. Figure 2 shows examples of fixed structures, Figure 3 shows examples of floating structures, and Figure 4 shows ill-formed dependency structures.\nIt is easy to verify that the structures in Figures 2 and 3  is ill-formed because it is not a continuous segment.\nAs for the example the red mentioned above, it is a well-formed floating dependency structure.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_1"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Operations on Well-Formed Dependency Structures and Categories", "text": "One of the purposes of introducing floating dependency structures is that siblings having a common parent will become a well-defined entity, although they are not considered a constituent. We always build well-formed partial structures on the target side in decoding. Furthermore, we combine partial dependency structures in a way such that we can obtain all possible well-formed but no ill-formed dependency structures during bottom-up decoding.\nThe solution is to employ categories introduced above. Each well-formed dependency structure has a category. We can apply four combinatory operations over the categories. If we can combine two categories with a certain category operation, we can use a corresponding tree operation to combine two dependency structures. The category of the combined dependency structure is the result of the combinatory category operations.\nWe first introduce three meta category operations. Two of them are unary operations, left raising (LR) and right raising (RR), and one is the binary operation unification (UF).\nFirst, the raising operations are used to turn a completed fixed structure into a floating structure. It is easy to verify the following theorem according to the definitions.\nTheorem 1 A fixed structure with category (\u2212, h, \u2212) for span [i, j] is also a floating structure with children {h} if there are no outside words depending on word h.\n\u2200k / \u2208 [i, j], d k = h.(1)\nTherefore we can always raise a fixed structure if we assume it is complete, i.e. (1) holds. \n\u2022 UF((A 1 , h 1 , B 1 ), (A 2 , h 2 , B 2 )) = NORM((A 1 A 2 , h 1 h 2 , B 1 B 2 ))\nUnification is well-defined if and only if we can unify all three elements and the result is a valid fixed or floating category. For example, we can unify a fixed structure with a floating structure or two floating structures in the same direction, but we cannot unify two fixed structures.\nh 1 h 2 = \uf8f1 \uf8f2 \uf8f3 h 1 if h 2 = \u2212 h 2 if h 1 = \u2212 undefined otherwise A 1 A 2 = \uf8f1 \uf8f2 \uf8f3 A 1 if A 2 = \u2212 A 2 if A 1 = \u2212 A 1 \u222a A 2 otherwise NORM((A, h, B)) = \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 (\u2212, h, \u2212) if h = \u2212 (A, \u2212, \u2212) if h = \u2212, B = \u2212 (\u2212, \u2212, B) if h = \u2212, A = \u2212 undefined otherwise\nNext we introduce the four tree operations on dependency structures. Instead of providing the formal definition, we use figures to illustrate these operations to make it easy to understand. Figure 1 shows a traditional dependency tree. Figure 5 shows the four operations to combine partial dependency structures, which are left adjoining (LA), right adjoining (RA), left concatenation (LC) and right concatenation (RC).\nChild and parent subtrees can be combined with adjoining which is similar to the traditional dependency formalism. We can either adjoin a fixed structure or a floating structure to the head of a fixed structure.\nComplete siblings can be combined via concatenation. We can concatenate two fixed structures, one fixed structure with one floating structure, or two floating structures in the same direction. The flexibility of the order of operation allows us to take ad- Figure 6 shows alternative ways of applying operations on well-formed structures to build larger structures in a bottom-up style. Numbers represent the order of operation.\nWe use the same names for the operations on categories for the sake of convenience. We can easily use the meta category operations to define the four combinatory operations. The definition of the operations in the left direction is as follows. Those in the right direction are similar.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_3"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Definition 4 Combinatory category operations", "text": "LA((A 1 , \u2212, \u2212), (\u2212, h 2 , \u2212)) = UF((A 1 , \u2212, \u2212), (\u2212, h 2 , \u2212)) LA((\u2212, h 1 , \u2212), (\u2212, h 2 , \u2212)) = UF(LR((\u2212, h 1 , \u2212)), (\u2212, h 2 , \u2212)) LC((A 1 , \u2212, \u2212), (A 2 , \u2212, \u2212)) = UF((A 1 , \u2212, \u2212), (A 2 , \u2212, \u2212)) LC((A 1 , \u2212, \u2212), (\u2212, h 2 , \u2212)) = UF((A 1 , \u2212, \u2212), LR((\u2212, h 2 , \u2212))) LC((\u2212, h 1 , \u2212), (A 2 , \u2212, \u2212)) = UF(LR((\u2212, h 1 , \u2212)), (A 2 , \u2212, \u2212)) LC((\u2212, h 1 , \u2212), (\u2212, h 2 , \u2212)) = UF(LR((\u2212, h 1 , \u2212)), LR((\u2212, h 2 , \u2212)))\nIt is easy to verify the soundness and completeness of category operations based on one-to-one mapping of the conditions in the definitions of corresponding operations on dependency structures and on categories.\nTheorem 2 (soundness and completeness) Suppose X and Y are well-formed dependency structures. OP(cat(X), cat(Y )) is well-defined for a given operation OP if and only if OP(X, Y ) is well-defined. Furthermore, cat(OP(X, Y )) = OP(cat(X), cat(Y ))\nSuppose we have a dependency tree for a red apple, where both a and red depend on apple.

We use a statistical CFG parser to parse the English side of the training data, and extract dependency trees with Magerman's rules (1995). Then we use heuristic rules to extract transfer rules recursively based on the GIZA alignment and the target dependency trees. The rule extraction procedure is as follows.\n1.

We view target dependency as the hidden structure of source fragments.\nThe parser scans all source cells in a bottom-up style, and checks matched transfer rules according to the source side. Once there is a completed rule, we build a larger dependency structure by substituting component dependency structures for corresponding NTs in the target dependency structure of rules.\nHypothesis dependency structures are organized in a shared forest, or AND-OR structures. An AND-structure represents an application of a rule over component OR-structures, and an OR-structure represents a set of alternative AND-structures with the same state. A state means a n-tuple that characterizes the information that will be inquired by up-level AND-structures.\nSupposing we use a traditional tri-gram language model in decoding, we need to specify the leftmost two words and the rightmost two words in a state. Since we only have a single NT X in the formalism described above, we do not need to add the NT label in states. However, we need to specify one of the three types of the dependency structure: fixed, floating on the left side, or floating on the right side. This information is encoded in the category of the dependency structure.\nIn the next section, we will explain how to extend categories and states to exploit a dependency language model during decoding.", "publication_ref": ["b9"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Dependency Language Model", "text": "For the dependency tree in Figure 1, we calculate the probability of the tree as follows Here P T (x) is the probability that word x is the root of a dependency tree.

We use dependency structures instead of strings; thus, the comparison will show the contribution of using dependency information in decoding.\nAll models are tuned on BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001), and evaluated on both BLEU and Translation Error Rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006) so that we could detect over-tuning on one metric.\nWe used part of the NIST 2006 Chinese-English large track data as well as some LDC corpora collected for the DARPA GALE program (LDC2005E83, LDC2006E34 and LDC2006G05) as our bilingual training data. It contains about 178M/191M words in source/target. Hierarchical rules were extracted from a subset which has about 35M/41M words 5 , and the rest of the training data were used to extract phrasal rules as in (Och, 2003;Chiang, 2005). The English side of this subset was also used to train a 3-gram dependency LM. Traditional 3-gram and 5-gram LMs were trained on a corpus of 6G words composed of the LDC Gigaword corpus and text downloaded from Web (Bulyko et al., 2007). We tuned the weights on NIST MT05 and tested on MT04.   Table 1 shows the number of transfer rules extracted from the training data for the tuning and test sets. The constraint of well-formed dependency structures greatly reduced the size of the rule set.
