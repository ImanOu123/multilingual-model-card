Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L log L) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Time-series forecasting is a critical ingredient across many domains, such as sensor network monitoring (Papadimitriou and Yu 2006), energy and smart grid management, economics and finance (Zhu and Shasha 2002), and disease propagation analysis (Matsubara et al. 2014). In these scenarios, we can leverage a substantial amount of time-series data on past behavior to make a forecast in the long run, namely long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF). However, existing methods are mostly designed under short-term problem setting, like predicting 48 points or less (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997;Li et al. 2018;Liu et al. 2019;Qin et al. 2017;Wen et al. 2017). The increasingly long sequences strain the models' prediction capacity to the point where this trend is holding the research on LSTF. As an empirical example, Fig. Figure 1: (a) LSTF can cover an extended period than the short sequence predictions, making vital distinction in policy-planning and investment-protecting. (b) The prediction capacity of existing methods limits LSTF's performance. E.g., starting from length=48, MSE rises unacceptably high, and the inference speed drops rapidly.\nhourly temperature of an electrical transformer station from the short-term period (12 points, 0.5 days) to the long-term period (480 points, 20 days). The overall performance gap is substantial when the prediction length is greater than 48 points (the solid star in Fig. (1b)), where the MSE rises to unsatisfactory performance, the inference speed gets sharp drop, and the LSTM model starts to fail. The major challenge for LSTF is to enhance the prediction capacity to meet the increasingly long sequence demand, which requires (a) extraordinary long-range alignment ability and (b) efficient operations on long sequence inputs and outputs. Recently, Transformer models have shown superior performance in capturing long-range dependency than RNN models. The self-attention mechanism can reduce the maximum length of network signals traveling paths into the theoretical shortest O(1) and avoid the recurrent structure, whereby Transformer shows great potential for the LSTF problem. Nevertheless, the self-attention mechanism violates requirement (b) due to its L-quadratic computation and memory consumption on L-length inputs/outputs. Some large-scale Transformer models pour resources and yield impressive results on NLP tasks (Brown et al. 2020), but the training on dozens of GPUs and expensive deploying cost make theses models unaffordable on real-world LSTF problem. The efficiency of the self-attention mechanism and Transformer architecture becomes the bottleneck of applying them to LSTF problems. Thus, in this paper, we seek to answer the question: can we improve Transformer models to be computation, memory, and architecture efficient, as well as maintaining higher prediction capacity?\nVanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) has three significant limitations when solving the LSTF problem: 1. The quadratic computation of self-attention. The atom operation of self-attention mechanism, namely canonical dot-product, causes the time complexity and memory usage per layer to be O(L 2 ). 2. The memory bottleneck in stacking layers for long inputs. The stack of J encoder/decoder layers makes total memory usage to be O(J \u2022 L 2 ), which limits the model scalability in receiving long sequence inputs. 3. The speed plunge in predicting long outputs. Dynamic decoding of vanilla Transformer makes the step-by-step inference as slow as ). There are some prior works on improving the efficiency of self-attention. The Sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019), LogSparse Transformer (Li et al. 2019), and Longformer (Beltagy, Peters, and Cohan 2020) all use a heuristic method to tackle limitation 1 and reduce the complexity of selfattention mechanism to O(L log L), where their efficiency gain is limited (Qiu et al. 2019). Reformer (Kitaev, Kaiser, and Levskaya 2019) also achieves O(L log L) with locallysensitive hashing self-attention, but it only works on extremely long sequences. More recently, Linformer (Wang et al. 2020) claims a linear complexity O(L), but the project matrix can not be fixed for real-world long sequence input, which may have the risk of degradation to O(L 2 ). Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) and Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) use auxiliary hidden states to capture long-range dependency, which could amplify limitation 1 and be adverse to break the efficiency bottleneck. All these works mainly focus on limitation 1, and the limitation 2&3 remains unsolved in the LSTF problem. To enhance the prediction capacity, we tackle all these limitations and achieve improvement beyond efficiency in the proposed Informer.\nTo this end, our work delves explicitly into these three issues. We investigate the sparsity in the self-attention mechanism, make improvements of network components, and conduct extensive experiments.

To further discuss the self-attention mechanism, let q i , k i , v i stand for the i-th row in Q, K, V respectively. Following the formulation in (Tsai et al. 2019), the i-th query's attention is defined as a kernel smoother in a probability form:\nA(q i , K, V) = j k(q i , k j ) l k(q i , k l ) v j = E p(kj |qi) [v j ] , (1)\nwhere p(k\nj |q i ) = k(q i , k j )/ l k(q i , k l ) and k(q i , k j ) selects the asymmetric exponential kernel exp(q i k j / \u221a d).\nThe self-attention combines the values and acquires outputs based on computing the probability p(k j |q i ). It requires the quadratic times dot-product computation and O(L Q L K ) memory usage, which is the major drawback when enhancing prediction capacity.\nSome previous attempts have revealed that the distribution of self-attention probability has potential sparsity, and they have designed \"selective\" counting strategies on all p(k j |q i ) without significantly affecting the performance. The Sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) incorporates both the row outputs and column inputs, in which the sparsity arises from the separated spatial correlation. The LogSparse Transformer (Li et al. 2019) notices the cyclical pattern in selfattention and forces each cell to attend to its previous one by an exponential step size. The Longformer (Beltagy, Peters, and Cohan 2020) extends previous two works to more complicated sparse configuration. However, they are limited to theoretical analysis from following heuristic methods and tackle each multi-head self-attention with the same strategy, which narrows their further improvement.\nTo motivate our approach, we first perform a qualitative assessment on the learned attention patterns of the canonical self-attention. The \"sparsity\" self-attention score forms a long tail distribution (see Appendix C for details), i.e., a few dot-product pairs contribute to the major attention, and others generate trivial attention. Then, the next question is how to distinguish them?\nQuery Sparsity Measurement From Eq.(1), the i-th query's attention on all the keys are defined as a probability p(k j |q i ) and the output is its composition with values v. The dominant dot-product pairs encourage the corresponding query's attention probability distribution away from the uniform distribution. If p(k j |q i ) is close to a uniform distribution q(k j |q i ) = 1/L K , the self-attention becomes a trivial sum of values V and is redundant to the residential input. Naturally, the \"likeness\" between distribution p and q can be used to distinguish the \"important\" queries. We measure the \"likeness\" through Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(q||p) = ln\nL K l=1 e qik l / \u221a d \u2212 1 L K L K j=1 q i k j / \u221a d \u2212 ln L K .\nDropping the constant, we define the i-th query's sparsity measurement as\nM (q i , K) = ln L K j=1 e q i k j \u221a d \u2212 1 L K L K j=1 q i k j \u221a d ,(2)\nwhere the first term is the Log-Sum-Exp (LSE) of q i on all the keys, and the second term is the arithmetic mean on them. If the i-th query gains a larger M (q i , K), its attention probability p is more \"diverse\" and has a high chance to contain the dominate dot-product pairs in the header field of the long tail self-attention distribution.\nProbSparse Self-attention Based on the proposed measurement, we have the ProbSparse self-attention by allowing each key to only attend to the u dominant queries:\nA(Q, K, V) = Softmax( QK \u221a d )V ,(3)\nwhere Q is a sparse matrix of the same size of q and it only contains the Top-u queries under the sparsity measurement M (q, K). Controlled by a constant sampling factor c, we set u = c \u2022 ln L Q , which makes the ProbSparse selfattention only need to calculate O(ln L Q ) dot-product for each query-key lookup and the layer memory usage maintains O(L K ln L Q ). Under the multi-head perspective, this attention generates different sparse query-key pairs for each head, which avoids severe information loss in return. However, the traversing of all the queries for the measurement M (q i , K) requires calculating each dot-product pairs, i.e., quadratically O(L Q L K ), besides the LSE operation has the potential numerical stability issue. Motivated by this, we propose an empirical approximation for the efficient acquisition of the query sparsity measurement.\nLemma 1. For each query q i \u2208 R d and k j \u2208 R d in the keys set K, we have the bound as ln\nL K \u2264 M (q i , K) \u2264 max j {q i k j / \u221a d} \u2212 1 L K L K j=1 {q i k j / \u221a d} + ln L K . When q i \u2208 K, it also holds.\nFrom the Lemma 1 (proof is given in Appendix D.1), we propose the max-mean measurement as\nM (q i , K) = max j { q i k j \u221a d } \u2212 1 L K L K j=1 q i k j \u221a d .(4)\nThe range of Top-u approximately holds in the boundary relaxation with Proposition 1 (refers in Appendix D.2). Under the long tail distribution, we only need to randomly sample U = L K ln L Q dot-product pairs to calculate the M (q i , K), i.e., filling other pairs with zero. Then, we select sparse Top-u from them as Q. The max-operator in M (q i , K) is less sensitive to zero values and is numerical stable. In practice, the input length of queries and keys are typically equivalent in the self-attention computation, i.e L Q = L K = L such that the total ProbSparse self-attention time complexity and space complexity are O(L ln L).  2) The presented one is the main stack receiving the whole input sequence. Then the second stack takes half slices of the input, and the subsequent stacks repeat. (3) The red layers are dot-product matrixes, and they get cascade decrease by applying self-attention distilling on each layer. (4) Concatenate all stacks' feature maps as the encoder's output.\nScalar Stamp T = t T = t + D x L d Conv1d L d Embedding + L k L n-heads Attention Block 1 Conv1d M a x P o o l 1 d , p a d d i n g = 2 L/2 k L / 2 n-heads Attention Block 2 Conv1d M a x P o o l 1 d , p a d d i n g = 2 L/4 k L / 4 n-heads Attention Block 3 L / 4 d Feature Map", "publication_ref": ["b48", "b46", "b11", "b24"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Encoder: Allowing for Processing Longer Sequential Inputs under the Memory Usage Limitation", "text": "The encoder is designed to extract the robust long-range dependency of the long sequential inputs. After the input representation, the t-th sequence input X t has been shaped into a matrix X t en \u2208 R Lx\u00d7dmodel . We give a sketch of the encoder in Fig. (3) for clarity.\nSelf-attention Distilling As the natural consequence of the ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, the encoder's feature map has redundant combinations of value V. We use the distilling operation to privilege the superior ones with dominating features and make a focused self-attention feature map in the next layer. It trims the input's time dimension sharply, seeing the n-heads weights matrix (overlapping red squares) of Attention blocks in Fig. (3). Inspired by the dilated convolution (Yu, Koltun, and Funkhouser 2017;Gupta and Rush 2017), our \"distilling\" procedure forwards from j-th layer into (j + 1)-th layer as:\nX t j+1 = MaxPool ELU( Conv1d([X t j ] AB ) ) ,(5)\nwhere [\u2022] AB represents the attention block. It contains the Multi-head ProbSparse self-attention and the essential operations, where Conv1d(\u2022) performs an 1-D convolutional filters (kernel width=3) on time dimension with the ELU(\u2022) activation function (Clevert, Unterthiner, and Hochreiter 2016). We add a max-pooling layer with stride 2 and downsample X t into its half slice after stacking a layer, which reduces the whole memory usage to be\nO((2 \u2212 )L log L),\nwhere is a small number. To enhance the robustness of the distilling operation, we build replicas of the main stack with halving inputs, and progressively decrease the number of self-attention distilling layers by dropping one layer at a time, like a pyramid in Fig.\n( 2), such that their output dimension is aligned. Thus, we concatenate all the stacks' outputs and have the final hidden representation of encoder.\nDecoder: Generating Long Sequential Outputs Through One Forward Procedure\nWe use a standard decoder structure (Vaswani et al. 2017) in Fig.\n(2), and it is composed of a stack of two identical multihead attention layers. However, the generative inference is employed to alleviate the speed plunge in long prediction.\nWe feed the decoder with the following vectors as Ltoken+Ly)\u00d7dmodel , (6) where X t token \u2208 R Ltoken\u00d7dmodel is the start token, X t 0 \u2208 R Ly\u00d7dmodel is a placeholder for the target sequence (set scalar as 0). Masked multi-head attention is applied in the ProbSparse self-attention computing by setting masked dotproducts to \u2212\u221e. It prevents each position from attending to coming positions, which avoids auto-regressive. A fully connected layer acquires the final output, and its outsize d y depends on whether we are performing a univariate forecasting or a multivariate one.\nX t de = Concat(X t token , X t 0 ) \u2208 R (\nGenerative Inference Start token is efficiently applied in NLP's \"dynamic decoding\" (Devlin et al. 2018), and we extend it into a generative way. Instead of choosing specific flags as the token, we sample a L token long sequence in the input sequence, such as an earlier slice before the output sequence. Take predicting 168 points as an example (7-day temperature prediction in the experiment section), we will take the known 5 days before the target sequence as \"starttoken\", and feed the generative-style inference decoder with X de = {X 5d , X 0 }. The X 0 contains target sequence's time stamp, i.e., the context at the target week. Then our proposed decoder predicts outputs by one forward procedure rather than the time consuming \"dynamic decoding\" in the conventional encoder-decoder architecture. A detailed performance comparison is given in the computation efficiency section.\nLoss function We choose the MSE loss function on prediction w.r.t the target sequences, and the loss is propagated back from the decoder's outputs across the entire model.

Classical time-series models serve as a reliable workhorse for time-series forecasting, with appealing properties such as interpretability and theoretical guarantees (Box et al. 2015;Ray 1990). Modern extensions include the support for missing data (Seeger et al. 2017) and multiple data types (Seeger, Salinas, and Flunkert 2016). Deep learning based methods mainly develop sequence to sequence prediction paradigm by using RNN and their variants, achieving ground-breaking performance (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997;Li et al. 2018;.

Typical state-of-the-art approaches (Seeger et al. 2017;Seeger, Salinas, and Flunkert 2016), especially deep-learning methods Qin et al. 2017;Flunkert, Salinas, and Gasthaus 2017;Mukherjee et al. 2018;Wen et al. 2017), remain as a sequence to sequence prediction paradigm with step-by-step process, which have the following limitations: (i) Even though they may achieve accurate prediction for one step forward, they often suffer from accumulated error from the dynamic decoding, resulting in the large errors for LSTF problem (Liu et al. 2019;Qin et al. 2017). The prediction accuracy decays along with the increase of the predicted sequence length. (ii) Due to the problem of vanishing gradient and memory constraint (Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le 2014), most existing methods cannot learn from the past behavior of the whole history of the time-series. In our work, the Informer is designed to address this two limitations.\nLong sequence input problem From the above discussion, we refer to the second limitation as to the long sequence time-series input (LSTI) problem. We will explore related works and draw a comparison between our LSTF problem. The researchers truncate / summarize / sample the input sequence to handle a very long sequence in practice, but valuable data may be lost in making accurate predictions. Instead of modifying inputs, Truncated BPTT (Aicher, Foti, and Fox 2019) only uses last time steps to estimate the gradients in weight updates, and Auxiliary Losses (Trinh et al. 2018) enhance the gradients flow by adding auxiliary gradients. Other attempts includes Recurrent Highway Networks (Zilly et al. 2017) and Bootstrapping Regularizer (Cao and Xu 2019). Theses methods try to improve the gradient flows in the recurrent network's long path, but the performance is limited with the sequence length growing in the LSTI problem. CNN-based methods (Stoller et al. 2019;Bai, Kolter, and Koltun 2018) use the convolutional filter to capture the long term dependency, and their receptive fields grow exponentially with the stacking of layers, which hurts the sequence alignment. In the LSTI problem, the main task is to enhance the model's capacity of receiving long sequence in-puts and extract the long-range dependency from these inputs. But the LSTF problem seeks to enhance the model's prediction capacity of forecasting long sequence outputs, which requires establishing the long-range dependency between outputs and inputs. Thus, the above methods are not feasible for LSTF directly.\nAttention model Bahdanau et al. firstly proposed the addictive attention (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) to improve the word alignment of the encoder-decoder architecture in the translation task. Then, its variant (Luong, Pham, and Manning 2015) has proposed the widely used location, general, and dot-product attention. The popular selfattention based Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) has recently been proposed as new thinking of sequence modeling and has achieved great success, especially in the NLP field. The ability of better sequence alignment has been validated by applying it to translation, speech, music, and image generation. In our work, the Informer takes advantage of its sequence alignment ability and makes it amenable to the LSTF problem.\nTransformer-based time-series model The most related works (Song et al. 2018;Ma et al. 2019;Li et al. 2019) all start from a trail on applying Transformer in time-series data and fail in LSTF forecasting as they use the vanilla Transformer. And some other works (Child et al. 2019;Li et al. 2019) noticed the sparsity in self-attention mechanism and we have discussed them in the main context. computation can have access to global context and the computation consuming is affordable on long inputs. To align the dimension, we project the scalar context x t i into d model -dim vector u t i with 1-D convolutional filters (kernel width=3, stride=1). Thus, we have the feeding vector\nX t feed[i] = \u03b1u t i +PE (Lx\u00d7(t\u22121)+i, ) + p [SE (Lx\u00d7(t\u22121)+i) ]p ,(8)\nwhere i \u2208 {1, . . . , L x }, and \u03b1 is the factor balancing the magnitude between the scalar projection and local/global embeddings. We recommend \u03b1 = 1 if the sequence input has been normalized.\nPosition Embeddings\nP E0 P E1 P E2 P E3 P E4 P E5 P E6 P E7\nProjection u 0 u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 u 5 u 6 u 7", "publication_ref": ["b6", "b36", "b39", "b40", "b21", "b25", "b39", "b40", "b33", "b18", "b31", "b51", "b26", "b33", "b43", "b0", "b45", "b55", "b9", "b42", "b3", "b2", "b28", "b48", "b41", "b29", "b24", "b11", "b24"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Week Embeddings", "text": "Week E0\nWeek E1", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Month Embeddings", "text": "Month E0", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Holiday Embeddings", "text": "Week E2\nWeek Appendix C The long tail distribution in self-attention feature map\nE3 E0 E0 E0 H1 E1 E0 E0 H2 E2H2\nWe have performed the vanilla Transformer on the ETTh 1 dataset to investigate the distribution of self-attention feature map. We select the attention score of {Head1,Head7} @ Layer1. The blue line in Fig.( 7) forms a long tail distribution, i.e. a few dot-product pairs contribute to the major attention and others can be ignored. Proof. For the individual q i , we can relax the discrete keys into the continuous d-dimensional variable, i.e. vector k j . The query sparsity measurement is defined as the M (q i , K) = ln\nL K j=1 e qik j / \u221a d \u2212 1 L K L K j=1 (q i k j / \u221a d).\nFirstly, we look into the left part of the inequality. For each query q i , the first term of the M (q i , K) becomes the log-sum-exp of the inner-product of a fixed query q i and all the keys , and we can define f i (K) = ln\nL K j=1 e qik j / \u221a d .\nFrom the Eq.(2) in the Log-sum-exp network (Calafiore, Gaubert, and Possieri 2018) and the further analysis, the function f i (K) is convex. Moreover, f i (K) add a linear combination of k j makes the M (q i , K) to be the convex function for a fixed query. Then we can take the derivation of the measurement with respect to the individual vector k j as \u2202M (qi,K)\n\u2202kj = e q i k j / \u221a d L K j=1 e q i k j / \u221a d \u2022 qi \u221a d \u2212 1 L K \u2022 qi \u221a d .\nTo reach the minimum value, we let \u2207M (q i ) = 0 and the following condition is acquired as\nq i k 1 + ln L K = \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 = q i k j + ln L K = \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 = ln L K\nj=1 e qik j . Naturally, it requires k 1 = k 2 = \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 = k L K , and we have the measurement's minimum as ln L K , i.e.\nM (q i , K) \u2265 ln L K .(9)\nSecondly, we look into the right part of the inequality. If we select the largest inner-product max\nj {q i k j / \u221a d}, it is easy that M (qi, K) = ln L K j=1 e q i k j \u221a d \u2212 1 LK L K j=1 ( qik j \u221a d ) \u2264 ln(LK \u2022max j { qik j \u221a d })\u2212 1 LK L K j=1 ( qik j \u221a d ) = ln LK +max j { qik j \u221a d }\u2212 1 LK L K j=1 ( qik j \u221a d ) .(10)\nCombine the Eq.( 14) and Eq.( 15), we have the results of Lemma 1. When the key set is the same with the query set, the above discussion also holds. Proposition 1. Assuming k j \u223c N (\u00b5, \u03a3) and we let qk i denote set\n{(q i k j )/ \u221a d | j = 1, . . . , L K }, then \u2200M m = max i M (q i , K) there exist \u03ba > 0 such that: in the interval \u2200q 1 , q 2 \u2208 {q|M (q, K) \u2208 [M m , M m \u2212 \u03ba)}, if M (q 1 , K) > M (q 2 , K)\nand Var(qk 1 ) > Var(qk 2 ), we have high probability that M (q 1 , K) > M (q 2 , K).", "publication_ref": ["b8"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Proof of Proposition 1", "text": "Proof. To make the further discussion simplify, we can note a i,j = q i k T j / \u221a d, thus define the ar-\nray A i = [a i,1 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , a i,L k ]. Moreover, we denote 1 L K L K j=1 (q i k j / \u221a d) = mean(A i ), then we can denot\u0113 M (q i , K) = max(A i ) \u2212 mean(A i ), i = 1, 2.\nAs for M (q i , K), we denote each component a i,j = mean(A i ) + \u2206a i,j , j = 1, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , L k , then we have the following:\nM (q i , K) = ln L K j=1 e qik j / \u221a d \u2212 1 L K L K j=1 (q i k j / \u221a d)\n= ln(\u03a3 L k j=1 e mean(Ai) e \u2206ai,j ) \u2212 mean(A i ) = ln(e mean(Ai) \u03a3 L k j=1 e \u2206ai,j ) \u2212 mean(A i ) = ln(\u03a3 L k j=1 e \u2206ai,j ) , and it is easy to find \u03a3 L k j=1 \u2206a i,j = 0. We define the function ES(A i ) = \u03a3 L k j=1 exp(\u2206a i,j ), equivalently defines A i = [\u2206a i,1 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , \u2206a i,L k ], and immediately our proposition can be written as the equivalent form:\nFor \u2200A 1 , A 2 , if 1. max(A 1 ) \u2212 mean(A 1 ) \u2265 max(A 2 ) \u2212 mean(A 2 ) 2. Var(A 1 ) > Var(A 2 ) Then we rephrase the original conclusion into more general form that ES(A 1 ) > ES(A 2 ) with high probability, and the probability have positive correlation with Var(A 1 ) \u2212 Var(A 2 ).\nFurthermore, we consider a fine case, \u2200M m = max i M (q i , K) there exist \u03ba > 0 such that in that interval\n\u2200q i , q j \u2208 {q|M (q, K) \u2208 [M m , M m \u2212 \u03ba)} if max(A 1 ) \u2212 mean(A 1 ) \u2265 max(A 2 ) \u2212 mean(A 2 ) and Var(A 1 ) > Var(A 2 ), we have high probability that M (q 1 , K) > M (q 2 , K),which is equivalent to ES(A 1 ) > ES(A 2 ).\nIn the original proposition, k j \u223c N (\u00b5, \u03a3) follows multivariate Gaussian distribution, which means that k 1 , \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , k n are I.I.D Gaussian distribution, thus defined by the Wienerkhinchin law of large Numbers, a i,j = q i k T j / \u221a d is onedimension Gaussian distribution with the expectation of 0 if n \u2192 \u221e. So back to our definition, \u2206a 1,m \u223c N (0, \u03c3 2 1 ), \u2206a 2,m \u223c N (0, \u03c3 2 2 ), \u2200m \u2208 1, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , L k , and our proposition is equivalent to a lognormal-distribution sum problem.\nA lognormal-distribution sum problem is equivalent to approximating the distribution of ES(A 1 ) accurately, whose history is well-introduced in the articles (Dufresne 2008), (Vargasguzman 2005). Approximating lognormality of sums of lognormals is a well-known rule of thumb, and no general PDF function can be given for the sums of lognormals. However, (Romeo, Da Costa, and Bardou 2003) and (Hcine and Bouallegue 2015) pointed out that in most cases, sums of lognormals is still a lognormal distribution, and by applying central limits theorem in (Beaulieu 2011), we can have a good approximation that ES(A 1 ) is a lognormal distribution, and we have E(ES(A\n1 )) = ne \u03c3 2 1 2 , Var(ES(A 1 )) = ne \u03c3 2 1 (e \u03c3 2 1 \u2212 1). Equally, E(ES(A 2 )) = ne \u03c3 2 2\n2 , Var(ES(A 2 )) = ne \u03c3 2 2 (e \u03c3 2 2 \u2212 1). We denote B 1 = ES(A 1 ), B 2 = ES(A 2 ), and the probability P r(B 1 \u2212 B 2 > 0) is the final result of our proposition in general conditions, with \u03c3 2 1 > \u03c3 2 2 WLOG. The difference of lognormals is still a hard problem to solve. By using the theorem given in (Lo 2012), which gives a general approximation of the probability distribution on the sums and difference for the lognormal distribution. Namely S 1 and S 2 are two lognormal stochastic variables obeying the stochastic differential equations dSi Si = \u03c3 i dZ i , i = 1, 2, in which dZ 1,2 presents a standard Weiner process associated with S 1,2 respectively, and \u03c3 2 i = Var (ln S i ), S \u00b1 \u2261 S 1 \u00b1 S 2 ,S \u00b1 0 \u2261 S 10 \u00b1 S 20 . As for the joint probability distribution function P (S 1 , S 2 , t; S 10 , S 20 , t 0 ), the value of S 1 and S 2 at time t > t 0 are provided by their initial value S 10 and S 20 at initial time t 0 . The Weiner process above is equivalent to the lognormal distribution (Weiner and Solbrig 1984), and the conclusion below is written in general form containing both the sum and difference of lognormal distribution approximation denoting \u00b1 for sum + and difference \u2212 respectively.\nIn boundary condition P \u00b1 S \u00b1 , t; S 10 , S 20 , t 0 \u2212\u2192 t = \u03b4 S 10 \u00b1 S 20 \u2212 S \u00b1 , their closed-form probability distribution functions are given by\nf LN S \u00b1 , t;S \u00b1 0 , t 0 = 1 S \u00b1 2\u03c0\u03c3 2 \u00b1 (t \u2212 t 0 ) \u2022 exp \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 \u2212 ln S + /S + 0 + (1/2)\u03c3 2 \u00b1 (t \u2212 t 0 ) 2 2\u03c3 2 \u00b1 (t \u2212 t 0 ) \uf8fc \uf8f4 \uf8fd \uf8f4 \uf8fe .\nIt is an approximately normal distribution, andS + ,S \u2212 are lognormal random variables,S \u00b1 0 are initial condition in t 0 defined by Weiner process above. (Noticed that\u03c3 2 \u00b1 (t \u2212 t 0 ) should be small to make this approximation valid.In our simulation experiment, we set t \u2212 t 0 = 1 WLOG.) Since\nS \u2212 0 = (S 10 \u2212 S 20 ) + \u03c3 2 \u2212 \u03c3 2 1 \u2212 \u03c3 2 2 (S 10 + S 20 ), and\u03c3 \u2212 = \u03c3 2 1 \u2212 \u03c3 2 2 / (2\u03c3 \u2212 ) \u03c3 \u2212 = \u03c3 2 1 + \u03c3 2 2\nNoticed that E(B 1 ) > E(B 2 ), Var(B 1 ) > Var(B 2 ), the mean value and the variance of the approximate normal distribution shows positive correlation with \u03c3 2 1 \u2212 \u03c3 2 2 .Besides, the closed-form PDF f LN S \u00b1 , t;S \u00b1 0 , t 0 also show positive correlation with \u03c3 2 1 \u2212 \u03c3 2 2 . Due to the limitation of \u03c3 2 \u00b1 (t \u2212 t 0 ) should be small enough, such positive correlation is not significant in our illustrative numerical experiment.\nBy using Lie-Trotter Operator Splitting Method in (Lo 2012), we can give illustrative numeral examples for the distribution of B 1 \u2212 B 2 ,in which the parameters are well chosen to fit for our top-u approximation in actual LLLT experiments. Figure shows that it is of high probability that when \u03c3 2 1 > \u03c3 2 2 , the inequality holds that B 1 > B 2 , ES(A 1 ) > ES(A 2 ).\nFinishing prooving our proposition in general conditions, we can consider a more specific condition that if q  8). In our actual LTTnet experiment, we choose Top-k of A 1 , A 2 , not the whole set.Actually, we can make a naive assumption that in choosing top \u2212 1 4 L k variables of A 1 , A 2 denoted as A 1 , A 2 ,the variation \u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 don't change significantly, but the expectation E(A 1 ), E(A 2 ) ascends obviously, which leads to initial condition S 10 , S 20 ascends significantly, since the initial condition will be sampled from top \u2212 1 4 L k variables, not the whole set.\n1 , q 2 \u2208 {q|M (q, K) \u2208 [M m , M m \u2212 \u03ba)},\nIn our actual LTTnet experiment, we set U , namely choosing around top \u2212 1 4 L k of A 1 and A 2 , it is guaranteed that with over 99% probability that in the [M m , M m \u2212 \u03ba) interval, as shown in the black curve of Fig. (8). Typically the condition 2 can be relaxed, and we can believe that if q 1 , q 2 fits the condition 1 in our proposition, we have M (q 1 , K) > M (q 2 , K).", "publication_ref": ["b17", "b47", "b37", "b20", "b4", "b27", "b50", "b27"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Appendix E Reproducibility", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Details of the experiments", "text": "The details of proposed Informer model is summarized in Table 7.
