To speed up Gibbs sampling, there has recently been interest in parallelizing it by executing asynchronously. While empirical results suggest that many models can be efficiently sampled asynchronously, traditional Markov chain analysis does not apply to the asynchronous case, and thus asynchronous Gibbs sampling is poorly understood.

In this setting, Gibbs sampling (Algorithm 1) operates iteratively by choosing at random a variable from the model at each timestep, and updating it by sampling from its conditional distribution given the other variables in the model. Often, it is applied to inference problems, in which we are trying to estimate the marginal probabilities of some query events in a given distribution.", "publication_ref": ["b10"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Algorithm 1 Gibbs sampling", "text": "Require: Variables x i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and distribution \u03c0.\nfor t = 1 to T do Sample s uniformly from {1, . . . , n}.\nRe-sample x s uniformly from P \u03c0 (X s |X {1,...,n}\\{s} ). end for For sparse graphical models, to which Gibbs sampling is often applied, each of these updates needs to read the values of only a small subset of the variables; therefore each update can be computed very quickly on modern hardware. Because of this and other useful properties of Gibbs sampling, many systems use Gibbs sampling to perform inference on big data [15,17,20,26,30,32].\nSince Gibbs sampling is such a ubiquitous algorithm, it is important to try to optimize its execution speed on modern hardware. Unfortunately, while modern computer hardware has been trending towards more parallel architectures [28], traditional Gibbs sampling is an inherently sequential algorithm; that is, the loop in Algorithm 1 is not directly parallelizable. Furthermore, for sparse models, very little work happens within each iteration, meaning it is difficult to extract much parallelism from the body of this loop. Since traditional Gibbs sampling parallelizes so poorly, it is interesting to study variants of Gibbs sampling that can be parallelized. Several such variants have been proposed, including applications to latent Dirichlet allocation [20,26] and distributed constraint optimization problems [21].\nIn one popular variant, multiple threads run the Gibbs sampling update rule in parallel without locks, a strategy called asynchronous or HOGWILD! execution-in this paper, we use these two terms interchangeably. This idea was proposed, but not analyzed theoretically, in Smola & Narayanamurthy [26], and has been shown to give empirically better results on many models [32]. But when can we be sure that HOGWILD! Gibbs sampling will produce accurate results? Except for the case of Gaussian random variables [10], there is no existing analysis by which we can ensure that asynchronous Gibbs sampling will be appropriate for a particular application. Even the problems posed by HOGWILD!-Gibbs are poorly understood, and their solutions more so.\nAs we will show in the following sections, there are two main issues when analyzing asynchronous Gibbs sampling. Firstly, we will show by example that, surprisingly, HOGWILD!-Gibbs can be biased-unlike sequential Gibbs, it does not always produce samples that are arbitrarily close to the target distribution. Secondly, we will show that the mixing time (the time for the chain to become close to its stationary distribution) of asynchronous Gibbs sampling can be up to exponentially greater than that of the corresponding sequential chain.\nTo address the issue of bias, we need some way to describe the distance between the target distribution \u03c0 and the distribution of the samples produced by HOGWILD!-Gibbs. The standard notion to use here is the total variation distance, but for the task of computing marginal probabilities, it gives an overestimate on the error caused by bias. To better describe the bias, we introduce a new notion of statistical distance, the sparse variation distance. While this relaxed notion of statistical distance is interesting in its own right, its main benefit here is that it uses a more local view of the chain to more tightly measure the effect of bias.\nOur main goal is to identify conditions under which the bias and mixing time of asynchronous Gibbs can be bounded. One parameter that has been used to great effect in the analysis of Gibbs sampling is the total influence \u03b1 of a model. The total influence measures the degree to which the marginal distribution of a variable can depend on the values of the other variables in the model-this parameter has appeared as part of a celebrated line of work on Dobrushin's condition (\u03b1 < 1), which ensures the rapid mixing of spin statistics systems [3,4,8]. It turns out that we can use this parameter to bound both the bias and mixing time of HOGWILD!-Gibbs, and so we make the following contributions:\n\u2022 We describe a way to statistically model the asynchronicity in HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling.\n\u2022 To bound the bias, we prove that for classes of models with bounded total influence \u03b1 = O(1), if sequential Gibbs sampling achieves small sparse variation distance to \u03c0 in O(n) steps, where n is the number of variables, then HOGWILD!-Gibbs samples achieve the same distance in at most O(1) more steps.\n\u2022 For models that satisfy Dobrushin's condition (that is, \u03b1 < 1), we show that the mixing time bounds of sequential and HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling differ only by a factor of 1 + O(n \u22121 ).\n\u2022 We validate our results experimentally and show that, by using asynchronous execution, we can achieve wallclock speedups of up to 2.8\u00d7 on real problems.", "publication_ref": ["b14", "b16", "b19", "b25", "b29", "b31", "b27", "b19", "b25", "b20", "b25", "b31", "b9", "b2", "b3", "b7"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "Much work has been done on the analysis of parallel Gibbs samplers. One simple way to parallelize Gibbs sampling is to run multiple chains independently in parallel: this heuristic uses parallelism to produce more samples overall, but does not produce accurate samples more quickly. Additionally, this strategy is sometimes worse than other strategies on a systems level [26,32], typically because it requires additional memory to maintain multiple models of the chain. Another strategy for parallelizing Gibbs sampling involves taking advantage of the structure of the underlying factor graph to run in parallel while still maintaining an execution pattern to which the standard sequential Gibbs sampling analysis can be applied [5]. Much further work has focused on parallelizing sampling for specific problems, such as LDA [20,26] and others [21].\nOur approach follows on the paper of Johnson et al. [10], which named the HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling algorithm and analyzed it for Gaussian models. Their main contribution is an analysis framework that includes a sufficient condition under which HOGWILD! Gaussian Gibbs samples are guaranteed to have the correct asymptotic mean. Recent work [29] has analyzed a similar algorithm under even stronger regularity conditions. Here, we seek to give more general results for the analysis of HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling on discrete-valued factor graphs.\nThe HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling algorithm was inspired by a line of work on parallelizing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by running it asynchronously. HOGWILD! SGD was first proposed by Niu et al. [22], who proved that while running without locks causes race conditions, they do not significantly impede the convergence of the algorithm. The asynchronous execution strategy has been applied to many problems-such as PageRank approximations [18], deep learning [23] and recommender systems [31]-so it is not surprising that it has been proposed for use with Gibbs sampling. Our goal in this paper is to combine analysis ideas that have been applied to Gibbs sampling and HOGWILD!, in order to characterize the behavior of asynchronous Gibbs. In particular, we are motivated by some recent work on the analysis of HOGWILD! for SGD [2,13,14,16]. Several of these results suggest modeling the race conditions inherent in HOGWILD! SGD as noise in a stochastic process; this lets them bring a trove of statistical techniques to bear on the analysis of HOGWILD! SGD. Therefore, in this paper, we will apply a similar stochastic process model to Gibbs sampling.\nSeveral recent papers have focused on the mixing time of Gibbs sampling based on the structural properties of the model. Gotovos et al. [6] and De Sa et al. [1] each show that Gibbs sampling mixes in polynomial time for a class of distributions bounded by some parameter. Unfortunately, these results both depend on spectral methods (that try to bound the spectral gap of the Markov transition matrix), which are difficult to apply to HOGWILD! Gibbs sampling for two reasons. First, spectral methods don't let us represent the sampler as a stochastic process, which limits the range of techniques we can use to model the noise. Secondly, while most spectral methods only apply to reversible Markov chains-and sequential Gibbs sampling is always a reversible chain-for HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling the asynchronicity and parallelism make the chain non-reversible. Because of this, we were unable to use these spectral results in our asynchronous setting. We are forced to rely on the other method [7] for analyzing Markov processes, coupling-the type of analysis used with the Dobrushin condition-which we will describe in the following sections.", "publication_ref": ["b25", "b31", "b4", "b19", "b25", "b20", "b9", "b28", "b21", "b17", "b22", "b30", "b1", "b12", "b13", "b15", "b5", "b0", "b6"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Modeling Asynchronicity", "text": "In this section, we describe a statistical model for asynchronous Gibbs sampling by adapting the hardware model outlined in De Sa et al. [2]. Because we are motivated by the factor graph inference problem, we will focus on the case where the distribution \u03c0 that we want to sample comes from a sparse, discrete graphical model.\nAny HOGWILD!-Gibbs implementation involves some number of threads each repeatedly executing the Gibbs update rule on a single copy of the model (typically stored in RAM). We assume that this model serializes all writes, such that we can speak of the state of the system after t writes have occurred. We call this time t, and we will model the HOGWILD! system as a stochastic process adapted to the natural filtration F t . Here, F t contains all events that have occurred up to time t, and we say an event is F t measurable if it is known deterministically by time t.\nWe begin our construction by letting x i,t denote the (F t measurable) value of variable i at time t, and letting\u0128 t be the (F t+1 measurable) index of the variable that we choose to sample at time t. For Gibbs sampling, we have \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, P \u0128 t = i F t = 1 n ;\nthis represents the fact that we have an equal probability of sampling each variable. Now that we have defined which variables are to be sampled, we proceed to describe how they are sampled. For HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling, we must model the fact that the sampler does not get to use exactly the values of x i,t ; rather it has access to a cache containing potentially stale values. To do this, we define (F t+1 measurable) v i,t = x i,t\u2212\u03c4i,t , where\u03c4 i,t \u2265 0 is a delay parameter (F t+1 measurable and independent of\u0128 t ) that represents how old the currently-cached value for variable i could be. A variable resampled using this stale data would have distribution\nP (z i,t = z|F t ) \u221d \u03c0(\u1e7d 1,t , . . . ,\u1e7d i\u22121,t , z,\u1e7d i+1,t , . . . ,\u1e7d n,t ).\nUsing this, we can relate the values of the variables across time with\nx i,t+1 = z i,t if i =\u0128 t x i,t otherwise.\nSo far, our model is incompletely specified, because we have not described the distribution of the delays\u03c4 i,t . Unfortunately, since these delays depend on the number of threads and the specifics of the hardware [22], their distribution is difficult to measure. Instead of specifying a particular distribution, we require only a bound on the expected delay, E [\u03c4 i,t |F t ] \u2264 \u03c4 . In this model, the \u03c4 parameter represents everything that is relevant about the hardware; representing the hardware in this way has been successful for the analysis of asynchronous SGD [22], so it is reasonable to use it for Gibbs sampling. In addition to this, we will need a similar parameter that bounds the tails of\u03c4 i,t slightly more aggressively. We require that for some parameter \u03c4 * , and for all i and t,\nE exp n \u22121\u03c4 i,t F t \u2264 1 + n \u22121 \u03c4 * .\nThis parameter is typically very close to the expected value bound \u03c4 ; in particular, as n approaches infinity, \u03c4 * approaches \u03c4 .", "publication_ref": ["b1", "b21", "b21"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "The First Challenge: Bias", "text": "Perhaps the most basic result about sequential Gibbs sampling is the fact that, in the limit of large numbers of samples, it is unbiased. In order to measure convergence of Markov chains to their stationary distribution, it is standard to use the total variation distance.\nDefinition 1 (Total Variation Distance). The total variation distance [12, p. 48] between two probability measures \u00b5 and \u03bd on probability space \u2126 is defined as\n\u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd TV = max A\u2282\u2126 |\u00b5(A) \u2212 \u03bd(A)| ,\nthat is, the maximum difference between the probabilities that \u00b5 and \u03bd assign to a single event A.\nIt is a well-known result that, for Gibbs sampling on a strictly-positive target distribution \u03c0, it will hold that\nlim t\u2192\u221e P (t) \u00b5 0 \u2212 \u03c0 TV = 0,(1)\nwhere P (t) \u00b5 0 denotes the distribution of the t-th sample.\nOne of the difficulties that arises when applying HOGWILD! to Gibbs sampling is that the race conditions from the asynchronous execution add bias to the samples -Equation 1 no longer holds. To understand why, we can consider a simple example.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Bias Example", "text": "Consider a simple model with two variables X 1 and X 2 each taking on values in {0, 1}, and having distribution Sequential Gibbs sampling on this model will produce unbiased samples from the target distribution. Unfortunately, this is not the case if we run HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling on this model. Assume that the state is currently (1, 1) and two threads, T 1 and T 2 , simultaneously update X 1 and X 2 respectively. Since T 1 reads state (1, 1) it will update X 1 to 0 or 1 each with probability 0.5; the same will be true for T 2 and X 2 . Therefore, after this happens, every state will have probability 0.25; this includes the state (0, 0) which should never occur! Over time, this race condition will produce samples with value (0, 0) with some non-zero frequency; this is an example of bias introduced by the HOGWILD! sampling. Worse, this bias is not just theoretical: Figure 2 illustrates how the measured distribution for this model is affected by two-thread asynchronous execution. In particular, we observe that almost 5% of the mass is erroneously measured to be in the state (0, 0), which has no mass at all in the true distribution. The total variation distance to the target distribution is quite large at 9.8%, and, unlike in the sequential case, this bias doesn't disappear as the number of samples goes to infinity. \np(0, 1) = p(1, 0) = p(1, 1) = 1 3 p(0, 0) = 0.

Instead, the samples may approach some other distribution, which we hope is sufficiently similar for some practical purpose. Often, the purpose of Gibbs sampling is to estimate the marginal distributions of individual variables or of events that each depend on only a small number of variables in the model. To characterize the accuracy of these estimates, the total variation distance is too conservative: it depends on the difference over all the events in the space, when most of these are events that we do not care about. To address this, we introduce the following definition.\nDefinition 2 (Sparse Variation Distance). For any event A in a probability space \u2126 over a set of variables V , let |A| denote the number of variables upon which A depends. Then, for any two distributions \u00b5 and \u03bd over \u2126, we define the \u03c9-sparse variation distance to be \u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd SV(\u03c9) = max |A|\u2264\u03c9 |\u00b5(A) \u2212 \u03bd(A)| .\nFor the wide variety of applications that use sampling for marginal estimation, the sparse variation distance measures the quantity we actually care about: the maximum possible bias in the marginal distribution of the samples. As we will show, asynchronous execution seems to have less effect on the sparse variation distance than the total variation distance, because sparse variation distance uses a more localized view of the chain. For example, in Figure 2, the total variation distance between the sequential and HOGWILD! distributions is 9.8%, while the 1-sparse variation distance is only 0.4%. That is, while HOGWILD! execution does introduce great bias into the distribution, it still estimates marginals of the individual variables accurately.\nThis definition suggests the question: how long do we have to run before our samples have low sparse variation distance from the target distribution? To answer this question, we introduce the following definition.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": ["fig_1"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Definition 3 (Sparse Estimation Time", "text": "). The \u03c9-sparse estimation time of a stochastic sampler with distribution P (t) \u00b5 0 at time t and target distribution \u03c0 is the first time t at which, for any initial distribution \u00b5 0 , the estimated distribution is within sparse variation distance \u01eb of \u03c0,\nt SE(\u03c9) (\u01eb) = min{t \u2208 N | \u2200\u00b5 0 , P (t) \u00b5 0 \u2212 \u03c0 SV(\u03c9) \u2264 \u01eb}.\nIn many practical systems [19,25], Gibbs sampling is used without a proof that it works; instead, it is naively run for some fixed number of passes through the dataset. This naive strategy works for models for which accurate marginal estimates can be achieved after O(n) samples. This O(n) runtime is necessary for Gibbs sampling to be feasible on big data, meaning roughly that these are the models which it is interesting to try to speed up using asynchronous execution. Therefore, for the rest of this section, we will focus on the bias of the HOGWILD! chain for this class of models. When analyzing Gibbs sampling, we can bound the bias within the context of a coupling argument using a parameter called the total influence. While we arrived at this condition independently, it has been studied before, especially in the context of Dobrushin's condition, which ensures rapid mixing of Gibbs sampling. Definition 4 (Total Influence). Let \u03c0 be a probability distribution over some set of variables I. Let B j be the set of state pairs (X, Y ) which differ only at variable j. Let \u03c0 i (\u2022|X I\\{i} ) denote the conditional distribution in \u03c0 of variable i given all the other variables in state X. Then, define \u03b1, the total influence of \u03c0, as\n\u03b1 = max i\u2208I j\u2208I max (X,Y )\u2208Bj \u03c0 i (\u2022|X I\\{i} ) \u2212 \u03c0 i (\u2022|Y I\\{i} ) TV .\nWe say the model satisfies Dobrushin's condition if \u03b1 < 1.\nOne way to think of total influence for factor graphs is as a generalization of maximum degree; indeed, if a factor graph has maximum degree \u2206, it can easily be shown that \u03b1 \u2264 \u2206. It turns out that if we can bound both this parameter and the sparse estimation time of sequential Gibbs sampling, we can give a simple bound on the sparse estimation time for asynchronous Gibbs sampling. Claim 1. Assume that we have a class of distributions with bounded total influence \u03b1 = O(1). For each distribution \u03c0 in the class, lett SE\u2212seq(\u03c9) (\u03c0, \u01eb) be an upper bound on the \u03c9-sparse estimation time of its sequential Gibbs sampler, and assume that it is a convex, decreasing function of \u01eb. Further assume that, for any \u01eb, across all models,\nt SE\u2212seq(\u03c9) (\u03c0, \u01eb) = O(n),\nwhere n is the number of variables in the model. Then, for any \u01eb, the sparse estimation time of HOGWILD!-Gibbs across all models is bounded by\nt SE\u2212hog(\u03c9) (\u03c0, \u01eb) \u2264t SE\u2212seq(\u03c9) (\u03c0, \u01eb) + O(1).\nRoughly, this means that HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling \"works\" on all problems for which we know marginal estimation is \"fast\" and the total influence is bounded. Since the sparse estimation times here are measured in iterations, and the asynchronous sampler is able, due to parallelism, to run many more iterations in the same amount of wall clock time, this result implies that HOGWILD!-Gibbs can be much faster than sequential Gibbs for producing estimates of similar quality. To prove Claim 1, and more explicitly bound the bias, we use the following lemma.", "publication_ref": ["b18", "b24"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Lemma 1.", "text": "Assume that we run HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling on a distribution \u03c0 with total influence \u03b1.

When t = O(n), this bias is O(n \u22121 ), which has an intuitive explanation: for HOGWILD! execution, race conditions occur about once every \u0398(n) iterations, so the bias is roughly proportional to the frequency of race conditions. This gives us a relationship between the statistical error of the algorithm and a more traditional notion of computational error.\nUp until now, we have been assuming that we have a class for which the sparse estimation time is O(n). Using the total influence \u03b1, we can identify a class of models known to meet this criterion. Theorem 1. For any distribution that satisfies Dobrushin's condition, \u03b1 < 1, the \u03c9-sparse estimation time of the sequential Gibbs sampling process will be bounded by\nt SE\u2212seq(\u03c9) (\u01eb) \u2264 n 1 \u2212 \u03b1 log \u03c9 \u01eb .\nThis surprising result says that, in order to produce good marginal estimates for any model that satisfies Dobrushin's condition, we need only O(n) samples! While we could now use Lemma 1 to bound the sparse estimation time for HOGWILD!-Gibbs, a more direct analysis produces a slightly better result, which we present here. Theorem 2.

The resulting distribution will be almost uniform over all states with 1 T X \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. To this model, we add another bank of variables Y 1 , . . . , Y N all in {\u22121, 1}. These variables also have a single associated factor with energy\n\u03c6 Y (X, Y ) = \u03b2 N 1 T Y 2 if 1 T X = 1 M 2 1 T Y 2 if 1 T X > 1 ,\nfor parameters \u03b2 and M 2 .

Roughly, the X dynamics are constructed to regularly \"generate\" race conditions, while the Y dynamics are chosen to \"detect\" these race conditions and mix very slowly as a result. This model is illustrated in Figure 3. We simulated two-thread HOGWILD!-Gibbs on this model, measuring the marginal probability that 1 T Y > 0; by symmetry, this event has probability 0.5 in the stationary distribution for both the sequential and asynchronous samplers. Our results, for a model with N = 2001, \u03b2 = 0.3, M 1 = 10 10 , and M 2 = 100, and initial state X = Y = 1, are plotted in Figure 4. Notice that, while the sequential sampler achieves the correct marginal probability relatively quickly, the asynchronous samplers take a much longer time to achieve the correct result, even for a relatively small expected delay (\u03c4 = 0.5). These results suggest that something catastrophic is happening to the mixing time when we switch from sequential to asynchronous execution -and in fact we can prove this is the case. The intuition behind this statement is that for sequential Gibbs, the dynamics of the X part of the chain quickly causes it to have 1 T X = 1, and then remain there for the remainder of the simulation with high probability. This in turn causes the energy of the \u03c6 Y factor to be essentially \u03b2 N (1 T Y ) 2 , a model which is known to be fast-mixing because it satisfies Dobrushin's condition. On the other hand, for HOGWILD! Gibbs, due to race conditions we will see 1 T X = 1 with constant probability; this will cause the effective energy of the \u03c6 Y factor to be dominated by the M 2 (1 T Y ) 2 term, a model that is known to take exponential time to mix.\n\u03c6 X X 1 X 2 X 3 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 X N \u03c6 Y Y 1 Y 2 Y 3 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Y N", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Bounding the Mixing Time", "text": "This example shows that fast mixing of the sequential sampler alone is not sufficient to guarantee fast mixing of the HOGWILD! chain.

We start by introducing the idea of a coupling-based argument [12, p. 64], which starts by constructing two copies of the same Markov chain, X andX, starting from different states but running together in the same probability space (i.e. using the same sources of randomness). For analyzing HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling, we share randomness by having both chains sample the same variable at each iteration and sample it such that the resulting values are maximally correlated-additionally both chains are subject to the same HOGWILD! delays \u03c4 i,t . At some random time, called the coupling time T c , the chains will become equal-regardless of their initial conditions. Using this, we can bound the mixing time with\nt mix (\u01eb) \u2264 min{t | P(T c > t) \u2264 \u01eb}.\nIn order to bound the probability that the chains are not equal at a particular time t, we focus on the quantity\n\u03c6 t = max i P X i,t =X i,t .(3)\nUnder the conditions of Theorem 3, we are able to bound this using the total influence parameter. From here, we notice that by the union bound, P(T c > t) \u2264 n\u03c6 t .

First, we examine the mixing time claims we made in Section 5. Specifically, we want to check whether increasing the expected delay parameter \u03c4 * actually increases the mixing time as predicted by Equation 2.  2) mixing time as \u03c4 increases for a synthetic Ising model graph (n = 1000, \u2206 = 3).\nTo do this, we simulated HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling running on a random synthetic Ising model graph of order n = 1000, degree \u2206 = 3, inverse temperature \u03b2 = 0.2, and prior weights E x = 0. This model has total influence \u03b1 \u2264 0.6, and Theorem 3 guarantees that it will mix rapidly. Unfortunately, the mixing time of a chain is difficult to calculate experimentally. While techniques such as coupling from the past [24] exist for estimating the mixing time, using these techniques in order to expose the (relatively small) dependence of the mixing time on \u03c4 proved to be computationally intractable.\nInstead, we use a technique called coupling to the future. We initialize two chains, X and Y , by setting all the variables in X 0 to 1 and all the variables in Y 0 to \u22121. We proceed by simulating a coupling between the two chains, and return the coupling time T c . Our estimate of the mixing time will then bet(\u01eb), where P(T c \u2265t(\u01eb)) = \u01eb.\nStatement 2. This experimental estimate is an upper bound for the mixing time. That is,t(\u01eb) \u2265 t mix (\u01eb).\nTo estimatet(\u01eb), we ran 10000 instances of the coupling experiment, and returned the sample estimate oft(1/4). To compare across a range of \u03c4 * , we selected the\u03c4 i,t to be independent and identically distributed according to the maximum-entropy distribution supported on {0, 1, . . . , 200} consistent with a particular assignment of \u03c4 * . The resulting estimates are plotted as the blue series in Figure 5. The red line represents the mixing time that would be predicted by naively applying Equation 2 using the estimate of the sequential mixing time as a starting point -we can see that it is a very good match for the experimental results. This experiment shows that, at least for one archetypal model, our theory accurately characterizes the behavior of HOGWILD! Gibbs sampling as the delay parameter \u03c4 * is changed, and that using HOGWILD!-Gibbs doesn't cause the model to catastrophically fail to mix.\nOf course, in order for HOGWILD!-Gibbs to be useful, it must also speed up the execution of Gibbs sampling on some practical models. It is already known that this is the case, as these types of algorithms been widely implemented in practice [26,27]. To further test this, we ran HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling on a real-world 11 GB Knowledge Base Population dataset (derived from the TAC-KBP challenge) using a machine with a single-socket, 18-core Xeon E7-8890 CPU and 1 TB RAM. As a comparison, we also ran a \"multi-model\" Gibbs sampler: this consists of multiple threads with a single execution of Gibbs sampling running independently in each thread. This sampler will produce the same number of samples as HOGWILD!-Gibbs, but will require more memory to store multiple copies of the model. Figure 6 reports the speedup, in terms of wall-clock time, achieved by HOGWILD!-Gibbs on this dataset. On this machine, we get speedups of up to 2.8\u00d7, although the program becomes memory-bandwidth bound at around 8 threads, and we see no significant speedup beyond this. With any number of workers, the run time of HOGWILD!-Gibbs is close to that of multi-model Gibbs, which illustrates that the additional cache contention caused by the HOGWILD! updates has little effect on the algorithm's performance.

For the example model described above, there exist parameters M 1 , M 2 , and \u03b2 (as a function of N ) such that the mixing time of sequential Gibbs sampling is O(N log N ) but the mixing time of HOGWILD!-Gibbs sampling, even with \u03c4 = O(1), can be exp(\u2126(N )).\nProof of Statement 1. We start out by proving that the model mixes rapidly in the sequential case. First, we assume that we select M 1 large enough that, even for potentially exponential run times, the dynamics of the chain are indistinguishable from the chain with M 1 = \u221e. In particular, this alternate chain will have the following properties:\n\u2022 The dynamics of the X part of the chain do not depend in any way on the value of Y .\n\u2022 If at any point, 1 T X > 1, whenever we sample an X variable, we will re-sample it if possible to decrease the value of 1 T X with probability 1.\n\u2022 As long as 1 T X = 1 at some point in time, this will remain true, and the dynamics of the X part of the chain will be those of the chain described in Lemma 8.\nWe assume that we choose M 1 large enough that these properties hold over all time windows discussed in this proof with high probability. Now, by the coupon collector's problem, after O(N log N ) timesteps, we have sampled all the variables with high probability. If we have sampled all the variables with high probability, then we will certainly have 1 T X = 1 with high probability.\nOnce we have 1 T X = 1, Lemma 8 ensures that, after O(N log N ) additional timesteps, the X part of the chain will be close to its stationary distribution.\nMeanwhile, while 1 T X = 1, the dynamics of the Y part of the chain are exactly Gibbs sampling over the model with energy\n\u03c6 Y (Y ) = \u03b2 N 1 T Y 2 .\nFor any \u03b2 < 1, this is known to mix in O(N log N ) time, since it satisfies Dobrushin's condition. Therefore, after O(N log N ) steps after we have 1 T X = 1, the Y part of the chain will also be close to its stationary distribution.\nSumming up the times for the above events gives us a total mixing time for this chain of\nt mix\u2212seq = O(N log N ).\nNext we prove that the model takes a potentially exponential time to mix in the asynchronous case. Assume here that our model of execution has two threads, which always either sample two X variables independently and asynchronously, or sample a single Y variable synchronously (i.e. there is never any delay when reading the value of a Y variable). For this execution pattern, we have uniformly that \u03c4 i,t \u2264 1. In particular, this has \u03c4 = O(1). Now, consider the case where the two threads each choose to sample a variable in X that can be switched. Since at least 1 4 of the variables are variables in X that can be switched, this will occur with probability at least 1 16 . Given this, they will each independently switch their variable with probability 1 2 . This means that both variables are switched with probability 1 4 -but this would place the system in a state where\n1 T X > 1.\nAt any time when 1 T X = 1, this will occur with probability 1 64 , which implies that whenever we sample Y , the probability that 1 T X > 1 is at least 1 64 . Now, assume without loss of generality that we initialize Y such that 1 T Y = N . Let \u03c1 t denote the value of 1 T Y at time t. Assuming that we sample a variable Y i with value 1, while 1 T X = 1, the probability that it will be switched will be\nP (value switched) = exp \u03b2n \u22121 (\u03c1 t \u2212 1) 2 exp (\u03b2n \u22121 (\u03c1 t \u2212 1) 2 ) + exp (\u03b2n \u22121 (\u03c1 t ) 2 ) = 1 + exp \u03b2n \u22121 (\u03c1 t ) 2 \u2212 (\u03c1 t \u2212 1) 2 \u22121 = 1 + exp \u03b2n \u22121 (2\u03c1 t \u2212 1) \u22121 .\nNote that since \u03c1 t \u2264 N at all times, if \u03b2 < 1,\n\u03b2N \u22121 (2\u03c1 t \u2212 1) \u2264 2.\nWe also can verify that, for any 0 \u2264 x \u2264 2, as a basic property of the exponential function,\n(1 + exp(x)) \u22121 \u2264 1 2 \u2212 x 6 .\nTherefore, as long as \u03c1 t > 0,\nP (value switched) \u2264 1 2 \u2212 \u03b2\u03c1 t 3n .\nTherefore, as long as \u03c1 t > 0, and\n1 T X = 1, E [\u03c1 t+1 |F t ] \u2265 \u03c1 t + 2 N \u2212 \u03c1 t 2N \u2212 1 2 + \u03b2\u03c1 t 3N = \u03c1 t + 2 \u2212\u03c1 t 2N + \u03b2\u03c1 t 3N = \u03c1 t 1 \u2212 3 \u2212 2\u03b2 3N .\nOn the other hand, if 1 T X > 1, then we can pick M 2 large enough such that with high probability, as long as \u03c1 t > 0, all variables Y i are always sampled to be 1. In this case,\nE [\u03c1 t+1 |F t ] \u2265 \u03c1 t + 2 N \u2212 \u03c1 t 2N = \u03c1 t 1 \u2212 1 N + 1.\nIn general, since 1 T X > 1 with probability at least 1 64 ,\nE [\u03c1 t+1 |F t ] \u2265 1 \u2212 1 64 \u03c1 t 1 \u2212 3 \u2212 2\u03b2 3N + 1 64 \u03c1 t 1 \u2212 1 N + 1 = \u03c1 t 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 1 64 3 \u2212 2\u03b2 3N \u2212 1 64N + 1 64 = \u03c1 t 1 \u2212 1 N + 1 \u2212 1 64 2\u03b2 3N + 1 64 \u2265 \u03c1 t 1 \u2212 1 N + 1 64\nThis expression has fixed point\n\u03c1 * = N 64 .\nSince \u03c1 is written as a sum of independent samples, as long as \u03c1 > 0, the distribution of \u03c1 is going to be exponentially concentrated around its expected value, which we have just shown is at least N 64 . It follows that it is exponentially unlikely to ever achieve a value of \u03c1 that is not positive. By the union bound, there is some t = exp(\u2126(N )) such that, after t timesteps, \u03c1 t > 0 with high probability.\nBut, the actual probability that \u03c1 > 0 in the stationary distribution is exactly 1 2 , by symmetry. It follows that the mixing time for the HOGWILD! chain must be greater than t; that is, t mix\u2212hog \u2265 exp(\u2126(N )).\nThis finishes our proof of the statement.\nNext, we restate and prove Theorem 3.\nTheorem 3.

By Proposition 1, since X t has distribution P (t) \u00b5 0 and Y t has distribution P (t) \u03c0, this is equivalent to saying\nP (t) \u00b5 0 \u2212 P (t) \u03c0 TV \u2264 n exp \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1 n + \u03b1\u03c4 * t .\nTherefore, in order for\nP (t) \u00b5 0 \u2212 P (t) \u03c0 TV \u2264 \u01eb, it suffices to choose t such that \u01eb = n exp \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1 n + \u03b1\u03c4 * t .\nThis occurs when\nt = n + \u03b1\u03c4 * 1 \u2212 \u03b1 log n \u01eb ,\nwhich is the desired expression.\nNext, we restate and prove Statement 2, which says that our experimental strategy provides a valid upper bound on the mixing time.\nStatement 2.

At time t, let\u0168 t denote the state that would be read by chain X's sampler based on the delays, and similarly let\u1e7c t denote the state that would be read by chain Y 's sampler.

As in the sequential case, we sample the selected variable in both chains using the optimal coupling (of the conditional distributions of the variable to be sampled in both chains) guaranteed by Proposition 1. Iterated over time, this defines a full coupling of the two chains.\nWe follow the same argument as in the sequential case. First, consider the event that X i,t+1 = Y i,t+1 . This event will occur if one of two things happens: either we didn't sample variable i at time t and X i,t = Y i,t ; or we did sample variable i at time t, and the sampled variables were not equal. Since the probability of sampling variable i is 1 n , and we know the probability that the sampled variables were not equal from Proposition 1, it follows that, by the law of total probability,\nP (X i,t+1 = Y i,t+1 ) = 1 \u2212 1 n P (X i,t = Y i,t ) + 1 n E \u03c0 i (\u2022|\u0168 t ) \u2212 \u03c0 i (\u2022|\u1e7c t ) TV ,\nwhere \u03c0 i (\u2022|X t ) denotes the conditional distribution of variable i in \u03c0 given the values of the other variables in X t .

Define the coupling as follows. Start in state (X 0 , Y 0 ), and at each timestep, choose a single variable\u0128 t uniformly at random for both chains to sample. Then, choose the delays\u03c4 i,t for the HOGWILD! chain X t . At time t, let\u0168 t denote the state that would be read by chain X's sampler based on the delays. That is, U i,t = X i,t\u2212\u03c4i,t .\nAs done previously, we sample the selected variable\u0128 t in both chains using the optimal coupling guaranteed by Proposition 1. Iterated over time, this defines a full coupling of the two chains.\nWe follow a similar argument as in the above lemmas used to bound the mixing time. First, consider the event that X i,t+1 = Y i,t+1 . This event will occur if one of two things happens: either we didn't sample variable i at time t and X i,t = Y i,t ; or we did sample variable i at time t, and the sampled variables were not equal. Since the probability of sampling variable i is 1 n , and we know the probability that the sampled variables were not equal from Proposition 1, it follows that, by the law of total probability,\nP (X i,t+1 = Y i,t+1 ) = 1 \u2212 1 n P (X i,t = Y i,t ) + 1 n E \u03c0 i (\u2022|\u0168 t ) \u2212 \u03c0 i (\u2022|\u1ef8 t ) TV ,\nwhere \u03c0 i (\u2022|X t ) denotes the conditional distribution of variable i in \u03c0 given the values of the other variables in X t . Next, we apply the Lemma 3, which gives us P (X i,t+1 = Y i,t+1 ) \u2264 1 \u2212 1 n P (X i,t = Y i,t ) + \u03b1 n max j P (U j,t = Y j,t ) = 1 \u2212 1 n P (X i,t = Y i,t ) + \u03b1 n max j \u221e k=0 P (\u03c4 j,t = k) P (X j,t\u2212k = Y j,t ) .\nIn order to evaluate this, we notice that the event X j,t\u2212k = Y j,t can happen only if either X j,t = Y j,t or at some time s, where t \u2212 k \u2264 s < t, we sampled variable j (that is,\u0128 s = j). Therefore, by the union bound, P (X j,t\u2212k = Y j,t ) \u2264 P (X j,t = Y j,t ) +\nt\u22121 s=t\u2212k P \u0128 s = j .\nSince the probability of sampling variable j at any time is always just 1 n , we can reduce this to P (X j,t\u2212k = Y j,t ) \u2264 P (X j,t = Y j,t ) + k n .\nSubstituting this into our previous expression produces P (X i,t+1 = Y i,t+1 ) \u2264 1 \u2212 1 n P (X i,t = Y i,t ) + \u03b1 n max j \u221e k=0 P (\u03c4 j,t = k) P (X j,t = Y j,t ) + k n\n= 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1 n P (X i,t = Y i,t ) + \u03b1 n 2 max j E [\u03c4 j,t ] \u2264 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1 n P (X i,t = Y i,t ) + \u03b1\u03c4 n 2 .\nNow, if we let \u03c6 t = max i P (X i,t = Y i,t ) ,\nthen maximizing the previous expression over i implies that\n\u03c6 t+1 \u2264 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1 n \u03c6 t + \u03b1\u03c4 n 2 .\nSubtracting from both sides to identify the fixed point gives us\n\u03c6 t+1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c4 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)n \u2264 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1 n \u03c6 t + \u03b1\u03c4 n 2 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c4 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)n = 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1 n \u03c6 t \u2212 \u03b1\u03c4 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)n .\nApplying this inequality recursively lets us conclude that\n\u03c6 t \u2212 \u03b1\u03c4 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)n \u2264 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1 n t \u03c6 0 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c4 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)n \u2264 exp \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1 n t ,\nand so,\n\u03c6 t \u2264 exp \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03b1 n t + \u03b1\u03c4 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)n .\nThis is the desired expression.\nLemma 7 (Monotonic Sequence Domination Lemma).

Consider the model on N variables X i , for N odd, where each X i takes on values in {\u22121, 1} and has probability\nThen Gibbs sampling on this model (assuming that we allow the chain to start only at a state X where \u03c0(X) > 0) has mixing time t mix = O(n log n).\nProof of Lemma 8. (This lemma contains much of the technical work needed to prove Statement 1. A higher-level motivation for why we are proving this lemma is furnished in the proof of that result.) Assume that, as we run the chain described in this lemma, we also assign a \"color\" to each of the variables. All variables with an initial value of 1 start out as black, and all other variables start out as white. Let B t denote the set of variables that are colored black at any time t, and let S t denote the sum of all variables that are colored black at that time. We re-color variables according to the following procedure:\n1. Whenever we change a variable's value from \u22121 to 1, if it is colored white, color it black.\n2. Whenever we change a variable's value from \u22121 to 1, if it is already colored black, choose a random variable that had value \u22121 at time t, and if it is white, color it black.\nNote that as a consequence of this result, a variable that is colored white always has value \u22121.\nWe will prove the following sub-result by induction on t: given a time t, set B t , and sum S t , the values of the variables in B t are uniformly distributed over the set of possible assignments that are consistent with S t .\n(Base Case.) The base case is straightforward. Since B 0 is just the set of variables that have value 1, there is only one possible assignment that is consistent with S 0 : the assignment in which all variables take on the value 1. Since this assignment actually occurs with probability 1, the statement holds.\n(Inductive Case.) Assume that the sub-result is true at time t. The sampler chooses a new variable i to sample. One of the following things will happen:\n\u2022 We don't re-color any variables, or change the values of any variables in B t . In this case, B t+1 = B t and S t+1 = S t . Since there is no change to B or S, all consistent assignments of the black variables are still equiprobable.\n\u2022 We don't re-color any variables, but we do change the value of some variable in B t (by changing its value from 1 to \u22121). Since we sampled the variable i at random, all consistent assignments of the black variables will remain equiprobable.\n\u2022 We re-color some variable j black. There are two events that can cause this:\n-We could have sampled variable j (that is i = j), and changed its value from \u22121 to 1. This will happen with probability\n-We could have sampled a variable i = j that is already colored black, changed its value from \u22121 to 1, and then chosen variable j at random to color black. Since, at time t, the number of variables with value \u22121 must be N + 1 2 ,\n(since we are about to change a value from \u22121 to 1), this will happen with probability\nwhere u is the number of black-colored variables that have value \u22121 at time t.\nFrom this analysis, it follows that, given that we re-colored some variable j black, it will have value \u22121 with probability\nIn particular, at time t, the number of variables that are in B t is\nsince all variables with value 1 are in B t , and B t is stipulated to contain u additional variables with value \u22121. It follows that at time t + 1, the number of variables that are in B t is N + 1 2 + u, and there will still be u variables in B t+1 with value \u22121. Therefore, the fraction of variables in B t+1 that have value \u22121 will be\nNote that this is exactly equal to the probability that variable j will have value \u22121. Combining this with the inductive hypothesis shows that the consistent states will all remain equiprobable in this case.\nSince the consistent states remain equiprobable in all of the possible cases, it follows from the law of total probability that the consistent states are equiprobable in all cases. This shows that the sub-result holds in the inductive case.\nWe have now showed that given a time t, set B t , and sum S t , the values of the variables in B t are uniformly distributed over the set of possible assignments that are consistent with S t . This implies that if T 1 is the first time at which the set B t contains all variables, the value of X T is are uniformly distributed over all possible states with 1 T X = 1. Now, we performed this construction for a particular polarity of swaps (i.e. focusing on switches from \u22121 to 1), but by symmetry we could just as easily have used the same construction with the signs of all the variables reversed. If we let T \u22121 be the first time at which the set B t contains all variables using this reverse-polarity construction, then the value of X T is uniformly distributed over all possible states with 1 T X = \u22121.\nLet T * be a random variable that is T 1 with probability 1 2 and T \u22121 with probability 1 2 . It follows that at time T * , the distribution of X T * will be \u03c0. Therefore, T * is a strong stationary time for this chain. By the properties of strong stationary times,\nTo bound the mixing time, we start by noticing that\nIf we letT be the first time at which each variable has been set to 1 at least once, then\nNow, if we sample a variable, the probability that we will set it to 1 is (roughly) 1 4 . It follows from the coupon collector's problem bound that the expected amount of time required to set all variables to 1 at least once is E T = O(n log n).\nCombining this with the previous inequalities lets us conclude that t mix = O(n log n), which proves the lemma.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}], "references": [{"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Rapidly mixing gibbs sampling for a class of factor graphs using hierarchy width", "journal": "", "year": "2015", "authors": "De Sa;  Christopher;  Zhang;  Ce; Kunle Olukotun; Christopher R\u00e9"}, {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Taming the wild: A unified analysis of HOGWILD!-style algorithms", "journal": "", "year": "2015", "authors": "De Sa;  Christopher;  Zhang;  Ce; Kunle Olukotun; Christopher R\u00e9"}, {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Central limit theorem for nonstationary markov chains", "journal": "", "year": "1956", "authors": "R L Dobrushin"}, {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Dobrushin conditions and systematic scan", "journal": "Springer", "year": "2006", "authors": "Martin Dyer; Leslie Goldberg;  Ann; Mark Jerrum"}, {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Parallel gibbs sampling: From colored fields to thin junction trees", "journal": "", "year": "2011", "authors": "Joseph Gonzalez;  Low;  Yucheng; Arthur Gretton; Carlos Guestrin"}, {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Sampling from probabilistic submodular models", "journal": "Curran Associates, Inc", "year": "2015", "authors": "Alkis Gotovos; Hamed Hassani; Andreas ; Krause; C Cortes; N D Lawrence; D D Lee; M Sugiyama; R Garnett; Garnett "}, {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Rapidly mixing markov chains: A comparison of techniques.

For any set of variables I \u2282 {1, . . . , n}, let M I (\u00b5) denote the marginal distribution of the variables in I in the distribution \u00b5. In particular, M I includes all events A that depend only on variables in set I. Next, letX I and\u0232 I denote the values ofX and\u0232 on those variables in I; this will be a coupling of the distributions M I (\u00b5) and M I (\u03bd). Therefore, by Proposition 1,M I (\u00b5) \u2212 M I (\u03bd) SV(\u03c9) \u2264 P X I =\u0232 I = P \u2203i \u2208 I,X i =\u0232 i .Let \u2126 I denote all events in the original probability space \u2126 that depend only on the variables in I. By the definition of total variation distance,M I (\u00b5) \u2212 M I (\u03bd) SV(\u03c9) = max A\u2208\u2126I |\u00b5(A) \u2212 \u03bd(A)| . Therefore, max A\u2208\u2126I |\u00b5(A) \u2212 \u03bd(A)| \u2264 P \u2203i \u2208 I,X i =\u0232 i . Now,since this was true for any I, it is certainly true if we maximize both sides over all I with |I| \u2264 \u03c9. Therefore, max I\u2286{1,...,n}, |I|\u2264\u03c9 max A\u2208\u2126I |\u00b5(A) \u2212 \u03bd(A)| \u2264 max I\u2286{1,...,n}, |I|\u2264\u03c9 P \u2203i \u2208 I,X i =\u0232 i .
