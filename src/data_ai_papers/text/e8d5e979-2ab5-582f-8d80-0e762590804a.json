We introduce the task of automatic generation of a respelling from the word's phonemic representation. Our approach combines machine learning with linguistic constraints and electronic resources. We evaluate our system both intrinsically through a human judgment experiment, and extrinsically by passing its output to a letterto-phoneme converter. The results show that the respellings generated by our system are better on average than those found on the Web, and approach the quality of respellings designed by an expert.", "sections": [{"heading": "Introduction", "text": "Respellings are a widely employed method of conveying the pronunciation of English and foreign words, both in print and on the Web. For example, Huatulco, the name of a Mexican resort, is respelled as 'wah-tool-koh' in a travel guide (Noble, 2012). The advantage of using respellings lies in removing the need for a separately defined phonetic transcription system. Since they contain only the letters of the Latin alphabet, their phonetic interpretation relies exclusively on orthographic intuitions of readers. For this reason, respellings are widely used in travel phrase books, medical compendia, and drug name pronunciation guides, among others.\nDespite their utility, good respellings are not easy to create. Respellings found on the Web often contain errors or ambiguities. For example, Henoch-Schoenlein purpura, a skin disease, is respelled both as 'heh-nok shoon-line purr-puh-ruh' and 'hen-awk sher-line purr-purr-ah'. Does 'heh' rhyme with eh [e] or with Nineveh [@], or is it the same vowel as in hen [E]? Clearly, if both respellings refer to the same pronunciation, at least one of them must be wrong. In addition, converting the pronunciation of a foreign name to English phonemes is in itself a non-trivial task.\nIn this paper, we focus on the task of generating respellings from the intended pronunciation given as a sequence of phonemes. We develop a stand-alone system that combines linguistic knowledge and resources with machine learning models trained on data mined from the Web and electronic dictionaries. One of our ultimate objectives is to aid writers by evaluating their respellings, improving them, or generating new candidates. Accordingly, we endeavour to maintain the generation and the evaluation stages as separate modules in our system.\nThe evaluation of respellings is a challenging problem. Since English spelling conventions are notoriously inconsistent, there is no algorithm for accurately predicting the pronunciation of an out-ofvocabulary word. The current state-of-the-art letterto-phoneme (L2P) converters are typically reported with 10-30% error rates on dictionary words (Bisani and Ney, 2008). On the other hand, human readers often disagree on the details of the pronunciation implied by a respelling. In this paper, we conduct two kinds of evaluations: an automated verification with an independent L2P system, and an experiment with human participants that pass judgments on different respellings of the same word. We interpret the results as evidence that the output of our system compares favourably with typical respellings found on the Web.", "publication_ref": ["b15", "b1"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Definitions and Conventions", "text": "Although Chomsky and Halle (1968) characterize English orthography as close to optimal, Kominek and Black (2006) estimate that it is about 3 times more complex than German, and 40 times more complex than Spanish. This is confirmed by lower accuracy of letter-to-phoneme systems on English (Bisani and Ney, 2008). A survey of English spelling (Carney, 1994) devotes 120 pages to describe phoneme-to-letter correspondences, and lists 226 letter-to-phoneme rules, almost all of which admit exceptions.\nThere is no consensus on how to best convey the pronunciation of an uncommon word in English. Most dictionaries employ either the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), or their own transcription schemes that incorporate special symbols and diacritics. Unfortunately, many readers are unfamiliar with phonetic transcription. Instead, respellings are often preferred by writers in the news and on the Web. In this section, we define the respelling task in detail.", "publication_ref": ["b4", "b13", "b1", "b3"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Form of Respellings", "text": "A respelling is a non-standard spelling of a word, that is intended to better convey its pronunciation. We assume that the pronunciation is defined as a sequence of English phonemes, and that the respelling contains only the 26 letters of the alphabet, with optional hyphenation. Some transcription schemes combine respellings with special symbols for representing certain phonemes. For example, an otherwise purely alphabetic Wikipedia scheme employs the symbol @ for the vowel schwa. In our opinion, such devices destroy the main advantage of respellings, which is their universality, without attaining the precision of a true phonetic transcription. In fact, Fraser (1997) identifies the schwa symbol as the cause of many pronunciation errors.\nIn our system, we consistently use hyphens to segment multi-syllable respellings. Each syllablesize segment contains the representation of exactly one vowel phoneme, so that the number of segments matches the number of syllables. 1 However, the hyphenation need not correspond exactly to the actual syllable breaks. This approach has several advantages. First, individual syllables are easier to pronounce than an entire unfamiliar word. Second, hyphens limit the context that affects the pronunciation of a given letter (e.g. th in Beethoven 'baythoe-ven'). Finally, hyphens indicate whether adjacent vowel letters, such as oe in 'hoe', represent one vowel phoneme or two. Some respellings explicitly indicate the stressed syllable by expressing it in a different font. This is potentially helpful because unstressed vowels tend to be reduced, which changes their pronunciation. However, since the vowel reduction phenomenon is by no means universal, the readers may be unsure whether to apply it to, e.g. the final o in 'KWATro'. In this paper, we make no distinction between stressed and unstressed syllables; instead, we follow the principle that each syllable is to be pronounced as if it was a separate word. Nonetheless, it would be straightforward to project the stress indicators onto the appropriate syllables in the respellings generated by our system.", "publication_ref": ["b5"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Quality of Respellings", "text": "There is no clear-cut distinction between good and bad respellings. The quality of a respelling is more of a subjective opinion rather than a verifiable fact. We propose to evaluate it according to the following three criteria: ambiguity, correctness, and preference.\nA respelling is ambiguous if it is perceived as compatible with more than one pronunciation. Because most of the rules of English spelling have exceptions, it is rarely possible to demonstrate that a respelling is completely unambiguous. However, some respellings are clearly more ambiguous than others. For example, the digraph ee almost always represents the vowel [i], whereas the letter sequence ough can represent several different phonemes. 2 Respellings that contain highly ambiguous letter-phoneme mappings can be expected to be ambiguous themselves. Ambiguity is a property of a respelling itself, regardless of the intended pronunciation.\nA respelling is correct if it accurately conveys the intended pronunciation to the reader. Unlike the am-biguity, correctness can be verified objectively for a particular reader, by comparing the intended pronunciation with the pronunciation inferred by the reader. A respelling that is judged correct with respect to one pronunciation cannot be judged correct with respect to a different pronunciation. Nevertheless, it is entirely possible that different readers will derive different pronunciations from the same respelling.\nA respelling can be classified as unambiguous and yet incorrect by a given reader, but it cannot be judged as simultaneously ambiguous and correct. Indeed, an ambiguous respelling is compatible with at least two pronunciations, only one of which can be the intended pronunciation. Therefore, for a given reader, unambiguity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for correctness.\nGiven two unambiguous and correct respellings, a reader may prefer one over the other, perhaps because of the ease of inferring the intended pronunciation. For example, 'rode-ease-yew' may be preferred to 'roh-dee-zyoo' because the former is entirely composed of actual English words with unique pronunciation, whereas the latter contains an unusual consonant cluster zy. Preference is also expressed implicitly if only one of the alternative respellings is judged as unambiguous (or correct), 3 Related Work Fraser (1997) describes an experiment in which 15 human subjects were asked to pronounce uncommon words after being shown a representation of their pronunciation. The respellings designed by the author were much more effective for that purpose than either the IPA phonetic transcription or phonemic respelling (Section 4.3). However, the creation of respellings was described as labour-intensive, and at least one of them was found to be sub-optimal during the experiment. Williams and Jones (2008) propose respellings as a way of extending pronunciation lexicons by informants who lack linguistic training. Galescu (2009) reports that the addition of respellings of medical terms from an on-line dictionary improves the accuracy of an L2P system. The author identifies an automatic pronunciation-to-respelling system as future work.  extract a large number of respellings from the Web, and show that they can be exploited to improve the accuracy of the L2P conversion by supplementing the data in pronunciation dictionaries. Can et al. (2009) further analyze the effect of using respellings on the accuracy of spokenterm detection (STD) systems.", "publication_ref": ["b5", "b18", "b6", "b2"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Direct Methods", "text": "In this section, we discuss three direct methods of generating respellings: manual design, dictionary lookup, and phonemic respelling.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Manual Design", "text": "Respellings found on the Web and in news articles are usually ad-hoc creations of the authors of those texts. Respellings designed by different writers for the same word are rarely identical. 3 The quality of Web respellings vary.\nThe respellings found in specialized lexicons are more likely to be designed by experts, and are often guided by a set of respelling rules. Nevertheless, such respelling guides may also be ambiguous. 4 Regardless of the source, since respellings are often used for names and foreign words, no lexicon can be expected to provide a complete coverage.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Dictionary Lookup", "text": "Pronunciation dictionaries can be helpful in generating respellings. Assuming that we have a method of dividing pronunciations into syllables, a complete respelling of an out-of-dictionary word can in some cases be automatically derived from the list of syllable pronunciations. For example, hyphy can be respelled as 'high-fee' by following such a procedure. If each of the syllables has a unique pronunciation, such respellings are arguably both unambiguous and correct.\nUnfortunately, only a subset of potential phonemic syllables actually occur in a lexicon. Considering only the syllables of the CVC type (consonantvowel-consonant), there are over ten thousand distinct possibilities (e.g., [bEb], [bES], etc.), of which fewer than three thousand can be found in the Combilex pronunciation dictionary (Richmond et al., 2009). While the dictionary lookup may produce attractive respellings, it is not sufficient for a standalone use.", "publication_ref": ["b16"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Phonemic Respelling", "text": "A simple method that can produce a respelling for any word is to directly map each phoneme to a particular letter or a letter sequence that is frequently used to represent that phoneme. Phonemes such as [m], [d] and [f] are indeed closely associated with individual letters. This is not surprising since the Roman letters were originally created to represent single phonemes in Latin, and some of those phonemes also exist in English. However, many phonemes, especially vowels, have no obvious orthographic representation. One solution is to use digraphs such as ee and aw, but a number of phonemes, such as [aU] as in loud, have no mappings that work in all contexts.\nThe principal weakness of a phonemic respelling is its inflexibility, which often results in counterintuitive respellings. For example, many readers are baffled by respelling such as 'gee' for ghee or 'john' for Joan. Phonemic respelling tends to fail in cases where it generates a sequence of letters that is inherently ambiguous, or which pronunciation changes because of the context. On the other hand, mappings such as uu for [U] and ahy for [aI], which never occur in real English words, are difficult to interpret for some readers.\nIn this paper, we adopt a context-free phonemic respelling scheme as the baseline, with the mappings from the online dictionary Dictionary.com, which differs from the system used in Wikipedia only in a few details.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Candidate Generation", "text": "In this section, we present our syllabification approach, as well as two generation modules: a trained phoneme-to-letter (P2L) model and a rule-based respeller.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Syllabification", "text": "Our respelling generation process is for the most part performed on the level of individual syllables. Correct syllabification is by itself a non-trivial problem, but even if it was provided by an oracle, it might not correspond to the optimal segmentation of a respelling. For example, the word trigonal [trIg@n@l] is usually syllabified as tri-go-nal, but a better segmentation for the purposes of respelling is trig-onal. We adopt an overgenerate-and-rank approach, whereby instead of committing to a specific word segmentation at the start of the process, we process multiple syllabification alternatives in parallel, one of which is ultimately selected at the respelling evaluation stage.\nIdeally, syllabification should conform to the phonotactic constraints of English, so that the resulting respellings are easy to pronounce. The consonant sonority should be rising in onsets, and falling in codas (Kenstowicz, 1994). We verify that syllables follow the sonority principle by following the formulation of Bartlett et al. (2009). The sonority constraints are not tested at the boundaries of the word, which are independent of the syllabification choice. We also incorporate another important principle of English phonotactics that asserts that lax vowels do not occur in open syllables (Rogers, 2000).\nIn our implementation, each candidate syllable is tested with respect to the following sequence of four violable constraints, ordered from the strongest to the weakest: (1) the syllable contains exactly one vowel phoneme; (2) the onset satisfies the sonority principle; (3) if the nucleus contains a lax vowel (except @), the coda is non-empty; (4) the coda satisfies the sonority principle. For a syllabification to be accepted, all its syllables must satisfy the four constraints. However, if this results in rejection of all possible syllabifications, the constraints are gradually relaxed starting from the weakest.\nAs an example, consider the word abandonment [@baend@nm@nt], which has 18 different syllabifications satisfying the VOWEL constraint (Table 1). 8 of the 18 satisfy the ONSET constraint as well, but only two syllabifications satisfy all four constraints: [@b-aen-d@n-m@nt] and [@-baen-d@n-m@nt].", "publication_ref": ["b12", "b0", "b17"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_0"]}, {"heading": "P2L Generator", "text": "The respelling problem can be viewed as a string transduction problem, with the transduction occurring between phonemes and letters. As such, it is directly related to the well-studied letter-to-phoneme conversion task. The difference is that the letters may not conform to the standard orthography of English. If we had a sufficiently large training set of pronunciation-respelling pairs, we could train a machine learning algorithm to directly generate respellings for any strings of English phonemes. However, such a training set is not readily available. The respellings in the corpus collected by  are not easily matched to the phonetic transcriptions, and few of them can be found in electronic pronunciation dictionaries. In addition, the quality of Web respellings vary greatly.\nIn place of a direct pronunciation-to-respelling model, we aim to model the orthographic intuitions of readers by deriving a phoneme-to-letter (P2L) transduction model from an English pronunciation dictionary. A possible criticism of such an approach is that our model may create ambiguous respellings, which abound in English orthography. However, we rely on a separate evaluation module to identify and filter ambiguous respellings at a later stage.\nOur systems utilizes the DIRECTL+ program (Jiampojamarn et al., 2008), which was originally designed for L2P conversion. Since our basic unit is the syllable, rather than the word, we train our P2L model on a set of of 4215 pairs of monosyllabic words and their pronunciations extracted from the Combilex dictionary. We exclude syllables in multisyllabic words from training because their pronunciation is often affected by context. This is consistent with our expectation that the reader will pronounce each hyphen-delimited segment of the respelling as if it was an individual word.\nSince the P2L training data consists of a relatively small set of syllables, we ensure that the phonemeletter alignment is highly accurate. As a preprocess-ing step, we replace the letter x with ks, and we convert digraphs, such as ch and th, to single symbols. The alignment is performed by M2M-ALIGNER (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007), under the restriction that each phoneme is matched to either one or two letter symbols.", "publication_ref": ["b10", "b9"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Context-Sensitive Respeller", "text": "A hand-crafted context-sensitive respeller is intended to complement the trained P2L model described in the previous section. It is similar to to the phonemic respelling approach described in Section 4.3 in that it converts each phoneme to a letter sequence. However, the mappings depend on adjacent phonemes, as well as on the CV pattern of the current syllable. In addition, more than one mapping for a phoneme can be proposed. We designed the mappings by analyzing their frequency and consistency in pronunciation dictionaries.\nThe process of candidate generation involves establishing the pattern of consonants in the input syllable. The consonant mappings are the same as in the baseline, except for [\u011b] and [T], while the vowels yield up to three different letter sequences. For example, [o] is mapped to oh as a default, but also to o if both onset and coda are empty, or to o followed by a consonant and a silent e if the coda is composed of a single consonant. So, given the syllable [tok] as input, the respeller produces two candidates: tohk and toke.\nWe make no claims about the completeness or optimality of the mappings, but in our development experiments we observed that the context-sensitive respeller contributes to the robustness of our system, and in some cases produces more attractive respellings that the P2L model.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Candidate Selection", "text": "We aim at developing a stand-alone method for the assessment of respellings that could be applied regardless of their origin.

The generated pronunciation of each syllable is compared against its intended pronunciation; if any of the syllables fail the test, the entire respelling is rejected.\nThe L2P model is derived using the DIRECTL+ system. The main difference between the L2P model described in this section and the P2L model from Section 5.2 is that the input and output data are reversed. However, the L2P model is not simply a mirror image of the P2L model. Often the phonemic output of the composition of the two models is different from the initial phonemic input; e.g., [ro] \u2192 row \u2192 [raU]. This is because the intermediate orthographic string may be ambiguous. Furthermore, the L2P model is also intended to test the correctness of respellings that were generated with other methods.\nOther differences between the two models pertain to the preprocessing of the training data, and the letter-to-phoneme alignment. As with the P2L model, the training data consists of a set of monosyllabic words from the Combilex dictionary. However, in order to make our correctness filter more conservative, we also remove all words that contain diacritics (e.g., cr\u00eape), non-English phonemes (e.g., avant), or silent consonants (e.g., limn). The alignment is restricted to matching each letter symbol to at most one phoneme, and is derived with the ALINE phonetic aligner (Kondrak, 2000), which has been shown to outperform other 1-1 alignment methods (Jiampojamarn and Kondrak, 2010).", "publication_ref": ["b14", "b8"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Vowel Counter", "text": "Syllables that contain multiple vowel groups may be confusing to readers even if they correctly represent the intended pronunciation.

The ambiguity score of a respelling is defined as the average of scores assigned to each of its syllables. The score can then be used to select the best respelling from a number of candidates generated by our system, or to rate a respelling from another source.\nSince we have no explicit ambiguity annotations for respellings, we attempt instead to exploit ambiguity judgments that are implicitly made when respellings are created by human authors. We approach ambiguity as a binary classification task. For any given syllable, we wish to determine whether it is ambiguous (a negative instance), or unambiguous (a positive instance). Our assumption is that a syllable will not be respelled unless it is necessary due to ambiguity. For each observed word-respelling pair, we take all syllables from the respelling as positive instances, and all syllables in the original word that are not preserved in the respelling as negative instances. For example, the pair consisting of the word cec-il-y respelled as 'sehs-il-ee' provides three positive instances: sehs, il and ee; and two negative instances: cec and y.\nWe extracted word-respelling pairs from the Webderived corpora of . The syllable breaks in the respellings were mapped onto the original words using ALINE.

After the filtering, we were left a set of 25067 word-respelling pairs containing 78411 training syllables, which yielded 47270 positive and 31141 negative instances.\nFor the classification task we utilize the SVMlight software package (Joachims, 1999). Each instance is represented by a set of binary indicator features. The features correspond to character n-grams (including syllable boundary markers) with the values of n ranging from 1 to 5. For example, the syllable -ilturns on the following features: i, l, -i, il, l-, -il, il-, -il-. The model learns which n-grams are characteristic of ambiguous or unambiguous syllables. For example, it classifies both le and li as am-biguous, and lee as unambiguous.

This is done as the final step in the generation process because dictionary words often receive poor scores from the SVM classifier on the account of their n-gram composition.

The automated verification demonstrates that they are also much easier to interpret for a rule-based text-to-speech converter. In the future we plan to address the related tasks of improving existing respellings, and assisting writers in creating respellings without direct access to the phonemic representations.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Acknowledgements", "text": "We thank Aditya Bhargava and Clarke Chomyc for their contribution to the creation of data sets, and Ben Tucker for advice on the complexities of the human evaluation experiment.
