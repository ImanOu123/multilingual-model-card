However, recent advances in neural language models have already reached around 90% accuracy on variants of WSC. This raises an important question whether these models have truly acquired robust commonsense capabilities or whether they rely on spurious biases in the datasets that lead to an overestimation of the true capabilities of machine commonsense. To investigate this question, we introduce WINOGRANDE, a large-scale dataset of 44k problems, inspired by the original WSC design, but adjusted to improve both the scale and the hardness of the dataset.

These results have dual implications: on one hand, they demonstrate the effectiveness of WINOGRANDE when used as a resource for transfer learning.

WSC are designed to be pronoun resolution problems (see examples in Table 1) that are trivial for humans but hard for machines that merely rely on statistical patterns without true capabilities of commonsense reasoning. However, recent advances in neural language models have already reported around 90% accuracy on a variant of WSC dataset. 1 This raises an important question:\nHave neural language models successfully acquired commonsense or are we overestimating the true capabilities of machine commonsense? This question about the potential overestimation leads to another crucial question regarding potential unwanted biases that the large-scale neural language models might be exploiting, essentially solving the problems right, but for wrong reasons. While WSC questions are expert-crafted, recent studies have shown that they are nevertheless prone to incidental biases. Trichelair et al. (2018) have reported word-association (13.5% of the cases, see Table 1 for examples) as well as other types of dataset-specific biases. While such biases and annotation artifacts are not apparent for individual instances, they get introduced in the dataset as problem authors subconsciously repeat similar problem-crafting strategies.\nTo investigate this question about the true estimation of the machine commonsense capabilities, we introduce WINO-GRANDE, a new dataset with 44k problems that are inspired by the original design of WSC, but modified to improve both the scale and hardness of the problems. The key steps in WINOGRANDE construction consist of (1) a carefully designed crowdsourcing procedure, followed by (2) a novel algorithm AFLITE that generalizes human-detectable biases based on word occurrences to machine-detectable biases based on embedding occurrences. The key motivation of our approach is that it is difficult for humans to write problems without accidentally inserting unwanted biases.\nWhile humans find WINOGRANDE problems trivial with 94% accuracy, best state-of-the-art results, including those from RoBERTa (Liu et al. 2019) are considerably lower, ranging between 59.4% -79.1% depending on the amount of training data provided (from 800 to 41k instances), which falls 15 -35% (absolute) below the human-level performance.\nTwin sentences Options (answer)\n(1) a The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it's too large. trophy / suitcase b The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because it's too small. trophy / suitcase\n(2) a Ann asked Mary what time the library closes, because she had forgotten. Ann / Mary b Ann asked Mary what time the library closes, but she had forgotten.\nAnn / Mary\n(3) a The tree fell down and crashed through the roof of my house.

Now, I have to get it repaired. tree / roof (4) a The lions ate the zebras because they are predators. lions / zebras b The lions ate the zebras because they are meaty.\nlions / zebras Table 1: WSC problems are constructed as pairs (called twin) of nearly identical questions with two answer choices. The questions include a trigger word that flips the correct answer choice between the questions. Examples ( 1)-( 3) are drawn from WSC (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2011) and ( 4) from DPR (Rahman and Ng 2012)). Examples marked with have language-based bias that current language models can easily detect. Example ( 4) is undesirable since the word \"predators\" is more often associated with the word \"lions\", compared to \"zebras\" Furthermore, we also demonstrate that WINOGRANDE provides transfer learning to other existing WSC and related benchmarks, achieving new SOTA performances on five of them, including the original WSC (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2011) (\u2192 90.1%), DPR (Rahman and Ng 2012) (\u2192 93.1%), COPA (Roemmele, Bejan, and  (\u2192 90.6%), KnowRef (Emami et al. 2019) (\u2192 85.6%), and Winogender (Rudinger et al. 2018) (\u2192 97.1%).\nAlthough the improvements of SOTA over multiple challenging benchmarks are exciting, we cautiously note that these positive results must be taken with a grain of salt. The result might also indicate the extent to which spurious effects are prevalent in existing datasets, which runs the risk of overestimating the true capabilities of machine intelligence on commonsense reasoning. More generally, human-crafted problems and tasks (regardless of whether they are crowdsourced or by experts) contains annotation artifacts in many cases, and algorithmic bias reduction such as AFLITE is essential to mitigate such dataset-specific bias.\n2 Crowdsourcing WINOGRANDE at Scale WSC problems have been considered challenging to craft by crowdsourcing due to the structural constraints of twins and the requirement of linguistic knowledge (Table 1). Nevertheless, we present an effective approach to creating a large-scale dataset (WINOGRANDE) of WSC problems while maintaining its original properties -i.e. trivial for humans but hard for AI systems. Our approach consists of a carefully designed crowdsourcing task followed by a novel adversarial filtering algorithm ( \u00a73) that systematically removes biases in the data.\nEnhancing Crowd Creativity Creating twin sentences from scratch puts a high cognitive load on crowd workers who thereby subconsciously resort to writing pairs that are lexically and stylistically repetitive. To encourage creativity and reduce their cognitive load, we employed creativity from constraints (Stokes 2005) -a psychological notion which suggests that appropriate constraints can help structure and drive creativity. In practice, crowd workers are primed by a randomly chosen topic as a suggestive context (details below), while they are asked to follow precise guidelines on the structure of the curated data.\nCrowdsourcing Task We collect WINOGRANDE problems via crowdsourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). 2 Workers are asked to write twins sentences (as shown in Table 1) that meet the requirements for WSC problems (e.g., avoiding word association, non-zero but small edit distance). To avoid repeating the same topics, workers were instructed to randomly pick an anchor word(s) from a randomly assigned WikiHow article 3 and to ensure that the twin sentences contain the anchor word. The anchor word does not have to be a trigger word, but we ensured that it is not a function word such as the, it, he, of. In our pilot experiments, we found that this constraint drastically improves worker's creativity and diversity of topics. Additionally, workers were instructed to keep twin sentence length in between 15 and 30 words while maintaining at least 70% word overlap between a pair of twins. 4 Following the original WSC problems, we aimed to collect twins in two different domains -(i) social commonsense: a situation involving two same gender people with contrasting attributes, emotions, social roles, etc., and (ii) physical commonsense: a context involving two physical objects with contrasting properties, usage, locations, etc. In total, we collected 77k questions (i.e., 38k twins).", "publication_ref": ["b18", "b35", "b32", "b20", "b18", "b26", "b18", "b9", "b29", "b31"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Data Validation", "text": "We validate each collected question through a distinct set of three crowd workers. Following a rigorous process, a question is deemed valid if (1) the majority of the three workers chooses the correct answer option, (2) they agree that the two answer options are unambiguous (one option is clearly more plausible than the other) and (3) the question cannot be answered simply by word association in which local context around the target pronoun is given (e.g., \"because it was going so fast.\" (race car / school bus)). 5 As a result, 68% of the questions (53k) were deemed valid and we discarded the invalid questions.\nWhile our crowdsourcing procedure addresses some amount of instance-level biases like word association, it is still possible that the constructed dataset has dataset-specific biases -especially after it has been scaled up. To address this challenge, we propose a method for systematic bias reduction.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Algorithmic Data Bias Reduction", "text": "Several recent studies (Gururangan et al. 2018;Poliak et al. 2018;Tsuchiya 2018;Niven and Kao 2019;Geva, Goldberg, and Berant 2019) have reported the presence of annotation artifacts in large-scale datasets. Annotation artifacts are unintentional patterns in the data that leak information about the target label in an undesired way. State-of-the-art neural models are highly effective at exploiting such artifacts to solve problems correctly, but for incorrect reasons. To tackle this persistent challenge with dataset biases, we propose AFLITEa novel algorithm that can systematically reduce biases using state-of-the-art contextual representation of words.\nLight-weight adversarial filtering Our approach builds upon the adversarial filtering (AF) algorithm proposed by Zellers et al. (2018), but makes two key improvements: (1) AFLITE is much more broadly applicable (by not requiring over generation of data instances) and (2) it is considerably more lightweight (not requiring re-training a model at each iteration of AF). Overgenerating machine text from a language model to use in test instances runs the risk of distributional bias where a discriminator can learn to distinguish between machine generated instances and human-generated ones. In addition, AF depends on training a model at each iteration, which comes at extremely high computation cost when being adversarial to a model like BERT (Devlin et al. 2018). 6 Instead of manually identified lexical features, we adopt a dense representation of instances using their precomputed neural network embeddings. In this work, we use RoBERTa (Liu et al. 2019) fine-tuned on a small subset of the dataset. Concretely, we use 6k instances (5k for training and 1k for validation) from the dataset (containing 53k instances in total) to fine-tune RoBERTa (referred to as RoBERTa embed ). We use RoBERTa embed to pre-compute the embeddings for the rest of the instances (47k) as the input for AFLITE. We discard the 6k instances from the final dataset.\nNext, we use an ensemble of linear classifiers (logistic regressions) trained on random subsets of the data to determine whether the representation used in RoBERTa embed is strongly indicative of the correct answer option. If so, we discard the corresponding instances and proceed iteratively.\nAlgorithm 1 provides the implementation of AFLITE. The algorithm takes as input the pre-computed embeddings X and labels y, along with the size n of the ensemble, the training size m for the classifiers in the ensemble, the size k of the filtering cutoff, and the filtering threshold \u03c4 . At each filtering phase, we train n linear classifiers on different random partitions of the data and we collect their predictions 6 AFLITE is designed for filtering instances so that the resulting dataset is less biased, whereas the original AF algorithm (Zellers et al. 2018) is designed for \"generating and modifying\" individual instances, such as by creating better distractors. AFLITE and AF are therefore different in their goals and hence difficult to compare directly. on their corresponding validation set. For each instance, we compute its score as the ratio of correct predictions over the total number of predictions. We rank the instances according to their score and remove the top-k instances whose score is above threshold \u03c4 . We repeat this process until we remove fewer than k instances in a filtering phase or there are fewer than m remaining instances. When applying AFLITE to WINOGRANDE, we set m = 10, 000, n = 64, k = 500, and \u03c4 = 0.75.\nThis approach is also reminiscent of recent work in NLP on adversarial learning (Chen and Cardie 2018;Belinkov et al. 2019;Elazar and Goldberg 2018). Belinkov et al. (2019) propose an adversarial removal technique for NLI which encourages models to learn representations that are free of hypothesis-only biases. When proposing a new benchmark, however, we cannot enforce that any future model will purposefully avoid learning spurious correlations in the data. In addition, while the hypothesis-only bias is an insightful bias in NLI, we make no assumption about the possible sources of bias in WINOGRANDE. Instead, we adopt a more proactive form of bias reduction by relying on state-of-the-art (statistical) methods to uncover undesirable dataset shortcuts.\nAssessment of AFLITE We assess the impact of AFLITE relative to two baselines: random data reduction and PMIbased filtering. In random data reduction, we randomly subsample the dataset to evaluate how a decrease in dataset size affects the bias. In PMI-based filtering, we compute the difference (f ) of PMIs for each twin (t) as follows:\nf (t 1 , t 2 ) = w\u2208t1 PMI(y = 1; w) \u2212 w\u2208t2 PMI(y = 1; w).\nTechnically, we first pre-computed PMI between a word and the label y = 1 for each word in the dataset, following a method proposed by Gururangan et al. (2018). The sum of PMI value of each token in a given sentence indicates the Figure 1: The effect of debiasing by AFLITE. RoBERTa pre-computed embeddings (applied PCA for dimension reduction) are shown in two-dimensional space (top row) and histograms regarding d 1 (bottom row) with the bin size being 100. Data points are colored depending on the label (i.e., the answer y is option 1 (blue) or 2 (red)). In the histograms, we show the KL-divergence between p(d 1 , y=1) and q(d 1 , y=2).\nd 1 d 2 WinoGrande all (44k) d 1 d 2 Random (12k) d 1 d 2 PMI-filtering (12k) d 1 d 2 WinoGrande debiased (12k)", "publication_ref": ["b13", "b24", "b34", "b22", "b10", "b37", "b5", "b20", "b37", "b3", "b1", "b7", "b1", "b13"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Twin sentences", "text": "Options (answer) The monkey loved to play with the balls but ignored the blocks because he found them exciting.\nballs / blocks The monkey loved to play with the balls but ignored the blocks because he found them dull.\nballs / blocks William could only climb begginner walls while Jason climbed advanced ones because he was very weak.\nWilliam / Jason William could only climb begginner walls while Jason climbed advanced ones because he was very strong.\nWilliam / Jason Robert woke up at 9:00am while Samuel woke up at 6:00am, so he had less time to get ready for school.\nRobert / Samuel Robert woke up at 9:00am while Samuel woke up at 6:00am, so he had more time to get ready for school.\nRobert / Samuel The child was screaming after the baby bottle and toy fell.

We only retain twins that have a small difference in their PMI values as it corresponds to twins that are hard to discriminate. 7 Figure 1 plots RoBERTa pre-computed embeddings whose dimension is reduced to 2D (top) and 1D (bottom) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We observe that WINO-GRANDE all and the two baselines exhibit distinct components between the two correct answer options (i.e., y \u2208 1, 2), whereas such distinction becomes less salient in WINO-GRANDE debiased , which implies that AFLITE successfully reduces the spurious correlation in the dataset (between instances and labels). To quantify the effect, we compute the KL divergence between the samples with answer options. We find that the random data reduction does not reduce the KL diver- 7 We also evaluated other variations of PMIfiltering such as the absolute difference (|f |), max-PMI (max(maxw\u2208t 1 PMI(y; w), maxw\u2208t 2 PMI(y; w))), and tokenpairwised PMI(y; w1, w2 \u2208 t), but we did not observe a significant difference among them. gence (2.53 \u2192 2.51). It is interesting to see that PMI-filtering marginally reduces the KL divergence (\u2192 2.42), although the principal component analysis on the PMI-filtered subset still leads to a significant separation between the labels. On the other hand, in WINOGRANDE debiased , AFLITE reduces the KL divergence dramatically (\u2192 0.12) which suggests that this debiased dataset should be challenging for statistical models that solely rely on spurious correlation.\nWhat bias has been actually detected by AFLITE? Is the bias really spurious and undesirable according to the original WSC's goal? Table 2 presents examples that AFLITE has detected as a dataset-specific bias. We see a structural pattern in the first two twins, where the sentiment between the answer option and the target pronoun are highly correlated. In other words, these problems can be easily answered by simply exploiting the pattern of the polarity (positive or negative). Importantly, this dataset-specific bias is structural rather than at the token level, contrasting with the biases that have been identified in the NLI literature (Gururangan et al. 2018;Poliak et al. 2018), and it is hard to detect these biases using heuristics such as lexical PMI-filtering. Instead of depending on such heuristics, AFLITE is able to detect samples that potentially have such biases algorithmically.\nAfter applying the AFLITE algorithm, we obtain a debiased dataset of 12,282 instances split into training (9,248), development (1,267), and test (1,767) sets. We also release 31k problems that are filtered out by AFLITE for additional training set ( \u00a74) and resource ( \u00a75), resulting in a total number of problems in WINOGRANDE all to be 43,972 (40,938 for training, 1,267 for development, and 1,767 for test).", "publication_ref": ["b13", "b24"], "figure_ref": ["fig_0"], "table_ref": ["tab_0"]}, {"heading": "WINOGRANDE V.S. the Original WSC", "text": "While WINOGRANDE is inspired by the original WSC, we make a few design choices that deviate from the original design guidelines of WSC in order to scale up the dataset considerably while ensuring the hardness of the dataset.\nFirst, WINOGRANDE is formatted as a fill-in-the-blank problem where the blank corresponds to the mention of one of the two names in the context, following the same modification made by other recent WSC variants such as Trinh and Le (2018). 8 In contrast, the original WSC explicitly places a pronoun (instead of a blank). From the modeling stand point, the use of blanks instead of explicit pronouns do not make the problem any easier.\nSecond, while we originally collected all problems in twins, the final questions in the filtered WINOGRANDE debiased are not always twins because it is possible that AFLITE filters out only one of the twin sentences. In WINOGRANDE debiased , about 1/3 of questions are not twins. We also release WINO-GRANDE all (training set) that all consists of twins.\nThird, unlike the original WSC problems that were composed by just a few linguistics experts, WINOGRANDE is authored by crowdworkers. Thus, the language used in WINO-GRANDE reflects the more diverse and noisy language used by crowds. Importantly, laymen still find WINOGRANDE problems easy to solve, with 94% accuracy ( \u00a74).", "publication_ref": ["b33"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Experimental Results", "text": "", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Baseline Models", "text": "We evaluate the WINOGRANDE debiased (dev and test) on methods/models that have been effective on the original WSC.\nWino Knowledge Hunting Wino Knowledge Hunting (WKH) by Emami et al. (2018) is based on an information retrieval approach, where the sentence is parsed into a set of queries and then the model looks for evidence for each answer candidate from the search result snippets. This IR-oriented approach comes from a line of work in coreference resolution (Kobdani et al. 2011;Ratinov and Roth 2012;Bansal and Klein 2012;Zheng et al. 2013;Peng, Khashabi, and Roth 2015).\nEnsemble Neural LMs Trinh and Le ( 2018) is one of the first attempts to apply a neural language model which is pre-trained on a very large corpora (including LM-1-Billion, CommonCrawl, SQuAD, and Gutenberg Books). In this approach, the task is treated as fill-in-the-blank question with binary choice. The target pronoun in the sentence is replaced by each answer candidate and the neural language model provides the likelihood of the two resulting sentences. This simple yet effective approach outperforms previous IR-based methods.\nBERT BERT (Devlin et al. 2018) is another pre-trained neural language model which has bidirectional paths and consecutive sentence representations in hidden layers. We finetune BERT with splitting the input sentence into context and option using the candidate answer as delimiter. The input format becomes [CLS] context [SEP] option [SEP]; e.g., The trophy doesn't fit into the brown suitcase because the\n[SEP] is too large.\n[SEP] (The blank is filled with either option 1 or 2), and the [CLS] token embedding is used to classify which answer option is correct. We used grid-search for hyper-parameter tuning: learning rate {1e \u2212 5, 3e \u2212 5, 5e \u2212 5}, number of epochs {3, 4, 5, 8}, batch-size {8, 16} with three different random seeds.\nRoBERTa RoBERTa (Liu et al. 2019) is an improved variant of BERT that adds more training data with larger batch sizes and training time, as well as other refinements such as dynamic masking. RoBERTa performs consistently better than BERT across many benchmark datasets.\nWord association baseline Using BERT and RoBERTa, we also run the word association baseline (local-contextonly) to check if the dataset can be solved by language-based bias. In this baseline, the model is trained with only local contexts (w t\u22122:EOS ) surrounding the blank to be filled (w t ) (e.g., because the\n[SEP] is too large.\n[SEP]). This is analogous to the hypothesis-only baseline in NLI (Poliak et al. 2018), where the task (dataset) does not require the full context to achieve high performance.\nFinetuning on DPR dataset DPR (Definite Pronoun Resolusiton Dataset), collected by Rahman and Ng (2012), consists of 1,886 WSC style problems written by 30 undergraduate students. Kocijan et al. (2019) have recently shown that BERT finetuned with DPR boosts the performance on WCS (72.2% accuracy). As additional baselines, we finetune BERT and RoBERTa with DPR and evaluate on WINOGRANDE. This allows us to compare the difficulty of WSC and WINO-GRANDE empirically.\nHuman evaluation In addition to the methods described above, we compute human performance as the majority vote of three crowd workers for each question. answer as desired. Regarding the word association (i.e., local context) baselines, both BERT and RoBERTa achieve close to chance-level performance, illustrating that most WINO-GRANDE debiased problems cannot be answered by local context only. Finally, BERT and RoBERTa finetuned with DPR achieve chance-level to below 60% accuracy, which contrast with the performance boosts on WSC (72% by BERT (Kocijan et al. (2019)) and 83% in RoBERTa) and other existing WSC-style problems (shown in \u00a75.3). This indicates that WINOGRANDE debiased consists of more challenging problems than WSC and existing variants.", "publication_ref": ["b8", "b27", "b0", "b38", "b23", "b5", "b20", "b24", "b26", "b16", "b16"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Results", "text": "Learning Curve In order to see the effect of training size, Table 4 shows the performance by RoBERTa trained on different training sizes from 160 to 40k questions.

Importantly, the lower end of the available training data (\u223c800) in the learning curve roughly matches the size of the training data made available in previous variants of WSC (see Table 5).

Overall, RoBERTa fine-tuned on WINOGRANDE helps improve the accuracy on all the related tasks (Table 6), and performs consistently better than when RoBERTa is fine-tuned on DPR. While improvements on some related datasets (particularly WSC, PDP, and DPR) might seem expected, the significant improvement on COPA is not so. The COPA task -identifying causes and effects -is very different from that in WINO-GRANDE. This significant improvement on an unrelated task indicates that WINOGRANDE can serve as a resource for commonsense knowledge transfer.\nImportant Implications We consider that while these positive results over multiple challenging benchmarks are highly encouraging, they may need to be taken with a grain of salt. In particular, these results might also indicate the extent to which spurious dataset biases are prevalent in existing datasets, which runs the risk of overestimating the true capabilities of machine intelligence on commonsense reasoning.\nOur results and analysis indicate the importance of continued research on debiasing benchmarks and the increasing need for algorithmic approaches for systematic bias reduction, which allows for the benchmarks to evolve together with evolving state of the art. We leave it as a future research question to further investigate how much of our improvements are due to dataset biases of the existing benchmarks as opposed to true strides in improving commonsense intelligence.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": ["tab_6"]}, {"heading": "Diagnostics for Gender Bias", "text": "Winogender is designed as diagnostics for checking whether a model (and/or training corpora) suffers from gender bias. The bias is measured by the difference in accuracy between the cases where the pronoun gender matches the occupation's majority gender (called \"non-gotcha\") or not (\"gotcha\"). Formally, it is computed as follows : \u2206F = Acc (Female, Non-gotcha) \u2212 Acc (Female, Gotcha) \u2206M = Acc (Male, Non-gotcha) \u2212 Acc (Male, Gotcha) for female and male cases, respectively.\nLarge values of \u2206F or \u2206M indicate that the model is highly gender-biased, whereas |\u2206F | = |\u2206M | = 0 (along with high accuracy) is the ideal scenario. In addition, if \u2206F or \u2206M is largely negative, it implies that the model is biased in the other way around.\nThe result of the gender-bias diagnostics is shown in Table 7. While we find that the RoBERTa models finetuned on WINOGRANDE and DPR both demonstrate very high accuracy, the gender gap in RoBERTa-WinoGrande is smaller than RoBERTa-DPR.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Conclusions", "text": "We introduce WINOGRANDE, a new collection of 44k WSCinspired problems that is significantly larger than existing variants of the WSC dataset. To create a dataset that is robust against spurious dataset-specific bias, we also present AFLITE -a novel light-weight adversarial filtering algorithm for systematic bias reduction. The resulting dataset is considerably more challenging for existing state-of-the-art models while still being trivially easy for humans. In addition, using WINOGRANDE as a resource, we demonstrate effective transfer learning and achieve state-of-the-art results on several related benchmarks.\nIn parallel, we also emphasize the potential risk of overestimating the performance of the state-of-the-art methods on the existing commonsense benchmarks; these models might be solving the problems right for the wrong reasons, by relying on spurious statistical patterns (annotation artifacts).\nOur work suggests a new perspective for designing benchmarks for measuring progress in AI. Unlike past decades where the community constructed a static benchmark dataset to work on for many years to come, we now need AI algorithms to compose challenges that are hard enough for AI, which requires dynamic datasets that evolve together with the evolving state-of-the-art.", "publication_ref": [], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank the anonymous reviewers, Dan Weld, Noah Smith, Luke Zettlemoyer, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Oren Etzioni, Leora Morgenstern, Ernest Davis, Gary Marcus, and Yuling Gu for their thoughtful feedback.
