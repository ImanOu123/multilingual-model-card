Existing learning algorithms have primarily focused on building actionable meaning representations which can, for example, directly query a database (Liang et al., 2011;Kwiatkowski et al., 2013) or instruct a robotic agent (Chen, 2012;Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013b). However, due to their end-to-end nature, such models must be relearned for each new target application and have only been used to parse restricted styles of text, such as questions and imperatives.\nRecently, AMR (Banarescu et al., 2013) was proposed as a general-purpose meaning representation language for broad-coverage text, and work is ongoing to study its use for variety of applications such as machine translation (Jones et al., 2012) and summarization (Liu et al., 2015). The * Work done at the University of Washington.\nAMR meaning bank provides a large new corpus that, for the first time, enables us to study the problem of grammar induction for broad-coverage semantic parsing. However, it also presents significant challenges for existing algorithms, including much longer sentences, more complex syntactic phenomena and increased use of noncompositional semantics, such as within-sentence coreference. In this paper, we introduce a new, scalable Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG; Steedman, 1996Steedman, , 2000 induction approach that solves these challenges with a learned joint model of both compositional and non-compositional semantics, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on AMR Bank parsing.\nWe map sentences to AMR structures in a twostage process (Section 5). First, we use CCG to construct lambda-calculus representations of the compositional aspects of AMR. CCG is designed to capture a wide range of linguistic phenomena, such as coordination and long-distance dependencies, and has been used extensively for semantic parsing. To use CCG for AMR parsing we define a simple encoding for AMRs in lambda calculus, for example, as seen with the logical form z and AMR a in Figure 1 for the sentence Pyongyang officials denied their involvement. However, using CCG to construct such logical forms requires a new mechanism for non-compositional reasoning, for example to model the long-range anaphoric dependency introduced by their in Figure 1.\nTo represent such dependencies while maintaining a relatively compact grammar, we follow Steedman's (2011) use of generalized Skolem terms, a mechanism to allow global references in lambda calculus. We then allow the CCG derivation to mark when non-compositional reasoning is required with underspecified placeholders. For example, Figure 1 shows an underspecified logical form u that would be constructed by the grammar with the bolded placeholder ID indicating an un-resolved anaphoric reference. These placeholders are resolved by a factor graph model that is defined over the output logical form and models which part of it they refer to, for example to find the referent for a pronoun. Although primarily motivated by non-compositional reasoning, we also use this mechanism to underspecify certain relations during parsing, allowing for more effective search.\nFollowing most work in semantic parsing, we consider two learning challenges: grammar induction, which assigns meaning representations to words and phrases, and parameter estimation, where we learn a model for combining these pieces to analyze full sentences. We introduce a new CCG grammar induction algorithm which incorporates ideas from previous algorithms (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005;Kwiatkowski et al., 2010) in a way that scales to the longer sentences and more varied syntactic constructions observed in newswire text. During lexical generation (Section 6.1), the algorithm first attempts to use a set of templates to hypothesize new lexical entries. It then attempts to combine bottom-up parsing with top-down recursive splitting to select the best entries and learn new templates for complex syntactic and semantic phenomena, which are re-used in later sentences to hypothesize new entries.\nFinally, while previous algorithms (e.g., Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005) have assumed the existence of a grammar that can parse nearly every sentence to update its parameters, this does not hold for AMR Bank. Due to sentence complexity and search errors, our model cannot produce fully correct logical forms for a significant portion of the training data. To learn from as much of the data as possible and accelerate learning, we adopt an early update strategy to generate effective updates from partially correct analyses (Section 6.2).\nWe evaluate performance on the publicly available AMR Bank (Banarescu et al., 2013) and demonstrate that our modeling and learning contributions are crucial for grammar induction at this scale and achieve new state-of-the-art results for AMR parsing (Section 8). In addition, we also present, for the first time, results without surfaceform alignment heuristics, which demonstrates the need for future work, especially to generalize to other languages. The source code and learned models are available online. 1 Figure 1: A sentence (x) paired with its AMR (a), underspecified logical form (u), which contains underspecified constants in bold that are mapped to AMR relations to generate the fully specified logical form (z).", "publication_ref": ["b44", "b45", "b29", "b29", "b22", "b8", "b3", "b4", "b19", "b30", "b39", "b40", "b41", "b45", "b24", "b45", "b4"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Technical Overview", "text": "Task Let X be the set of all possible sentences and A the set of all AMR structures. Given a sentence x \u2208 X , we aim to generate an AMR a \u2208 A. We define a simple, deterministic and invertible conversion process between AMRs and lambdacalculus logical forms; roughly speaking, each AMR variable gets its own lambda term, which is scoped as low as possible, and each AMR role becomes a binary predicate applied to these variables. Figure 1 shows an example, and the full details are provided in the supplementary materials. Therefore, henceforth we discuss the task of mapping a sentence x \u2208 X to a logical form z \u2208 Z, where Z is the set of all logical forms. For example, in Figure 1, we would map the sentence x to the logical form z. We evaluate system performance using SMATCH (Cai and Knight, 2013).\nModel Given a sentence x and lexicon \u039b, we generate the set of possible derivations GEN(x, \u039b) using a two-stage process (Section 5). First, we use a weighted CCG to map x to an underspecified logical form u (Section 5.1), a logical form with placeholder constants for unresolved elements. For example, in the underspecified logical form u in Figure 1, the constants REL-of, REL and ID are placeholders. We then resolve these placeholders by defining a factor graph to find their optimal mapping and generate the final logical form z. In the figure, REL-of is mapped to ARG0-of, REL to ARG2 and ID to 2.\nLearning We assume access to a training set of N examples {(x i , z i ) : i = 1 . . . N }, each containing a sentence x i and a logical form z i . Our goal is to learn a CCG, which constitutes learning the lexicon and estimating the parameters of both the grammar and the factor graph. We define a learning procedure (Section 6) that alternates between expanding the lexicon and updating the parameters. Learning new lexical entries relies on a two-pass process that combines learning the meaning of words and new syntactic structures, and supports learning with and without alignment heuristics (e.g., from Flanigan et al., 2014).", "publication_ref": ["b7", "b14"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Related Work", "text": "The problem of learning semantic parsers has received significant attention. Algorithms have been developed for learning from different forms of supervision, including logical forms (Wong and Mooney, 2007;Muresan, 2011), question-answer pairs (Clarke et al., 2010;Liang et al., 2011;Cai and Yates, 2013;Kwiatkowski et al., 2013), sentences paired with demonstrations (Goldwasser and Roth, 2011;Chen and Mooney, 2011), conversational logs (Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2011), distant supervision Mitchell, 2012, 2015;Reddy et al., 2014) and without explicit semantic supervision (Poon, 2013).\nAlthough we are first to consider using CCG to build AMR representations, our work is closely related to existing methods for CCG semantic parsing. Previous CCG induction techniques have either used hand-engineered lexical templates (e.g., Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005) or learned templates from the data directly (e.g., Kwiatkowski et al., 2010Kwiatkowski et al., , 2012. Our two-pass reasoning for lexical generation combines ideas from both methods in a way that greatly improves scalability to long, newswire-style sentences. CCG has also been used for broad-coverage recovery of firstorder logic representations (Bos, 2008;Lewis and Steedman, 2013). However, this work lacked corpora to evaluate the logical forms recovered.\nAMR (Banarescu et al., 2013) is a generalpurpose meaning representation and has been used in a number of applications (Pan et al., 2015;Liu et al., 2015). There is also work on recovering Figure 2: Example CCG tree with three lexical entries, two forward applications (>) and type-shifting of a plural noun to a noun phrase.\nAMRs, including graph parsing (Flanigan et al., 2014), methods to build AMRs from dependency trees (Wang et al., 2015) and algorithms for aligning words to AMRs (Pourdamghani et al., 2014).", "publication_ref": ["b43", "b32", "b11", "b29", "b6", "b22", "b15", "b9", "b1", "b38", "b35", "b45", "b24", "b23", "b5", "b27", "b4", "b34", "b30", "b14", "b42", "b36"], "figure_ref": ["fig_3"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Background", "text": "Combinatory Categorial Grammar CCG is a categorial formalism that provides a transparent interface between syntax and semantics (Steedman, 1996(Steedman, , 2000. Section 7 details our instantiation of CCG. In CCG trees, each node is a category. Figure 2 shows a simple CCG tree.\nFor example, S\\N P\n[pl] : \u03bbx.\u03bbd.dance-01(d) \u2227 ARG0(d, x\n) is a category for an intransitive verb phrase. The syntactic type S\\N P [pl] indicates that an argument of type N P [pl] is expected and the returned syntactic type will be S. The backward slash \\ indicates the argument is expected on the left, while a forward slash / indicates it is expected on the right. The syntactic attribute pl specifies that the argument must be plural. Attribute variables enforce agreement between syntactic attributes. For example, as in Figure 2, adjectives are assigned the syntax\nN [x] /N [x]\n, where x is used to indicate that the attribute of the argument will determine the attribute of the returned category. The simply-typed lambda calculus logical form in the category represents its semantic meaning. The typing system includes basic types (e.g., entity e, truth value t) and functional types (e.g., e, t is the type of a function from e to t). In the example category, \u03bbx.\u03bbd.dance-01(d) \u2227 ARG0(d, x) is a e, e, t -typed function expecting an ARG0 argument, and the conjunction specifies the roles of the dance-01 frame.\nA CCG is defined by a lexicon and a set of combinators. The lexicon pairs words and phrases with their categorial meaning. For example, dance \u03bbx.\u03bbd.dance-01(d) \u2227 ARG0(d, x) pairs dance with the category above. We adopt a factored representation of the lexicon (Kwiatkowski et al., 2011), where entries are dynamically generated by combining lexemes and templates. For example, the above lexical entry can be generated by pairing the lexeme dance, {dance-01} with the template \u03bbv 1 .[S\\N P : \u03bbx.\u03bba.v 1 (a) \u2227 ARG0(a, x)].\nSkolem Terms and IDs Generalized Skolem terms (henceforth, Skolem terms) for CCG were introduced by Steedman (2011) to capture complex dependencies with relatively local quantification. We define here a simplified version of the theory to represent entities and allow distant references. Let A be a e, t , e -typed predicate. Given a e, t -typed logical expression C, the logical form A n (C) is a Skolem term with the Skolem ID n. For example, A 2 (\u03bby.boy(y)) is a Skolem term that could represent the noun phrase the boy, which introduces a new entity. Skolem IDs are globally scoped, i.e., they can be referred from anywhere in the logical form without scoping constraints. To refer to Skolem terms, we define the id, e -typed predicate R. For example, the sentence the boy loves himself may be represented with A 1 (\u03bbx.love-01(x) \u2227 ARG0(x, A 2 (\u03bby.boy(y))) \u2227 ARG1(x, R(2))), where R(2) references A 2 (\u03bby.boy(y)).", "publication_ref": ["b39", "b40", "b25"], "figure_ref": ["fig_3", "fig_3"], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Mapping Sentences to Logical Form", "text": "Given a sentence x and lexicon \u039b, the function GEN(x, \u039b) defines the set of possible derivations.

During learning, we assume access to fully specified logical forms, which we convert to underspecified form as needed. In practice, all binary relations, except ARG0 and ARG1, and all Skolem ID references are underspecified.\nFormally, let C be the set of all constants and I(u) the set of all Skolem IDs in the logical form u. Let S u : C \u2192 2 C\u222aI(u) be a specification func-tion, such that its inverse is deterministic. We call a constant c a placeholder if |S u (c)| > 1. Given an underspecified logical form u, applying S u to all constants u contains, generates a set of fully specified logical forms.\nWe define S u to be (a) S u (ID) = I(u), the set of Skolem IDs in u, (b) S u (REL) = {part, ARG2, . . . }, all 67 active AMR relations except ARG0 and ARG1, (c) S u (REL-of) = {part-of, ARG0-of, . . . }, all 33 passive relations, and otherwise (d) S u (c) = c.

For example, in Figure 3b, CONSTS(u) contains, among others, three different occurrences of ARG1 and one of ID, and M maps REL to ARG2, REL-of to ARG0-of and ID to the Skolem ID 2. The set of potential assignments for each occurrence of constant c is S u (c), and M, which returns a single element for each constant, is a disambiguation of S u . Applying M to all constants in u results in the final logical form z.\nDecomposing the derivation provides two advantages. First, we are able to defer decisions from the CCG parse to the factor graph, thereby considering fewer hypotheses during parsing and simplifying the computation.

Factor C2 captures a selectional preference triplet involve-01/ARG1/person that will be created if ID is resolved to the Skolem ID 2. Finally, C3 captures a similar preference for resolving ID to 3.

If generating new lexemes is sufficient to derive z from x, D + will contain these derivations and we return their lexical entries to be added to the lexicon \u039b (lines 5-7). Otherwise, we proceed to do a second pass, where we try to generate new templates to parse the sentence.\nSecond Pass: RECSPLIT In this pass we try to generate max-scoring derivations in a top-down process. Starting from u, the underspecified form of z, we search for CCG parsing steps that will connect to existing partial derivations in the CKY chart to create a complete parse tree. Since the space of possible operations is extremely large, we use CCGBank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007) categories to prune, as described below.\nThe second pass is executed by calling RECSPLIT(x, z, \u03b8, \u039b + ), which returns a set of lexical entries to add to the model (line 10). We recursively apply the splitting operation introduced by Kwiatkowski et al. (2010). Given a CCG category, splitting outputs all possible category pairs that could have originally generated it. For example, given the category S\\N P \u03bby.\u03bbd.deny-01(d\n) \u2227 ARG0(d, y) \u2227 ARG1(d, A 1 (\u03bbi.involve-01(i) \u2227 ARG1(i, R(ID)))),\none of the possible splits will include the categories S\\N P/N P \u03bbx.\u03bby.\u03bbd.deny-01(d) \u2227 ARG0(d, y) \u2227 ARG1(d, x) and N P A 1 (\u03bbi.involve-01(i) \u2227 ARG1(i, R(ID))) which would combine with forward application (>). Kwiatkowski et al. (2010) present the full details. 6 The process starts from u, the underspecified form of z, and recursively applies the splitting operation while ensuring that: (1) there is at most one entry from G gen or one entry where both the template and lexemes are new in the derivation, (2) each parsing step must have at least one child that may be constructed from an existing partial derivation, and (3) for each new parsing step, the syntax of a newly generated child must match the syntax of a CCGBank category for the same span. To search the space of derivations we populate a CKY chart and do a top-down beam search, where in each step we split categories for smaller spans.", "publication_ref": ["b17", "b24", "b24"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Gradient Computation: COMPUTEGRAD", "text": "Given a sentence x, its labeled logical form z, parameters \u03b8 and lexicon \u039b, the procedure COMPUTEGRAD(x, z, \u03b8, \u039b) computes the gradient for the sample (x, z).\nLet D * (z) = GENMAX(x, z, \u03b8, \u039b), the set of max-scoring correct derivations. The hard gradient update is:\n1 |D * (z)| d\u2208D * (z) \u03c6(xi, d) \u2212 E p(d,|x i ;\u03b8,\u039b) [\u03c6(xi, d)] , (2)\nwhere \u03c6(x, d) \u2208 R l is a l-dimensional feature vector (Section 5.3) and the positive portion of the gradient, rather than using expected features, averages over all max-scoring correct derivations.\nEarly updates To generate an effective update when no correct derivation is observed, we follow Collins and Roark (2004) and do an early update if D * (z) is empty or if GEN(x, \u039b), the set of derivations for x, does not contain a derivation with the correct final logical form z. Given the partial derivations, our gradient computation is identical to Equation 2. However, in contrast to Collins and Roark (2004) our data does not include gold derivations. Therefore, we attempt to identify max-scoring partial derivations that may lead to the correct derivation. We extract sub-expressions from u, 7 the underspecified form of z, and search the CKY chart for the top-scoring non-overlapping spans that contain categories with these logical forms. We use the partial derivations leading to these cells to compute the gradient.\nThe benefit of early updates is two-fold. First, as expected, it leads to higher quality updates that are focused on the errors the model makes. Second, given the complexity of the data, it allows us to have updates for many examples that would be otherwise ignored. In our experiments, we observe this behavior with nearly 40% of the training set.", "publication_ref": ["b12", "b12"], "figure_ref": [], "table_ref": []}, {"heading": "Experimental Setup", "text": "Data, Tools and Metric For evaluation, we use AMR Bank release 1.0 (LDC2014T12). We use the proxy report portion, which includes newswire articles from the English Gigaword corpus, and follow the official split for training, development and evaluation (6603/826/823 sentences). We use EasyCCG (Lewis and Steedman, 2014) trained with the re-banked CCGBank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2007;Honnibal et al., 2010) to generate CCGBank categories, the Illinois Named Entity Tagger (Ratinov and Roth, 2009) for NER, Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014) for tokenization and part-of-speech tagging and UW SPF (Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013a) to develop our system. We use SMATCH (Cai and Knight, 2013) to evaluate logical forms converted back to AMRs.\nCCG We use three syntactic attributes: singular sg, mass nouns nb and plural pl. When factoring lexical entries, we avoid extracting binary relations and references, and leave them in the template. We use backward and forward binary combinators for application, composition and crossing composition. We allow non-crossing composition up to the third order. We also add rules to handle punctuation and unary rules for typeshifting non-adjectives in adjectival positions and verb phrases in adverbial positions. We allow shifting of bare plurals, mass nouns and named entities to noun phrases. To avoid spurious ambiguity during parsing, we use normal-form constraints (Hockenmaier and Bisk, 2010). We use five basic lambda calculus types: entity e, truth value t, identifier id, quoted text txt and integer i.\nFeatures During CCG parsing, we use indicator features for unary type shifting, crossing composition, lexemes, templates and dynamically generated lexical entries. We also use indicators for co-occurrence of part-of-speech tags and syntactic attributes, repetitions in logical conjunctions and attachments in the logical form. In the factor graph, we use indicator features for control structures, parent-relation-child selectional preferences and for mapping a relation to its final form.

First, we run our inference procedure (Section 5.4). If no derivations are generated, we run inference again, allowing the parser to skip words at a fixed cost and use the entries for related words if a word is unknown. We find related words in the lexicon using case, plurality and inflection string transformations. Finally, if necessary, we heuristically transform the logical forms at the root of the CCG parse trees to valid AMR logical forms.

We compare our approach to the latest, fixed version of JAMR (Flanigan et al., 2014) available online, 8 the only system to report test results on the official LDC release. Our approach outperforms JAMR by 3 SMATCH F1 points, with a significant gain in recall. Given consensus inter-annotator agreement of 83 SMATCH F1 (Flanigan et al., 2014), this improvement reduces the gap between automated methods and human performance by 15%. Although not strictly comparable, Table 1 also includes results on the pre-release AMR Bank corpus, including the published JAMR results, their fixed results and the results of Wang et al. (2015).\nTable 2 shows SMATCH scores for the developments set, with ablations. The supplementary material includes example output derivations and qualitative comparison to JAMR outputs. We first remove underspecifying constants, which leaves the factor graph to resolve only references. While the expressivity of the model remains the same, more decisions are considered during parsing, modestly impacting performance.\nWe also study the different methods for lexical generation. Skipping the second recursive splitting pass in GENENTRIES creates an interesting tradeoff. As we are unable to learn templates without splitting, we induce a significantly smaller lexicon (500K vs. 1.6M entries). Although we are unable to recover many syntactic constructions, our search problem is in general much simpler. We therefore see a relatively mild drop in overall performance (1.1 F1). Removing G gen during lexical generation (Section 6.1) creates a more significant drop in performance (3.4 F1), demonstrating how considering all possible lexemes allows the system to recover entries that are not covered by heuristic alignments. We are also able for the first time to report AMR parsing results without any surface-form similarity heuristics, by removing both JAMR alignments and named-entity matching lexical generation (Section 6.1). The significant drop in performance (20 points F1) demonstrates the need for better alignment algorithm.\nFinally, Figure 5 plots development SMATCH F1 with and without early updates.

Although our technique is able to learn certain idioms as multi-word phrases, learning to recognize discontinuous idioms remains open.
