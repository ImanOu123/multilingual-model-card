167,fuzzy set,"In classical set theory , the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a bivalent condition — an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast, fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a membership function valued in the real unit interval [0, 1]. Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets, since the indicator functions (aka characteristic functions ) of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1. [186] In fuzzy set theory, classical bivalent sets are usually called crisp sets . The fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is incomplete or imprecise, such as bioinformatics . [187]",模糊集,مجموعة ضبابية,Ensemble flou,ファジィ集合,нечеткое множество

The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly, and in many cases retrieved with one operation. Graph databases hold the relationships between data as a priority. Querying relationships within a graph database is fast because they are perpetually stored within the database itself.

A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed.

318,statistical classification,"In machine learning and statistics , classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.  Examples are assigning a given email to the ""spam"" or ""non-spam"" class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.).

319,statistical relational learning,"A subdiscipline of artificial intelligence and machine learning that is concerned with domain models that exhibit both uncertainty (which can be dealt with using statistical methods) and complex, relational structure. [306] [307] Note that SRL is sometimes called Relational Machine Learning (RML) in the literature. Typically, the knowledge representation formalisms developed in SRL use (a subset of) first-order logic to describe relational properties of a domain in a general manner ( universal quantification ) and draw upon probabilistic graphical models (such as Bayesian networks or Markov networks ) to model the uncertainty; some also build upon the methods of inductive logic programming .",统计关系学习,التعلم العلائقي الإحصائي,Apprentissage relationnel statistique,統計的関係学習,Статистическое реляционное обучение

325,supervised learning,"The machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. [310] It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples . [311] In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal ).  A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances.

345,Turing test,"A test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human, developed by Alan Turing in 1950. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. [329] If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. The test results do not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only how closely its answers resemble those a human would give.",图灵测试,اختبار تورينج,Test de Turing,チューリングテスト,Тест Тьюринга
346,type system,"In programming languages , a set of rules that assigns a property called type to the various constructs of a computer program , such as variables , expressions , functions , or modules . [330] These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types , data structures, or other components (e.g. ""string"", ""array of float"", ""function returning boolean""). The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs [331] by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically (at compile time ), dynamically (at run time ), or as a combination of static and dynamic checking.
